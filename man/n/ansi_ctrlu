DESCRIPTION
       WARNING: This package is unix-specific and depends on the availability of
       two unix system commands for terminal control, i.e. stty and tput, both
       of which have to be found in the $PATH. If any of these two commands is
       missing the loading of the package will fail.

       The package provides commands to switch the standard input of the current
       process between raw and cooked input modes, and to query the size of
       terminals, i.e. the available number of columns and lines.

API
   INTROSPECTION
       ::term::ansi::ctrl::unix::import ?ns? ?arg...?
              This command imports some or all attribute commands into the
              namespace ns. This is by default the namespace ctrl. Note that
              this is relative namespace name, placing the imported command into
              a child of the current namespace. By default all commands are
              imported, this can howver be restricted by listing the names of
              the wanted commands after the namespace argument.

   OPERATIONS
       ::term::ansi::ctrl::unix::raw
              This command switches the standard input of the current process to
              raw input mode. This means that from then on all characters typed
              by the user are immediately reported to the application instead of
              waiting in the OS buffer until the Enter/Return key is received.

       ::term::ansi::ctrl::unix::raw
              This command switches the standard input of the current process to
              cooked input mode. This means that from then on all characters
              typed by the user are kept in OS buffers for editing until the
              Enter/Return key is received.

       ::term::ansi::ctrl::unix::columns
              This command queries the terminal connected to the standard input
              for the number of columns available for display.

       ::term::ansi::ctrl::unix::rows
              This command queries the terminal connected to the standard input
              for the number of rows (aka lines) available for display.
