DESCRIPTION
       This package provides commands to query and modify JPEG images. JPEG
       stands for Joint Photography Experts Group and is a standard for the
       lossy compression of photographical images. It is specified at LINK_HERE.

COMMANDS
       ::jpeg::isJPEG file
              Returns a boolean value indicating if file is a JPEG image.

       ::jpeg::imageInfo file
              Returns a dictionary with keys version, units, xdensity, ydensity,
              xthumb, and ythumb. The values are the associated properties of
              the JPEG image in file.  Throws an error if file is not a JPEG
              image.

       ::jpeg::dimensions file
              Returns the dimensions of the JPEG file as a list of the
              horizontal and vertical pixel count.  Throws an error if file is
              not a JPEG image.

       ::jpeg::getThumbnail file
              This procedure will return the binary thumbnail image data, if a
              JPEG thumbnail is included in file, and the empty string
              otherwise. Note that it is possible to include thumbnails in
              formats other than JPEG although that is not common. The command
              finds thumbnails that are encoded in either the JFXX or EXIF
              segments of the JPEG information. If both are present the EXIF
              thumbnail will take precedence.  Throws an error if file is not a
              JPEG image.

                  set fh [open thumbnail.jpg w+]
                  fconfigure $fh -translation binary -encoding binary
                  puts -nonewline $fh [::jpeg::getThumbnail photo.jpg]
                  close $fh


       ::jpeg::getExif file ?section?
              section must be one of main or thumbnail.  The default is main.
              Returns a dictionary containing the EXIF information for the
              specified section.  For example:


                  set exif {
                   Make     Canon
                   Model    {Canon DIGITAL IXUS}
                   DateTime {2001:06:09 15:17:32}
                  }

              Throws an error if file is not a JPEG image.

       ::jpeg::formatExif keys
              Takes a list of key-value pairs as returned by getExif and formats
              many of the values into a more human readable form. As few as one
              key-value may be passed in, the entire exif is not required.

                  foreach {key val} [::jpeg::formatExif [::jpeg::getExif photo.jpg]] {
                      puts "$key: $val"
                  }



                  array set exif [::jpeg::getExif photo.jpg]
                  puts "max f-stop: [::jpeg::formatExif [list MaxAperture $exif(MaxAperture)]]


       ::jpeg::exifKeys
              Returns a list of the EXIF keys which are currently understood.
              There may be keys present in getExif data that are not understood.
              Those keys will appear in a 4 digit hexadecimal format.

       ::jpeg::removeExif file
              Removes the Exif data segment from the specified file and replaces
              it with a standard JFIF segment.  Throws an error if file is not a
              JPEG image.

       ::jpeg::stripJPEG file
              Removes all metadata from the JPEG file leaving only the image.
              This includes comments, EXIF segments, JFXX segments, and
              application specific segments.  Throws an error if file is not a
              JPEG image.

       ::jpeg::getComments file
              Returns a list containing all the JPEG comments found in the file.
              Throws an error if file is not a valid JPEG image.

       ::jpeg::addComment file text...
              Adds one or more plain text comments to the JPEG image in file.
              Throws an error if file is not a valid JPEG image.

       ::jpeg::removeComments file
              Removes all comments from the file specified.  Throws an error if
              file is not a valid JPEG image.

       ::jpeg::replaceComment file text
              Replaces the first comment in the file with the new text.  This is
              merely a shortcut for ::jpeg::removeComments and
              ::jpeg::addComment Throws an error if file is not a valid JPEG
              image.

       ::jpeg::debug file
              Prints everything we know about the given file in a nice format.

       ::jpeg::markers channel
              This is an internal helper command, we document it for use by
              advanced users of the package. The argument channel is an open
              file handle positioned at the start of the first marker (usually 2
              bytes). The command returns a list with one element for each JFIF
              marker found in the file. Each element consists of a list of the
              marker name, its offset in the file, and its length. The offset
              points to the beginning of the sections data, not the marker
              itself.  The length is the length of the data from the offset
              listed to the start of the next marker.

LIMITATIONS
       can only work with files cant write exif data gps exif data not parsed
       makernote data not yet implemented
