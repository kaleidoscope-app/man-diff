DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::selectionbox command creates a scrolled list of items and a
       selection entry field.  The user may choose any of the items displayed in
       the scrolled list of alternatives and the selection field will be filled
       with the choice.  The user is also free to enter a new value in the
       selection entry field.  Both the list and entry areas have labels.  A
       child site is also provided in which the user may create other widgets to
       be used in conjunction with the selection box.


METHODS
       The iwidgets::selectionbox command creates a new Tcl command whose name
       is pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on
       the widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.


ASSOCIATED METHODS
       curselection    delete         index           nearest
       scan            selection      size

       See the "listbox" widget class manual entry for details on the associated
       methods.


WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::selectionbox command.

       pathName childsite
              Returns the child site widget path name.

       pathName clear component
              Delete the contents of either the selection entry widget or items
              list.  The component argument may be either items or selection.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::selectionbox command.

       pathName get
              Returns the current value of the selection entry widget.

       pathName insert component args
              Insert element(s) into either the selection entry widget or items
              list.  The component argument may be either items or selection.
              The args follow the rules of either an entry or list widget
              depending on the component value.

       pathName selectitem
              Replace the selection entry field contents with the currently
              selected items value.
