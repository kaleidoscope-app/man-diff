DESCRIPTION
       This package provides higher level control sequences for more complex
       shapes.

API
   INTROSPECTION
       ::term::ansi::code::macros::names
              This command is for introspection. It returns as its result a list
              containing the names of all attribute commands.

       ::term::ansi::code::macros::import ?ns? ?arg...?
              This command imports some or all attribute commands into the
              namespace ns. This is by default the namespace macros. Note that
              this is relative namespace name, placing the imported command into
              a child of the current namespace. By default all commands are
              imported, this can howver be restricted by listing the names of
              the wanted commands after the namespace argument.

   SEQUENCES
       ::term::ansi::code::macros::menu menu
              The description of a menu is converted into a formatted
              rectangular block of text, with the menu command characters
              highlighted using bold red text.  The result is returned as the
              result of the command.

              The description, menu, is a dictionary mapping from menu label to
              command character.

       ::term::ansi::code::macros::frame string
              The paragraph of text contained in the string is padded with
              spaces at the right margin, after normalizing internal tabs, and
              then put into a frame made of box-graphics. The result is returned
              as the result of the command.
