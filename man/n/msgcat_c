DESCRIPTION
       The package doctools::msgcat::toc::c is a support module providing the C
       language message catalog for the doctoc parser in the doctools system
       version 2. As such it is an internal package a regular user (developer)
       should not be in direct contact with.

       [1]    doctools::doc,

       [2]    doctools::toc, or

       Within the system architecture this package resides under the package

       loaded dynamically.
