DESCRIPTION
       The canvasLabel class brings some Tk label widget functionality to the
       canvas text item, such as a background and a border.

       The canvasLabel is built with a bullet rectangle on the left side of the
       text. The relief changes according to the select state, with a
       traditionally sunken relief when selected.

       The label has a specific tag, which can be used to retrieve the
       coordinates of the object or move it, thanks to the canvas facilities.

       stooop::new canvasLabel canvas ?options?
              Creates a canvasLabel object in the specified Tk canvas. The
              canvasLabel object identifier is returned (referred to as
              canvasLabelObject in this document).

       switched::configure canvasLabelObject ?options?
              Configures a canvasLabel object or returns all the options with
              their current values if no options are passed as parameters.

       switched::cget canvasLabelObject option
              Returns an option value for the specified canvasLabel object.

       stooop::delete canvasLabelObject
              Deletes the specified canvasLabel object.

OPTIONS
       -anchor value
              Specifies the anchor position of the rectangle and the text,
              relative to the positioning point. The behavior is similar to the
              -anchor option of the canvas text item, except that the rectangle
              is taken into account. The default is center.

       -background color
              Specifies the background color of the bullet rectangle, as in the
              -fill option of the canvas rectangle item. The default is
              transparent (empty string).

       -bordercolor color
              Specifies the border color of the rectangle, as in the -outline
              option of the canvas rectangle item. The default is black.

       -borderwidth value
              Specifies the border width of the rectangle, as in the -width
              option of the canvas rectangle item. By default, the width is 1
              pixel, which is the minimum width.

       -bulletwidth value
              Specifies the width of the rectangle placed to the left of the
              text. Defaults to 10.

       -font value
              Specifies the font of the text, as in the -font option of the
              canvas text item. The default is system dependent.

       -foreground color
              Specifies the color of the text, as in the -fill option of the
              canvas text item. The default is black.

       -justify value
              Specifies how to justify the text, as in the -justify option of
              the canvas text item. The default is left.

       -minimumwidth value
              The total label width will not go below the specified value, but
              may be larger if the label text requires it.

       -padding value
              Specifies how much space to leave between the text and the closest
              rectangle edge. Units are identical to those specified in the
              canvas COORDINATES manual section.

       -scale list
              List of 2 floating point numbers used to set the scaling factor in
              the x and y axis. Scaling is applied immediately and defaults to
              1.

       -select boolean
              Sets the label state.

       -selectrelief value
              Either flat, raised or sunken. Specifies the 3D effect desired for
              the text area when the label is selected.

       -stipple bitmap
              Specifies the stipple pattern filling the rectangle, as in the
              -stipple option of the canvas rectangle item. There is no bitmap
              by default.

       -text text
              Specifies the string to be displayed in the text area, as in the
              -text option of the canvas text item. The default is an empty
