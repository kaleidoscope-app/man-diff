DESCRIPTION
       Are you lost ?  Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In
       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to Parser
       Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the current
       package is a part of.

       This package is an adjunct to pt::peg::to::tclparam, to make the use of
       this highly configurable package easier by providing a canned
       configuration. When applied this configuration causes the package
       pt::peg::to::tclparam to generate snit-based parser packages.

       It is a supporting package in the Core Layer of Parser Tools.

       IMAGE: arch_core_support

API
       ::pt::tclparam::configuration::snit def name cmdprefix
              The command applies the configuration provided by this package to
              the cmdprefix, causing the creation of snit-based parsers whose
              class is name.

              The use of a command prefix as API allows application of the
              configuration to not only pt::peg::to::tclparam
              (pt::peg::to::tclparam configure), but also export manager
              instances and PEG containers ($export configuration set and
              [$container exporter] configuration set respectively).

              Or anything other command prefix accepting two arguments, option
              and value.
