NAME
       ntext - Alternative Bindings for the Text Widget

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tcl  8.5

       package require Tk  8.5

       package require ntext  ?0.81?

DESCRIPTION
       The purpose of the ntext package is to make the text widget behave more
       like other text-editing applications. It makes the text widget more
       useful for implementing a text editor, and makes it behave in a way that
       will be more familiar to most users.

       The package provides a binding tag named Ntext for use by text widgets in
       place of the default Text binding tag.

       Package ntext 's functions and variables are contained entirely in the
       ::ntext namespace; its other code is contained in the binding tag Ntext.
       ntext has no exports to the global or other namespaces, and no new widget
       commands.  It uses modified copies of the Tk code, leaving the original
       code, and the Text binding tag, unchanged.

       The differences between the Ntext binding tag and the default Text
       binding tag are in three categories:

       •      Some Text bindings behave differently from most text-editing
              applications.  Ntext gives these bindings more familiar behaviour.
              For details see ntextBindings.

       •      When a logical line with leading whitespace is word-wrapped onto
              more than one display line, the wrapped display lines begin
              further to the left than the first display line, which can make
              the text layout untidy and difficult to read.  Ntext can indent
              the wrapped lines to match the leading whitespace of the first
              display line (this facility is switched off by default).  For
              details see ntextIndent.

       •      When the user navigates or selects text, Tcl/Tk sometimes needs to
              detect word boundaries.  Ntext provides improved rules for word
              boundary detection.  For details see ntextWordBreak.

       The remainder of this page describes the basic use and configuration of
       all three aspects of Ntext.  For more detailed information on the
       different facilities of Ntext, see the pages ntextBindings, ntextIndent,
       and ntextWordBreak.

       See Section EXAMPLE for how to apply the Ntext binding tag in place of
       the Text binding tag.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       Ntext provides alternatives to a number of behaviours of the classic Text
       binding tag.  Where there is an option, the Ntext behaviour (except for
       display-line indentation) is switched on by default.

       The behaviour of Ntext may be configured application-wide by setting the
       values of a number of namespace variables:

       ::ntext::classicAnchor

       •      0 - (default value) selects Ntext behaviour, i.e. the anchor point
              is fixed

       •      1 - selects classic Text behaviour, i.e. the anchor point is
              variable

       ::ntext::classicExtras

       •      0 - (default value) selects Ntext behaviour, i.e. several
              traditional Text bindings are de-activated

       •      1 - selects classic Text behaviour, i.e. all Text bindings are
              activated

       ::ntext::classicMouseSelect

       •      0 - (default value) selects Ntext behaviour, i.e. the anchor point
              for mouse selection operations is moved by keyboard navigation

       •      1 - selects classic Text behaviour

       ::ntext::classicWordBreak

       •      0 - (default value) selects Ntext behaviour, i.e. platform-
              independent, two classes of word characters and one class of non-
              word characters.

       •      1 - selects classic Text behaviour, i.e. platform-dependent, one
              class of word characters and one class of non-word characters

       •      After changing this value, the matching patterns should be
              recalculated.  See ntextWordBreak for details and advanced
              configuration options.

       ::ntext::classicWrap

       •      0 - selects Ntext behaviour, i.e. display lines of text widgets in
              -wrap word mode are indented to match the initial whitespace of
              the first display line of a logical line.  If the widget already
              holds text when this value is set, a function call may be
              necessary.  See ntextIndent for detailed instructions on the use
              of Ntext 's indentation.

       •      1 - (default value) selects classic Text behaviour, i.e. no
              indentation

       ::ntext::overwrite

       •      0 - (initial value) text typed at the keyboard is inserted into
              the widget

       •      1 - text typed at the keyboard overwrites text already in the
              widget

       •      The value is toggled by the Insert key.

EXAMPLE
       To create a text widget .t and use the Ntext bindings:

       package require ntext
       text .t
       bindtags .t {.t Ntext . all}

       See bindtags for more information.
