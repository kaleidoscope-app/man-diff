SYNOPSIS
       image create bitmap ?name? ?options?

DESCRIPTION
       A bitmap is an image whose pixels can display either of two colors or be
       transparent.  A bitmap image is defined by four things:  a background
       color, a foreground color, and two bitmaps, called the source and the
       mask.  Each of the bitmaps specifies 0/1 values for a rectangular array
       of pixels, and the two bitmaps must have the same dimensions.  For pixels
       where the mask is zero, the image displays nothing, producing a
       transparent effect.  For other pixels, the image displays the foreground
       color if the source data is one and the background color if the source
       data is zero.


CREATING BITMAPS
       Like all images, bitmaps are created using the image create command.
       Bitmaps support the following options:

       -background color
              Specifies a background color for the image in any of the standard
              ways accepted by Tk.  If this option is set to an empty string
              then the background pixels will be transparent.  This effect is
              achieved by using the source bitmap as the mask bitmap, ignoring
              any -maskdata or -maskfile options.

       -data string
              Specifies the contents of the source bitmap as a string.  The
              string must adhere to X11 bitmap format (e.g., as generated by the
              bitmap program).  If both the -data and -file options are
              specified, the -data option takes precedence.

       -file name
              name gives the name of a file whose contents define the source
              bitmap.  The file must adhere to X11 bitmap format (e.g., as
              generated by the bitmap program).

       -foreground color
              Specifies a foreground color for the image in any of the standard
              ways accepted by Tk.

       -maskdata string
              Specifies the contents of the mask as a string.  The string must
              adhere to X11 bitmap format (e.g., as generated by the bitmap
              program).  If both the -maskdata and -maskfile options are
              specified, the -maskdata option takes precedence.

       -maskfile name
              name gives the name of a file whose contents define the mask.  The
              file must adhere to X11 bitmap format (e.g., as generated by the
              bitmap program).


IMAGE COMMAND
       When a bitmap image is created, Tk also creates a new command whose name
       is the same as the image.  This command may be used to invoke various
       operations on the image.  It has the following general form:
              imageName option ?arg arg ...?
       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following commands are possible for bitmap images:

       imageName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the image
              create bitmap command.

       imageName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options for the image.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for imageName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this
              case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have any of
              the values accepted by the image create bitmap command.
