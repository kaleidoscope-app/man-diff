DESCRIPTION
       This command provides runtime debugging output for variables and commands
       without the need to edit your code.  For variables, the underlying
       mechanism uses trace and dump var.  For commands, it renames the observed
       procedure and uses a special wrapper procedure.  WARNING: using this
       procedure after checkpointing state will result in major problems if you
       clean state because the renamed (true) commands will be lost.

       This procedure is experimental.  Comments are encouraged.

       observe command cmdname ?maxlevel?
              This will create a wrapper command which prints out (using dump)
              the call stack to the console.  maxlevel represents the maximum
              number of levels of the call stack which will be printed (defaults
              to 4).

       observe cdelete cmdname
              Removes the wrapper around an observed command.

       observe cinfo cmdname
              Prints out useless info.

       observe variable varname operation ?args?
              Currently a wrapper around trace that uses dump to print out the
              value of the named variable whenever the specified operation on
              that variable occurs (must be read, write or unset).

       observe vdelete varname operation
              Deletes the trace wrapper around the named variable.

       observe vinfo varname
              Prints out trace info about the named variable.
