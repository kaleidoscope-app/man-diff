DESCRIPTION
       Please read Name service facility, introduction first.

       This package is internal and of no interest to users. It provides the
       commands of the name service facility which are shared by the client and
       server implemented by the packages nameserv::server and nameserv (the
       client).

       This service is built in top of and for the package comm.  It has nothing
       to do with the Internet's Domain Name System. If the reader is looking
       for a package dealing with that please see Tcllib's packages dns and
       resolv.

API
       The package exports a single command, as specified below:

       ::nameserv::common::port
              The result returned by the command is the id of the default TCP/IP
              port a nameservice server will listen on, and a name service
              client will try to connect to.
