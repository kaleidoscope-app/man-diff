DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::scrolledhtml command creates a scrolled text widget with
       the additional capability to display html formatted documents.  An import
       method is provided to read an html document file, and a render method is
       provided to display a html formatted text string.


METHODS
       The iwidgets::scrolledhtml command creates a new Tcl command whose name
       is pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on
       the widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following commands are possible for scrolledhtml widgets:

ASSOCIATED METHODS
       bbox            compare        debug           delete
       dlineinfo       get            index           insert
       mark            scan           search          see
       tag             window         xview           yview

       See the "text" manual entry for details on the standard methods.

INHERITED METHODS
       export          clear

       See the "scrolledhtml" manual entry for details on the inherited methods.


WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::scrolledhtml command.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::scrolledhtml command.

       pathName import ?option? href
              Load html formatted text from a file.  Href must exist.  If option
              is -link, href is assumed to be relative to the application's
              current working directory. Otherwise, href is assumed to be
              relative to the path of the last page loaded. Href is either a
              filename, or a reference of the form filename#anchorname. In the
              latter form, fIFilename and/or anchorname may be empty.  If
              filename is empty, the current document is assumed.  If anchorname
              is empty, the top of the document is assumed.

       pathName pwd
              Print the current working directory of the widget, i.e. the
              directory of the last page loaded.

       pathName render htmltext ?wd?
              Display HTML formatted text htmltext. Wd gives the base path to
              use for all links and images in the document. Wd defaults to the
              application's current working directory.

       pathName title
              Return the title of the current page, as given in the
              <title>...</title> field in the document.


HTML COMPLIANCE
       This widget is compliant with HTML 3.2 with the following exceptions:

       No features requiring a connection to an http server are supported.

       Some image alignments aren't supported, because they are not supported by
       the text widget.

       The <br> attributes dealing with image alignments aren't supported.

       Automatic table sizing is not supported very well, due to limitations of
       the text widget

EXAMPLE

               package require Iwidgets 4.0
               option add *textBackground white

               iwidgets::scrolledhtml .sh -fontname helvetica -linkcommand "this import -link"

               pack .sh -padx 10 -pady 10 -fill both -expand yes

               .sh import ~/public_html/index.html


BUGS
              Cells in a table can be caused to overlap. ex:
                  <table border width="100%">
                  <tr><td>cell1</td><td align=right rowspan=2>cell2</td></tr>
                  <tr><td colspan=2>cell3 w/ overlap</td>
                  </table> It hasn't been fixed because 1) it's a pain to fix,
              2) it will slow tables down by a significant amount, and 3)
              netscape has the same bug, as of V3.01.
