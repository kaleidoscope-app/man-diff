DESCRIPTION
       Are you lost ?  Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In
       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to Parser
       Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the current
       package is a part of.

       This package provides a sub-type of pt::peg::container which is preloaded
       with a parsing expression grammar describing a textual format for parsing
       expression grammars.

       The sub-type provides the exact same API as pt::peg::container. Instead
       of duplicating its contents the reader is asked to read the referenced
       document.
