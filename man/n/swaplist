DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a dialog which consists of 2 listboxes, along with
       buttons to move items between them and reorder the right list.

       ::swaplist::swaplist pathName variable completeList selectedList
       ?options?
              Creates a dialog which presents the user with a pair of listboxes.
              Items are selected by using the buttons to move them to the right
              list. The contents of the right list are put in the variable upon
              closure of the dialog.  The command returns a boolean indicating
              if the user pressed OK or not. If -geometry is not specified, the
              dialog is centered in its parent toplevel unless its parent is .
              in which case the dialog is centered in the screen.

              Options:

              -embed if this flag is supplied, the procedure will create a
                     swaplist widget named pathName, with the variable set as
                     the listvariable for the right side listbox. This flag will
                     also cause the -title and -geometry flags to be ignored.

              -reorder
                     boolean specifying if buttons allowing the user to change
                     the order of the right listbox should appear or not.
                     defaults to true

              -title sets the title of the dialog window. defaults to
                     "Configuration"

              -llabel
                     sets the heading above the left list. defaults to
                     "Available:"

              -rlabel
                     sets the heading above the right list. defaults to
                     "Selected:"

              -lbuttontext
                     sets the text on the "move left" button. defaults to "<<"

              -rbuttontext
                     sets the text on the "move right" button. defaults to ">>"

              -ubuttontext
                     sets the text on the "move up" button. defaults to "Move
                     Up"

              -dbuttontext
                     sets the text on the "move down" button. defaults to "Move
                     Down"
