DESCRIPTION
       This document specifies both names and syntax of all the commands which
       together are the docidx markup language, version 1.  As this document is
       intended to be a reference the commands are listed in alphabetical order,
       and the descriptions are relatively short.  A beginner should read the
       much more informally written docidx language introduction first.

COMMANDS
       comment plaintext
              Index markup. The argument text is marked up as a comment standing
              outside of the actual text of the document. Main use is in free-
              form text.

       include filename
              Templating. The contents of the named file are interpreted as text
              written in the docidx markup and processed in the place of the
              include command. The markup in the file has to be self-contained.
              It is not possible for a markup command to cross the file
              boundaries.

       index_begin text title
              Document structure. The command to start an index. The arguments
              are a label for the whole group of documents the index refers to
              (text) and the overall title text for the index (title), without
              markup.

              The label often is the name of the package (or extension) the
              documents belong to.

       index_end
              Document structure. Command to end an index. Anything in the
              document coming after this command is in error.

       key text
              Index structure. This command adds the keyword text to the index.

       lb     Text. The command is replaced with a left bracket. Use in free-
              form text. Required to avoid interpretation of a left bracket as
              the start of a markup command. Its usage is restricted to the
              arguments of other markup commands.

       manpage file text
              Index structure. This command adds an element to the index which
              refers to a document. The document is specified through the
              symbolic name file. The text argument is used to label the
              reference.

              Symbolic names are used to preserve the convertibility of this
              format to any output format. The actual name of the file will be
              inserted by the chosen formatting engine when converting the
              input. This will be based on a mapping from symbolic to actual
              names given to the engine.

       rb     Text. The command is replaced with a right bracket. Use in free-
              form text. Required to avoid interpretation of a right bracket as
              the end of a markup command. Its usage is restricted to the
              arguments of other commands.

       url url label
              Index structure. This is the second command to add an element to
              the index. To refer to a document it is not using a symbolic name
              however, but a (possibly format-specific) url describing the exact
              location of the document indexed here.

       vset varname value
              Templating. In this form the command sets the named document
              variable to the specified value. It does not generate output. I.e.
              the command is replaced by the empty string.

       vset varname
              Templating. In this form the command is replaced by the value of
              the named document variable
