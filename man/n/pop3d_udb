DESCRIPTION
       The package pop3d::udb provides simple in memory databases which can be
       used in conjunction with the pop3 server core provided by the package
       pop3d. The databases will use the names of users as keys and associates
       passwords and storage references with them.

       Objects created by this package can be directly used in the
       authentication callback of pop3 servers following the same interface as
       servers created by the package pop3d.

       ::pop3d::udb::new ?dbName?
              This command creates a new database object with an associated
              global Tcl command whose name is dbName.

       The command dbName may be used to invoke various operations on the
       database.  It has the following general form:

       dbName option ?arg arg ...?
              Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.

       The following commands are possible for database objects:

       dbName destroy
              Destroys the database object.

       dbName add user pwd storage
              Add a new user or changes the data of an existing user. Stores
              password and storage reference for the given user.

       dbName remove user
              Removes the specified user from the database.

       dbName rename user newName
              Changes the name of the specified user to newName.

       dbName lookup user
              Searches the database for the specified user and returns a two-
              element list containing the associated password and storage
              reference, in this order. Throws an error if the user could not be
              found. This is the interface as expected by the authentication
              callback of package pop3d.

       dbName exists user
              Returns true if the specified user is known to the database, else
              false.

       dbName who
              Returns a list of users known to the database.

       dbName save ?file?
              Saves the contents of the database into the given file. If the
              file is not specified the system will use the path last used in a
              call to dbName read. The generated file can be read by the read
              method.

       dbName read file
              Reads the specified file and adds the contained user definitions
              to the database. As the file is actually source'd a safe
              interpreter is employed to safeguard against malicious code. This
              interpreter knows the add command for adding users and their
              associated data to this database. This command has the same
              argument signature as the method add. The path of the file is
              remembered internally so that it can be used in the next call of
              dbName save without an argument.
