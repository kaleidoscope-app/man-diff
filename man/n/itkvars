NAME
       itkvars - variables used by [incr Tk]
________________________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       The following global variables are created and managed automatically by
       the [incr Tk] library.  Except where noted below, these variables should
       normally be treated as read-only by application-specific code and by
       users.

       itk::library
              When an interpreter is created, [incr Tk] initializes this
              variable to hold the name of a directory containing the system
              library of [incr Tk] scripts.  The initial value of itk::library
              is set from the ITK_LIBRARY environment variable if it exists, or
              from a compiled-in value otherwise.

              When [incr Tk] is added to an interpreter, it executes the script
              "init.itk" in this directory.  This script, in turn, looks for
              other script files with the name "init.xxx".  Mega-widget
              libraries will be automatically initialized if they install a
              script named "init.xxx" in this directory, where "xxx" is the name
              of the mega-widget library.  For example, the [incr Widgets]
              library installs the script "init.iwidgets" in this directory.
              This script establishes the "iwidgets" namespace, and sets up
              autoloading for all [incr Widgets] commands.
