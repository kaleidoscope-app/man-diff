DESCRIPTION
       Are you lost ?  Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In
       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to Parser
       Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the current
       package is a part of.

       This package does not exist.  There is no need for it.  The CONTAINER
       format for parsing expression grammars is a piece of Tcl code which, then
       sourced, provides a class whose instances have the grammar we wish to
       import loaded.  Another way of looking at this is, the CONTAINER output
       is its own import package.

BUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK
       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain
       bugs and other problems.  Please report such in the category pt of the

       Please also report any ideas for enhancements you may have for either
       package and/or documentation.
