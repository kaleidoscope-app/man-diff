DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::disjointlistbox command creates a disjoint pair of listboxs
       similar to the OSF/Motif "Book" printing dialog of the "FrameMaker"
       program.  It is implementation constists of a two Scrolledlistboxs, 2
       buttons, and 2 labels.

       The disjoint behavior of this widget exists between the interaction of
       the two Scrolledlistboxes with one another.  That is, a given instance of
       a Disjointlistbox will never exist, without the aid of a hack magician,
       which has Scrolledlistbox widgets with items in common.  That means the
       relationship between the two is maintained similar to that of disjoint
       sets.

       Users may transfer items between the two Listbox widgets using the the
       two buttons.

       Options exists which include the ability to configure the "items"
       displayed by the 2 Scrolledlistboxes and to control the placement of the
       insertion and removal buttons.

METHODS
       The iwidgets::disjointlistbox command creates a new Tcl command whose
       name is pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations
       on the widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following commands are possible for disjointlistbox widgets:


WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::disjointlistbox command.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::disjointlistbox
              command.

       pathName setlhs
              Set the current contents of the left-most Scrolledlistbox with the
              input list of items.  Removes all (if any) items from the right-
              most Scrolledlistbox which exist in the input list option to
              maintain the disjoint property between the two

       pathName setrhs
              Set the current contents of the right-most Scrolledlistbox with
              the input list of items.  Removes all (if any) items from the
              left-most Scrolledlistbox which exist in the input list option to
              maintain the disjoint property between the two

       pathName getlhs
              Returns the current contents of the left-most Scrolledlistbox

       pathName getrhs
              Returns the current contents of the right-most Scrolledlistbox

       pathName insertlhs
              Add the input list of items to the current contents of the left-
              most Scrolledlistbox.  Removes all (if any) items from the right-
              most Scrolledlistbox which exist in the input list option to
              maintain the disjoint property between the two

       pathName insertrhs
              Add the input list of items to the current contents of the right-
              most Scrolledlistbox.  Removes all (if any) items from the left-
              most Scrolledlistbox which exist in the input list option to
              maintain the disjoint property between the two.

       Name:           lhsCount
       Class:          Label

              The lhsCount component is the label for displaying a count of the
              current items in the Scrolledlistbox.  See the "Label" widget
              manual entry for details  on the lhsCount label component.

       Name:           rhsCount
       Class:          Label
