DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a widget to enable the user of a map display to
       control the zoom level.

API
       ::canvas::zoom pathName ?options?
              Creates the zoom control widget pathName and configures it. The
              methods and options supported by the new widget are described in
              the following sections.

              The result of the command is pathName.

   OPTIONS
       -orient
              The value for this option is either vertical, or horizontal,
              specifying the orientation of the major axis of the widget. The
              default is vertical.

       -levels
              The value for this option is a non-negative integer. It specifies
              the number of zoom levels to support.

       -variable
              The value for this option is the name of a global or namespaced
              variable which is connected with the widget. changes to the zoom
              level made the widget are propagated to this variable, and in turn
              changes to the variable are imported into the widget.

       -command
              This option specifies a command prefix. This callback will be
              invoked whenever the zoom level is changed. It is called with two
              additional arguments, the zoom control widget, and the new zoom
              level, in this order.

   METHODS
       The widget supports no methods beyond the standard (configure, cget,
       etc.).
