NAME
       tk - Manipulate Tk internal state

SYNOPSIS
       tk option ?arg arg ...?
________________________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       The tk command provides access to miscellaneous elements of Tk's internal
       state.  Most of the information manipulated by this command pertains to
       the application as a whole, or to a screen or display, rather than to a
       particular window.  The command can take any of a number of different
       forms depending on the option argument.  The legal forms are:

       tk appname ?newName?
              If newName is not specified, this command returns the name of the
              application (the name that may be used in send commands to
              communicate with the application).  If newName is specified, then
              the name of the application is changed to newName.  If the given
              name is already in use, then a suffix of the form “ #2” or “ #3”
              is appended in order to make the name unique.  The command's
              result is the name actually chosen.  newName should not start with
              a capital letter.  This will interfere with option processing,
              since names starting with capitals are assumed to be classes;  as
              a result, Tk may not be able to find some options for the
              application.  If sends have been disabled by deleting the send
              command, this command will reenable them and recreate the send
              command.

       tk caret window ?-x x? ?-y y? ?-height height?
              Sets and queries the caret location for the display of the
              specified Tk window window.  The caret is the per-display cursor
              location used for indicating global focus (e.g. to comply with
              Microsoft Accessibility guidelines), as well as for location of
              the over-the-spot XIM (X Input Methods) or Windows IME windows.
              If no options are specified, the last values used for setting the
              caret are return in option-value pair format.  -x and -y represent
              window-relative coordinates, and -height is the height of the
              current cursor location, or the height of the specified window if
              none is given.

       tk scaling ?-displayof window? ?number?
              Sets and queries the current scaling factor used by Tk to convert
              between physical units (for example, points, inches, or
              millimeters) and pixels.  The number argument is a floating point
              number that specifies the number of pixels per point on window's
              display.  If the window argument is omitted, it defaults to the
              main window.  If the number argument is omitted, the current value
              of the scaling factor is returned.

              A “point” is a unit of measurement equal to 1/72 inch.  A scaling
              factor of 1.0 corresponds to 1 pixel per point, which is
              equivalent to a standard 72 dpi monitor.  A scaling factor of 1.25
              would mean 1.25 pixels per point, which is the setting for a 90
              dpi monitor; setting the scaling factor to 1.25 on a 72 dpi
              monitor would cause everything in the application to be displayed
              1.25 times as large as normal.  The initial value for the scaling
              factor is set when the application starts, based on properties of
              the installed monitor, but it can be changed at any time.
              Measurements made after the scaling factor is changed will use the
              new scaling factor, but it is undefined whether existing widgets
              will resize themselves dynamically to accommodate the new scaling
              factor.

       tk inactive ?-displayof window? ?reset?
              Returns a positive integer, the number of milliseconds since the
              last time the user interacted with the system. If the -displayof
              option is given then the return value refers to the display of
              window; otherwise it refers to the display of the application's
              main window.

              tk inactive will return -1, if querying the user inactive time is
              not supported by the system, and in safe interpreters.

              If the literal string reset is given as an additional argument,
              the timer is reset and an empty string is returned. Resetting the
              inactivity time is forbidden in safe interpreters and will throw
              and error if tried.

       tk useinputmethods ?-displayof window? ?boolean?
              Sets and queries the state of whether Tk should use XIM (X Input
              Methods) for filtering events.  The resulting state is returned.
              XIM is used in some locales (i.e., Japanese, Korean), to handle
              special input devices. This feature is only significant on X.  If
              XIM support is not available, this will always return 0.  If the
              window argument is omitted, it defaults to the main window.  If
              the boolean argument is omitted, the current state is returned.
              This is turned on by default for the main display.

       tk windowingsystem
              Returns the current Tk windowing system, one of x11 (X11-based),
              win32 (MS Windows), or aqua (Mac OS X Aqua).
