DESCRIPTION
       This package provides commands to query and modify PNG images. PNG stands
       for Portable Network Graphics and is specified at
       http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2.

COMMANDS
       ::png::validate file
              Returns a value indicating if file is a valid PNG file. The file
              is checked for PNG signature, each chunks checksum is verified,
              existence of a data chunk is verified, first chunk is checked for
              header, last chunk is checked for ending. Things not checked for
              are: validity of values within a chunk, multiple header chunks,
              noncontiguous data chunks, end chunk before actual eof. This
              procedure can take lots of time.

              Possible return values:

              OK     File is a valid PNG file.

              SIG    no/broken PNG signature.

              BADLEN corrupt chunk length.

              EOF    premature end of file.

              NOHDR  missing header chunk.

              CKSUM  crc mismatch.

              NODATA missing data chunk(s).

              NOEND  missing end marker.

       ::png::isPNG file
              Returns a boolean value indicating if the file file starts with a
              PNG signature. This is a much faster and less intensive check than
              ::png::validate as it does not check if the PNG data is valid.

       ::png::imageInfo file
              Returns a dictionary with keys width, height, depth, color,
              compression, filter, and interlace. The values are the associated
              properties of the PNG image in file.  Throws an error if file is
              not a PNG image, or if the checksum of the header is invalid. For
              information on interpreting the values for the returned properties
              see http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Chunks.html.

       ::png::getTimestamp file
              Returns the epoch time if a timestamp chunk is found in the PNG
              image contained in the file, otherwise returns the empty string.
              Does not attempt to verify the checksum of the timestamp chunk.
              Throws an error if the file is not a valid PNG image.

       ::png::setTimestamp file time
              Writes a new timestamp to the file, either replacing the old
              timestamp, or adding one just before the data chunks if there was
              no previous timestamp. time is the new time in the gmt epoch
              format.  Throws an error if file is not a valid PNG image.

       ::png::getComments file
              Currently supports only uncompressed comments. Does not attempt to
              verify the checksums of the comment chunks. Returns a list where
              each element is a comment. Each comment is itself a list. The list
              for a plain text comment consists of 2 elements: the human
              readable keyword, and the text data. A unicode (international)
              comment consists of 4 elements: the human readable keyword, the
              language identifier, the translated keyword, and the unicode text
              data.  Throws an error if file is not a valid PNG image.

       ::png::removeComments file
              Removes all comments from the PNG image in file. Beware - This
              uses memory equal to the file size minus comments, to hold the
              intermediate result.  Throws an error if file is not a valid PNG
              image.

       ::png::addComment file keyword text
              Adds a plain text comment to the PNG image in file, just before
              the first data chunk. Will throw an error if no data chunk is
              found. keyword has to be less than 80 characters long to conform
              to the PNG specification.

       ::png::addComment file keyword lang keyword2 text
              Adds a unicode (international) comment to the PNG image in file,
              just before the first data chunk. Will throw an error if no data
              chunk is found. keyword has to be less than 80 characters long to
              conform to the PNG specification. keyword2 is the translated
              keyword, in the language specified by the language identifier
              lang.
