DESCRIPTION
       Are you lost ?  Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In
       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to Parser
       Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the current
       package is a part of.

       This package provides commands to work with the serializations of parsing
       expression grammars as managed by the Parser Tools, and specified in
       section PEG serialization format.

       This is a supporting package in the Core Layer of Parser Tools.

       ::pt::peg verify serial ?canonvar?
              This command verifies that the content of serial is a valid
              serialization of a parsing expression and will throw an error if
              that is not the case. The result of the command is the empty
              string.

              If the argument canonvar is specified it is interpreted as the
              name of a variable in the calling context. This variable will be
              written to if and only if serial is a valid regular serialization.
              Its value will be a boolean, with True indicating that the
              serialization is not only valid, but also canonical. False will be
              written for a valid, but non-canonical serialization.

              For the specification of serializations see the section PE
              serialization format.

       ::pt::peg verify-as-canonical serial
              This command verifies that the content of serial is a valid
              canonical serialization of a PEG and will throw an error if that
              is not the case. The result of the command is the empty string.

              For the specification of canonical serializations see the section
              PEG serialization format.

       ::pt::peg canonicalize serial
              This command assumes that the content of serial is a valid regular
              serialization of a PEG and will throw an error if that is not the
              case.

              It will then convert the input into the canonical serialization of
              the contained PEG and return it as its result. If the input is
              already canonical it will be returned unchanged.

              For the specification of regular and canonical serializations see
              the section PEG serialization format.

       ::pt::peg print serial
              This command assumes that the argument serial contains a valid
              serialization of a parsing expression and returns a string
              containing that PE in a human readable form.

              The exact format of this form is not specified and cannot be
              relied on for parsing or other machine-based activities.

              For the specification of serializations see the section PEG
              serialization format.

       ::pt::peg merge seriala serialb
              This command accepts the regular serializations of two grammars
              and uses them to create their union.  The result of the command is
              the canonical serialization of this unified grammar.

              A merge errors occurs if for any nonterminal symbol S occuring in
              both input grammars the two input grammars specify different
              semantic modes.

              The semantic mode of each nonterminal symbol S is the semantic
              mode of S in any of its input grammars. The previous rule made
              sure that for symbols occuring in both grammars these values are
              identical.

              The right-hand side of each nonterminal symbol S occuring in both
              input grammars is the choice between the right-hand sides of S in
              the input grammars, with the parsing expression of S in seriala
              coming first, except if both expressions are identical. In that
              case the first expression is taken.

              The right-hand side of each nonterminal symbol S occuring in only
              one of the input grammars is the right-hand side of S in its input
              grammar.

              The start expression of the unified grammar is the choice between
              the start expressions of the input grammars, with the start
              expression of seriala coming first, except if both expressions are
              identical.  In that case the first expression is taken

       ::pt::peg equal seriala serialb
              This command tests the two grammars seriala and serialb for
              structural equality. The result of the command is a boolean value.
              It will be set to true if the expressions are identical, and false
              otherwise.

              String equality is usable only if we can assume that the two
              grammars are pure Tcl lists and dictionaries.

PEG SERIALIZATION FORMAT
       Here we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize Parsing
       Expression Grammars as immutable values for transport, comparison, etc.

       We distinguish between regular and canonical serializations.  While a PEG
       may have more than one regular serialization only exactly one of them
       will be canonical.

       regular serialization

              [1]    The serialization of any PEG is a nested Tcl dictionary.

              [2]    This dictionary holds a single key, pt::grammar::peg, and
                     its value. This value holds the contents of the grammar.

              [3]    The contents of the grammar are a Tcl dictionary holding
                     the set of nonterminal symbols and the starting expression.
                     The relevant keys and their values are

                     rules  The value is a Tcl dictionary whose keys are the
                            names of the nonterminal symbols known to the
                            grammar.

                            [1]    Each nonterminal symbol may occur only once.

                            [2]    The empty string is not a legal nonterminal
                                   symbol.

                            [3]    The value for each symbol is a Tcl dictionary
                                   itself. The relevant keys and their values in
                                   this dictionary are

                                   is     The value is the serialization of the
                                          parsing expression describing the
                                          symbols sentennial structure, as
                                          specified in the section PE
                                          serialization format.

                                   mode   The value can be one of three values
                                          specifying how a parser should handle
                                          the semantic value produced by the
                                          symbol.

                                          value  The semantic value of the
                                                 nonterminal symbol is an
                                                 abstract syntax tree consisting
                                                 of a single node node for the
                                                 nonterminal itself, which has
                                                 the ASTs of the symbol's right
                                                 hand side as its children.

                                          leaf   The semantic value of the
                                                 nonterminal symbol is an
                                                 abstract syntax tree consisting
                                                 of a single node node for the
                                                 nonterminal, without any
                                                 children. Any ASTs generated by
                                                 the symbol's right hand side
                                                 are discarded.

                                          void   The nonterminal has no semantic
                                                 value. Any ASTs generated by
                                                 the symbol's right hand side
                                                 are discarded (as well).

                     start  The value is the serialization of the start parsing
                            expression of the grammar, as specified in the
                            section PE serialization format.

              [4]    The terminal symbols of the grammar are specified
                     implicitly as the set of all terminal symbols used in the
                     start expression and on the RHS of the grammar rules.

       canonical serialization
              The canonical serialization of a grammar has the format as
              specified in the previous item, and then additionally satisfies
              the constraints below, which make it unique among all the possible
              serializations of this grammar.

              [1]    The keys found in all the nested Tcl dictionaries are
                     sorted in ascending dictionary order, as generated by Tcl's
                     builtin command lsort -increasing -dict.

              [2]    The string representation of the value is the canonical
                     representation of a Tcl dictionary. I.e. it does not
                     contain superfluous whitespace.

   EXAMPLE
       Assuming the following PEG for simple mathematical expressions


       PEG calculator (Expression)
           Digit      <- '0'/'1'/'2'/'3'/'4'/'5'/'6'/'7'/'8'/'9'   ;
           Sign       <- '-' / '+'                       ;
           Number     <- Sign? Digit+                         ;
           Expression <- '(' Expression ')' / (Factor (MulOp Factor)*)  ;
           MulOp      <- '*' / '/'                       ;
           Factor     <- Term (AddOp Term)*                   ;
           AddOp      <- '+'/'-'                         ;
           Term       <- Number                     ;
       END;


       then its canonical serialization (except for whitespace) is


       pt::grammar::peg {
           rules {
            AddOp      {is {/ {t -} {t +}}                                                                mode value}

            Expression {is {/ {x {t (} {n Expression} {t )}} {x {n Factor} {* {x {n MulOp} {n Factor}}}}} mode value}
            Factor     {is {x {n Term} {* {x {n AddOp} {n Term}}}}                                        mode value}
            MulOp      {is {/ {t *} {t /}}                                                                mode value}
            Number     {is {x {? {n Sign}} {+ {n Digit}}}                                                 mode value}
            Sign       {is {/ {t -} {t +}}                                                                mode value}
            Term       {is  {n Number}                                                                    mode value}
           }
           start {n Expression}
       }


PE SERIALIZATION FORMAT
       Here we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize Parsing
       Expressions as immutable values for transport, comparison, etc.

       We distinguish between regular and canonical serializations.  While a
       parsing expression may have more than one regular serialization only
       exactly one of them will be canonical.

                            a custom extension of PEs based on Tcl's builtin
                            command string is.

                     [16]   The string ddigit is an atomic parsing expression.
                            It matches any decimal digit character. This is a
                            custom extension of PEs based on Tcl's builtin
                            command regexp.

                     [17]   The expression [list t x] is an atomic parsing
                            expression. It matches the terminal string x.

                     [18]   The expression [list n A] is an atomic parsing
                            expression. It matches the nonterminal A.

              Combined Parsing Expressions

                     [1]    For parsing expressions e1, e2, ... the result of
                            [list / e1 e2 ... ] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the ordered choice, aka prioritized choice.

                     [2]    For parsing expressions e1, e2, ... the result of
                            [list x e1 e2 ... ] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the sequence.

                     [3]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list * e]
                            is a parsing expression as well.  This is the kleene
                            closure, describing zero or more repetitions.

                     [4]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list + e]
                            is a parsing expression as well.  This is the
                            positive kleene closure, describing one or more
                            repetitions.

                     [5]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list & e]
                            is a parsing expression as well.  This is the and
                            lookahead predicate.

                     [6]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list ! e]
                            is a parsing expression as well.  This is the not
                            lookahead predicate.

                     [7]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list ? e]
                            is a parsing expression as well.  This is the
                            optional input.

       Canonical serialization
              The canonical serialization of a parsing expression has the format
              as specified in the previous item, and then additionally satisfies
              the constraints below, which make it unique among all the possible
              serializations of this parsing expression.

              [1]    The string representation of the value is the canonical
                     representation of a pure Tcl list. I.e. it does not contain
                     superfluous whitespace.

              [2]    Terminals are not encoded as ranges (where start and end of
                     the range are identical).

   EXAMPLE
       Assuming the parsing expression shown on the right-hand side of the rule


           Expression <- '(' Expression ')'
                       / Factor (MulOp Factor)*


       then its canonical serialization (except for whitespace) is


           {/ {x {t (} {n Expression} {t )}} {x {n Factor} {* {x {n MulOp} {n Factor}}}}}
