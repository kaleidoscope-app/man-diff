NAME
       doctoc_lang_syntax - doctoc language syntax

DESCRIPTION
       This document contains the formal specification of the syntax of the
       doctoc markup language, version 1.1 in Backus-Naur-Form. This document is
       intended to be a reference, complementing the doctoc language command
       reference.  A beginner should read the much more informally written
       doctoc language introduction first before trying to understand either
       this document or the command reference.

FUNDAMENTALS
       In the broadest terms possible the doctoc markup language is like SGML
       and similar languages. A document written in this language consists
       primarily of markup commands, with text embedded into it at some places.

       Each markup command is a just Tcl command surrounded by a matching pair
       of [ and ]. Which commands are available, and their arguments, i.e.
       syntax is specified in the doctoc language command reference.

       In this document we specify first the lexeme, and then the syntax, i.e.
       how we can mix text and markup commands with each other.

LEXICAL DEFINITIONS
       In the syntax rules listed in the next section

       [1]    <TEXT> stands for all text except markup commands.

       [2]    Any XXX stands for the markup command [xxx] including its
              arguments. Each markup command is a Tcl command surrounded by a
              matching pair of [ and ]. Inside of these delimiters the usual
              rules for a Tcl command apply with regard to word quotation,
              nested commands, continuation lines, etc.

       [3]    <WHITE> stands for all text consisting only of spaces, newlines,
              tabulators and the comment markup command.

SYNTAX
       The rules listed here specify only the syntax of doctoc documents. The
       lexical level of the language was covered in the previous section.

       Regarding the syntax of the (E)BNF itself

       [1]    The construct { X } stands for zero or more occurrences of X.

       [2]    The construct [ X ] stands for zero or one occurrence of X.

       The syntax:

       toc       = defs
                   TOC_BEGIN
                   contents
                   TOC_END
                   { <WHITE> }

       defs      = { INCLUDE | VSET | <WHITE> }
       contents  = { defs entry } [ defs ]

       entry     = ITEM | division

       division  = DIVISION_START
                   contents
                   DIVISION_END
