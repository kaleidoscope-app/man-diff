DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a command which wraps around the client side of the
       ftp protocol provided by package ftp to allow the retrieval of urls using
       the ftp schema.

API
       ::ftp::geturl url
              This command can be used by the generic command ::uri::geturl (See
              package uri) to retrieve the contents of ftp urls. Internally it
              uses the commands of the package ftp to fulfill the request.

              The contents of a ftp url are defined as follows:

              file   The contents of the specified file itself.

              directory
                     A listing of the contents of the directory in key value
                     notation where the file name is the key and its attributes
                     the associated value.

              link   The attributes of the link, including the path it refers
                     to.
