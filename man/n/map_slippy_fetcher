DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a class for accessing http servers providing tiles
       for slippy-based maps.

API
       ::map::slippy::fetcher fetcherName levels url
              Creates the fetcher fetcherName and configures it with the number
              of zoom levels supported by the tile server, and the url it is
              listening on for tile requests.

              The result of the command is fetcherName.

   METHODS
       fetcherName levels
              This method returns the number of zoom levels supported by the
              fetcher object, and the tile server it is accessing.

       fetcherName tileheight
              This method returns the height of tiles served, in pixels.

       fetcherName tilewidth
              This method returns the width of tiles served, in pixels.

       fetcherName get tile donecmd
              This is the main method of the fetcher, retrieving the image for
              the specified tile. The tile identifier is a list containing three
              elements, the zoom level, row, and column number of the tile, in
              this order.

              The command refix donecmd will be invoked when the fetcher either
              knows the image for the tile or that no image will forthcoming.
              It will be invoked with either 2 or 3 arguments, i.e.

              [1]    The string set, the tile, and the image.

              [2]    The string unset, and the tile.
       These two possibilities are used to either signal the image for the tile,
       or that the tile has no image defined for it.
