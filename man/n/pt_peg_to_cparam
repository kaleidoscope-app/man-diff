DESCRIPTION
       Are you lost ?  Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In
       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to Parser
       Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the current
       package is a part of.

       This package implements the converter from parsing expression grammars to
       CPARAM markup.

       It resides in the Export section of the Core Layer of Parser Tools, and
       can be used either directly with the other packages of this layer, or
       indirectly through the export manager provided by pt::peg::export. The
       latter is intented for use in untrusted environments and done through the
       corresponding export plugin pt::peg::export::cparam sitting between
       converter and export manager.

API
       The API provided by this package satisfies the specification of the
       Converter API found in the Parser Tools Export API specification.

       pt::peg::to::cparam reset
              This command resets the configuration of the package to its
              default settings.

       pt::peg::to::cparam configure
              This command returns a dictionary containing the current
              configuration of the package.

       pt::peg::to::cparam configure option
              This command returns the current value of the specified
              configuration option of the package. For the set of legal options,
              please read the section Options.

       pt::peg::to::cparam configure option value...
              This command sets the given configuration options of the package,
              to the specified values. For the set of legal options, please read
              the section Options.

       pt::peg::to::cparam convert serial
              This command takes the canonical serialization of a parsing
              expression grammar, as specified in section PEG serialization
              format, and contained in serial, and generates CPARAM markup
              encoding the grammar, per the current package configuration.  The
              created string is then returned as the result of the command.

OPTIONS
       The converter to C code recognizes the following configuration variables
       and changes its behaviour as they specify.

       -file string
              The value of this option is the name of the file or other entity
              from which the grammar came, for which the command is run. The
              default value is unknown.

       -name string
              The value of this option is the name of the grammar we are
              processing.  The default value is a_pe_grammar.

       -user string
              The value of this option is the name of the user for which the
              command is run. The default value is unknown.

       -template string
              The value of this option is a string into which to put the
              generated text and the other configuration settings. The various
              locations for user-data are expected to be specified with the
              placeholders listed below. The default value is "@code@".

              @user@ To be replaced with the value of the option -user.

              @format@
                     To be replaced with the the constant C/PARAM.

              @file@ To be replaced with the value of the option -file.

              @name@ To be replaced with the value of the option -name.

              @code@ To be replaced with the generated Tcl code.
       The following options are special, in that they will occur within the
       generated code, and are replaced there as well.

              @statedecl@
                     To be replaced with the value of the option state-decl.

              @stateref@
                     To be replaced with the value of the option state-ref.

              @strings@
                     To be replaced with the value of the option string-varname.

              @self@ To be replaced with the value of the option self-command.

              @def@  To be replaced with the value of the option fun-qualifier.

              @ns@   To be replaced with the value of the option namespace.

              @main@ To be replaced with the value of the option main.

              @prelude@
                     To be replaced with the value of the option prelude.

       -state-decl string
              A C string representing the argument declaration to use in the
              generated parsing functions to refer to the parsing state. In
              essence type and argument name.  The default value is the string
              RDE_PARAM p.

       -state-ref string
              A C string representing the argument named used in the generated
              parsing functions to refer to the parsing state.  The default
              value is the string p.

       -self-command string
              A C string representing the reference needed to call the generated
              parser function (methods ...) from another parser fonction, per
              the chosen framework (template).  The default value is the empty
              string.

       -fun-qualifier string
              A C string containing the attributes to give to the generated
              functions (methods ...), per the chosen framework (template).  The
              default value is static.

       -namespace string
              The name of the C namespace the parser functions (methods, ...)
              shall reside in, or a general prefix to add to the function names.
              The default value is the empty string.

       -main string
              The name of the main function (method, ...) to be called by the
              chosen framework (template) to start parsing input.  The default
              value is __main.

       -string-varname string
              The name of the variable used for the table of strings used by the
              generated parser, i.e. error messages, symbol names, etc.  The
              default value is p_string.

       -prelude string
              A snippet of code to be inserted at the head of each generated
              parsing function.  The default value is the empty string.

       -indent integer
              The number of characters to indent each line of the generated code
              by.  The default value is 0.

       While the high parameterizability of this converter, as shown by the
       multitude of options it supports, is an advantage to the advanced user,
       allowing her to customize the output of the converter as needed, a novice
       user will likely not see the forest for the trees.

       To help these latter users an adjunct package is provided, containing a
       canned configuration which will generate immediately useful full parsers.
       It is

       pt::cparam::configuration::critcl
              Generated parsers are embedded into a Critcl-based framework.

C/PARAM CODE REPRESENTATION OF PARSING EXPRESSION GRAMMARS
       The c format is executable code, a parser for the grammar. The parser
       implementation is written in C and can be tweaked to the users' needs
       through a multitude of options.

       The critcl format, for example, is implemented as a canned configuration
       of these options on top of the generator for c.

       The bulk of such a framework has to be specified through the option
       -template. The additional options

       -fun-qualifier string

       -indent integer

       -main string

       -namespace string

       -prelude string

       -self-command string

       -state-decl string

       -state-ref string

       -string-varname string

       provide code snippets which help to glue framework and generated code
       together. Their placeholders are in the generated code.

   EXAMPLE
       We are forgoing an example of this representation, with apologies.  It
       would be way to large for this document.

PEG SERIALIZATION FORMAT
       Here we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize Parsing
       Expression Grammars as immutable values for transport, comparison, etc.

       We distinguish between regular and canonical serializations.  While a PEG
       may have more than one regular serialization only exactly one of them
       will be canonical.

       regular serialization

              [1]    The serialization of any PEG is a nested Tcl dictionary.

              [2]    This dictionary holds a single key, pt::grammar::peg, and
                     its value. This value holds the contents of the grammar.

              [3]    The contents of the grammar are a Tcl dictionary holding
                     the set of nonterminal symbols and the starting expression.
                     The relevant keys and their values are

                     rules  The value is a Tcl dictionary whose keys are the
                            names of the nonterminal symbols known to the
                            grammar.

                            [1]    Each nonterminal symbol may occur only once.

                            [2]    The empty string is not a legal nonterminal
                                   symbol.

                            [3]    The value for each symbol is a Tcl dictionary
                                   itself. The relevant keys and their values in
                                   this dictionary are

                                   is     The value is the serialization of the
                                          parsing expression describing the
                                          symbols sentennial structure, as
                                          specified in the section PE
                                          serialization format.

                                   mode   The value can be one of three values
                                          specifying how a parser should handle
                                          the semantic value produced by the
                                          symbol.

                                          value  The semantic value of the
                                                 nonterminal symbol is an
                                                 abstract syntax tree consisting
                                                 of a single node node for the
                                                 nonterminal itself, which has
                                                 the ASTs of the symbol's right
                                                 hand side as its children.

                                          leaf   The semantic value of the
                                                 nonterminal symbol is an
                                                 abstract syntax tree consisting
                                                 of a single node node for the
                                                 nonterminal, without any
                                                 children. Any ASTs generated by
                                                 the symbol's right hand side
                                                 are discarded.

                                          void   The nonterminal has no semantic
                                                 value. Any ASTs generated by
                                                 the symbol's right hand side
                                                 are discarded (as well).

                     start  The value is the serialization of the start parsing
                            expression of the grammar, as specified in the
                            section PE serialization format.

              [4]    The terminal symbols of the grammar are specified
                     implicitly as the set of all terminal symbols used in the
                     start expression and on the RHS of the grammar rules.

       canonical serialization
              The canonical serialization of a grammar has the format as
              specified in the previous item, and then additionally satisfies
              the constraints below, which make it unique among all the possible
              serializations of this grammar.

              [1]    The keys found in all the nested Tcl dictionaries are
                     sorted in ascending dictionary order, as generated by Tcl's
                     builtin command lsort -increasing -dict.

              [2]    The string representation of the value is the canonical
                     representation of a Tcl dictionary. I.e. it does not
                     contain superfluous whitespace.

   EXAMPLE
       Assuming the following PEG for simple mathematical expressions


       PEG calculator (Expression)
           Digit      <- '0'/'1'/'2'/'3'/'4'/'5'/'6'/'7'/'8'/'9'   ;
           Sign       <- '-' / '+'                       ;
           Number     <- Sign? Digit+                         ;
           Expression <- '(' Expression ')' / (Factor (MulOp Factor)*)  ;
           MulOp      <- '*' / '/'                       ;
           Factor     <- Term (AddOp Term)*                   ;
           AddOp      <- '+'/'-'                         ;
           Term       <- Number                     ;
       END;


       then its canonical serialization (except for whitespace) is


       pt::grammar::peg {
           rules {
            AddOp      {is {/ {t -} {t +}}                                                                mode value}
            Digit      {is {/ {t 0} {t 1} {t 2} {t 3} {t 4} {t 5} {t 6} {t 7} {t 8} {t 9}}                mode value}
            Expression {is {/ {x {t (} {n Expression} {t )}} {x {n Factor} {* {x {n MulOp} {n Factor}}}}} mode value}
            Factor     {is {x {n Term} {* {x {n AddOp} {n Term}}}}                                        mode value}
            MulOp      {is {/ {t *} {t /}}                                                                mode value}
            Number     {is {x {? {n Sign}} {+ {n Digit}}}                                                 mode value}
            Sign       {is {/ {t -} {t +}}                                                                mode value}
            Term       {is  {n Number}                                                                    mode value}
           }
           start {n Expression}
       }


PE SERIALIZATION FORMAT
       Here we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize Parsing
       Expressions as immutable values for transport, comparison, etc.

       We distinguish between regular and canonical serializations.  While a
       parsing expression may have more than one regular serialization only
       exactly one of them will be canonical.

              Atomic Parsing Expressions

                     [1]    The string epsilon is an atomic parsing expression.
                            It matches the empty string.

                     [2]    The string dot is an atomic parsing expression. It
                            matches any character.

                            matches any Unicode alphabet or digit character.
                            This is a custom extension of PEs based on Tcl's
                            builtin command string is.

                     [4]    The string alpha is an atomic parsing expression. It

              Combined Parsing Expressions

                     [1]    For parsing expressions e1, e2, ... the result of
                            [list / e1 e2 ... ] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the ordered choice, aka prioritized choice.

                     [2]    For parsing expressions e1, e2, ... the result of
                            [list x e1 e2 ... ] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the sequence.

                     [3]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list * e]
                            is a parsing expression as well.  This is the kleene
                            closure, describing zero or more repetitions.

                     [4]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list + e]
                            is a parsing expression as well.  This is the
                            positive kleene closure, describing one or more
                            repetitions.

                     [5]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list & e]
                            is a parsing expression as well.  This is the and
                            lookahead predicate.

                     [6]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list ! e]
                            is a parsing expression as well.  This is the not
                            lookahead predicate.

                     [7]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list ? e]
                            is a parsing expression as well.  This is the
                            optional input.

       Canonical serialization
              The canonical serialization of a parsing expression has the format
              as specified in the previous item, and then additionally satisfies
              the constraints below, which make it unique among all the possible
              serializations of this parsing expression.

              [1]    The string representation of the value is the canonical
                     representation of a pure Tcl list. I.e. it does not contain
                     superfluous whitespace.

              [2]    Terminals are not encoded as ranges (where start and end of
                     the range are identical).

   EXAMPLE
       Assuming the parsing expression shown on the right-hand side of the rule


           Expression <- '(' Expression ')'
                       / Factor (MulOp Factor)*


       then its canonical serialization (except for whitespace) is


           {/ {x {t (} {n Expression} {t )}} {x {n Factor} {* {x {n MulOp} {n Factor}}}}}
