NAME
       bell - Ring a display's bell

SYNOPSIS
       bell ?-displayof window? ?-nice?
________________________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       This command rings the bell on the display for window and returns an
       empty string.  If the -displayof option is omitted, the display of the
       application's main window is used by default.  The command uses the
       current bell-related settings for the display, which may be modified with
       programs such as xset.

       If -nice is not specified, this command also resets the screen saver for
       the screen.  Some screen savers will ignore this, but others will reset
       so that the screen becomes visible again.
