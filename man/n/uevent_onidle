DESCRIPTION
       This package provides objects which can merge multiple requestes for an
       action and execute the action the moment the system (event loop) becomes
       idle. The action to be run is configured during object construction.

API
       The package exports a class, uevent::onidle, as specified below.

       ::uevent::onidle objectName commandprefix
              The command creates a new onidle object with an associated global
              Tcl command whose name is objectName.  This command may be used to
              invoke various operations on the object.

              The commandprefix is the action to perform when the event loop is
              idle and the user asked for it using the method request (See
              below).

       The object commands created by the class commands above have the form:

       objectName request
              This method requests the execution of the command prefix specified
              during the construction of objectName the next time the event loop
              is idle. Multiple requests are merged and cause only one execution
              of the command prefix.

EXAMPLES
       Examples of this type of deferal are buried in the (C-level)
       implementations all the Tk widgets, defering geometry calculations and
       window redraw activity in this manner.
