ARGUMENTS
       The following arguments are accepted by the projection commands:

       lambda Longitude of the point to be projected, in degrees.

       phi    Latitude of the point to be projected, in degrees.

       lambda_0
              Longitude of the center of the sheet, in degrees.  For many
              projections, this figure is also the reference meridian of the
              projection.

       phi_0  Latitude of the center of the sheet, in degrees.  For the
              azimuthal projections, this figure is also the latitude of the
              center of the projection.

       phi_1  Latitude of the first reference parallel, for projections that use
              reference parallels.

       phi_2  Latitude of the second reference parallel, for projections that
              use reference parallels.

       x      X co-ordinate of a point on the map, in units of Earth radii.

       y      Y co-ordinate of a point on the map, in units of Earth radii.

RESULTS
       For all of the procedures whose names begin with 'to', the return value
       is a list comprising an x co-ordinate and a y co-ordinate.  The co-
       ordinates are relative to the center of the map sheet to be drawn,
       measured in Earth radii at the reference location on the map.  For all of
       the functions whose names begin with 'from', the return value is a list
       comprising the longitude and latitude, in degrees.

CHOOSING A PROJECTION
       This package offers a great many projections, because no single
       projection is appropriate to all maps.  This section attempts to provide
       guidance on how to choose a projection.

       First, consider the type of data that you intend to display on the map.
       If the data are directional (e.g., winds, ocean currents, or magnetic
       fields) then you need to use a projection that preserves angles; these
       are known as conformal projections.  Conformal projections include the
       Mercator, the Albers azimuthal equal-area, the stereographic, and the
       Peirce Quincuncial projection.  If the data are thematic, describing
       properties of land or water, such as temperature, population density,
       land use, or demographics; then you need a projection that will show
       these data with the areas on the map proportional to the areas in real
       life.  These so-called equal area projections include the various
       cylindrical equal area projections, the sinusoidal projection, the
       Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection, the Albers equal-area conic
       projection, and several of the world-map projections (Miller Cylindrical,
       Mollweide, Eckert IV, Eckert VI, Robinson, and Hammer). If the
       significant factor in your data is distance from a central point or line
       (such as air routes), then you will do best with an equidistant
       projection such as plate carrée, Cassini, azimuthal equidistant, or conic
       equidistant.  If direction from a central point is a critical factor in
       your data (for instance, air routes, radio antenna pointing), then you
       will almost surely want to use one of the azimuthal projections.
       Appropriate choices are azimuthal equidistant, azimuthal equal-area,
       stereographic, and perhaps orthographic.

       Next, consider how much of the Earth your map will cover, and the general
       shape of the area of interest.  For maps of the entire Earth, the
       cylindrical equal area, Eckert IV and VI, Mollweide, Robinson, and Hammer
       projections are good overall choices.  The Mercator projection is
       traditional, but the extreme distortions of area at high latitudes make
       it a poor choice unless a conformal projection is required. The Peirce
       projection is a better choice of conformal projection, having less
       distortion of landforms.  The Miller Cylindrical is a compromise designed
       to give shapes similar to the traditional Mercator, but with less polar
       stretching.  The Peirce Quincuncial projection shows all the continents
       with acceptable distortion if a reference meridian close to +20 degrees
       is chosen.  The Robinson projection yields attractive maps for things
       like political divisions, but should be avoided in presenting scientific
       data, since other projections have moe useful geometric properties.

       If the map will cover a hemisphere, then choose stereographic, azimuthal-
       equidistant, Hammer, or Mollweide projections; these all project the
       hemisphere into a circle.

       If the map will cover a large area (at least a few hundred km on a side),
       but less than a hemisphere, then you have several choices.  Azimuthal
       projections are usually good (choose stereographic, azimuthal
       equidistant, or Lambert azimuthal equal-area according to whether shapes,
       distances from a central point, or areas are important).  Azimuthal
       projections (and possibly the Cassini projection) are the only really
       good choices for mapping the polar regions.

       If the large area is in one of the temperate zones and is round or has a
       primarily east-west extent, then the conic projections are good choices.
       Choose the Lambert conformal conic, the conic equidistant, or the Albers
       equal-area conic according to whether shape, distance, or area are the
       most important parameters.  For any of these, the reference parallels
       should be chosen at approximately 1/6 and 5/6 of the range of latitudes
       to be displayed.  For instance, maps of the 48 coterminous United States
       are attractive with reference parallels of 28.5 and 45.5 degrees.

       If the large area is equatorial and is round or has a primarily east-west
       extent, then the Mercator projection is a good choice for a conformal
       projection; Lambert cylindrical equal-area and sinusoidal projections are
       good equal-area projections; and the plate carrée is a good equidistant
       projection.

       Large areas having a primarily North-South aspect, particularly those
       spanning the Equator, need some other choices.  The Cassini projection is
       a good choice for an equidistant projection (for instance, a Cassini
       projection with a central meridian of 80 degrees West produces an
       attractive map of the Americas). The cylindrical equal-area, Albers
       equal-area conic, sinusoidal, Mollweide and Hammer projections are
       possible choices for equal-area projections.  A good conformal projection
       in this situation is the Transverse Mercator, which alas, is not yet
       implemented.

       Small areas begin to get into a realm where the ellipticity of the Earth
       affects the map scale.  This package does not attempt to handle accurate
       mapping for large-scale topographic maps.  If slight scale errors are
       acceptable in your application, then any of the projections appropriate
       to large areas should work for small ones as well.

       There are a few projections that are included for their special
       properties.  The orthographic projection produces views of the Earth as
       seen from space.  The gnomonic projection produces a map on which all
       great circles (the shortest distance between two points on the Earth's
       surface) are rendered as straight lines.  While this projection is useful
       for navigational planning, it has extreme distortions of shape and area,
       and can display only a limited area of the Earth (substantially less than
       a hemisphere).
