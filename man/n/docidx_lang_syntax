NAME
       docidx_lang_syntax - docidx language syntax

DESCRIPTION
       This document contains the formal specification of the syntax of the
       docidx markup language, version 1 in Backus-Naur-Form. This document is
       intended to be a reference, complementing the docidx language command
       reference.  A beginner should read the much more informally written
       docidx language introduction first before trying to understand either
       this document or the command reference.

FUNDAMENTALS
       In the broadest terms possible the docidx markup language is like SGML
       and similar languages. A document written in this language consists
       primarily of markup commands, with text embedded into it at some places.

       Each markup command is a just Tcl command surrounded by a matching pair
       of [ and ]. Which commands are available, and their arguments, i.e.
       syntax is specified in the docidx language command reference.

       In this document we specify first the lexeme, and then the syntax, i.e.
       how we can mix text and markup commands with each other.

LEXICAL DEFINITIONS
       In the syntax rules listed in the next section

       [1]    <TEXT> stands for all text except markup commands.

       [2]    Any XXX stands for the markup command [xxx] including its
              arguments. Each markup command is a Tcl command surrounded by a
              matching pair of [ and ]. Inside of these delimiters the usual
              rules for a Tcl command apply with regard to word quotation,
              nested commands, continuation lines, etc.

       [3]    <WHITE> stands for all text consisting only of spaces, newlines,
              tabulators and the comment markup command.

SYNTAX
       The rules listed here specify only the syntax of docidx documents. The
       lexical level of the language was covered in the previous section.

       Regarding the syntax of the (E)BNF itself

       [1]    The construct { X } stands for zero or more occurrences of X.

       [2]    The construct [ X ] stands for zero or one occurrence of X.

       The syntax:

       index     = defs
                   INDEX_BEGIN
                   [ contents ]
                   INDEX_END
                   { <WHITE> }

       defs      = { INCLUDE | VSET | <WHITE> }
       contents  = keyword { keyword }

       keyword   = defs KEY ref { ref }
       ref       = MANPAGE | URL | defs

       At last a rule we were unable to capture in the EBNF syntax, as it is
       about the arguments of the markup commands, something which is not
       modeled here.

       [1]    The arguments of all markup commands have to be plain text, and/or
              text markup commands, i.e. one of

              [1]    lb,

              [2]    rb, or

              [3]    vset (1-argument form).
