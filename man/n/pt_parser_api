DESCRIPTION
       Are you lost ?  Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In
       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to Parser
       Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the current
       package is a part of.

       This document describes the API shared by the grammar interpreter
       provided by the package pt::peg::interp and the parsers generated by the
       pt application for the result formats critcl, snit, and oo regarding
       access to the actual parsing functionality.

       Its intended audience are people who wish to create a parser for some
       language of theirs and then use that parser within a Tcl-based package or
       application.

       It resides in the User Layer of Parser Tools.

CLASS API
       className ?objectName?
              The class command constructs parser instances, i.e. objects. The
              result of the command is the fully-qualified name of the instance
              command.

              If no objectName is specified the class will generate and use an
              automatic name. If the objectName was specified, but is not fully
              qualified the command will be created in the curent namespace.

INSTANCE API
       All parser instances provide at least the methods shown below:

       objectName destroy
              This method destroys the parser instance, releasing all claimed
              memory and other resources, and deleting the instance command.

              The result of the command is the empty string.

       objectName parse chan
              This method runs the parser using the contents of chan as input
              (starting at the current location in the channel), until parsing
              is not possible anymore, either because parsing has completed, or
              run into a syntax error.

              Note here that the Parser Tools are based on Tcl 8.5+. In other
              words, the channel argument is not restricted to files, sockets,
              etc. We have the full power of reflected channels available.

              It should also be noted that the parser pulls the characters from
              the input stream as it needs them. If a parser created by this
              package has to be operated in a push aka event-driven manner it
              will be necessary to go to Tcl 8.6+ and use the coroutine::auto to
              wrap it into a coroutine where read is properly changed for push-
              operation.

              Upon successful completion the command returns an abstract syntax
              tree as its result.  This AST is in the form specified in section
              AST serialization format.  As a plain nested Tcl-list it can then
              be processed with any Tcl commands the user likes, doing
              transformations, semantic checks, etc.  To help in this the
              package pt::ast provides a set of convenience commands for
              validation of the tree's basic structure, printing it for
              debugging, and walking it either from the bottom up, or top down.

              When encountering a syntax error the command will throw an error
              instead.  This error will be a 4-element Tcl-list, containing, in
              the order listed below:

              [1]    The string pt::rde identifying it as parser runtime error.

              [2]    The location of the parse error, as character offset from
                     the beginning of the parsed input.

              [3]    The location of parse error, now as a 2-element list
                     containing line-number and column in the line.

              [4]    A set of atomic parsing expressions indicating encoding the
                     characters and/or nonterminal symbols the parser expected
                     to see at the location of the parse error, but did not get.
                     For the specification of atomic parsing expressions please
                     see the section PE serialization format.

       objectName parset text
              This method runs the parser using the string in text as input.  In
              all other ways it behaves like the method parse, shown above.

USAGE
       A generated parser is used like this

           package require the-parser-package ;# Generated by result-formats 'critcl', 'snit' or 'oo' of 'pt'.
           set parser [the-parser-class]

           set ast [$parser parse $channel]
           ... process the abstract syntax tree ...

       When using a grammar interpreter for parsing some differences creep in

           package require the-grammar-package ;# Generated by result-format 'container' of 'pt'.
           set grammar [the-grammar-class]

           package require pt::peg::interp
           set parser [pt::peg::interp]

           $parser use $grammar

           set ast [$parser parse $channel]
           $parser destroy

           ... process the abstract syntax tree ...


AST SERIALIZATION FORMAT
       Here we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize Abstract
       Syntax Trees (ASTs) as immutable values for transport, comparison, etc.

       Each node in an AST represents a nonterminal symbol of a grammar, and the
       range of tokens/characters in the input covered by it. ASTs do not
       contain terminal symbols, i.e. tokens/characters. These can be recovered
       from the input given a symbol's location.

       We distinguish between regular and canonical serializations.  While a
       tree may have more than one regular serialization only exactly one of
       them will be canonical.

       Regular serialization

              [1]    The serialization of any AST is the serialization of its
                     root node.

              [2]    The serialization of any node is a Tcl list containing at
                     least three elements.

                     [1]    The first element is the name of the nonterminal
                            symbol stored in the node.

                     [2]    The second and third element are the locations of
                            the first and last token in the token stream the
                            node represents (covers).

                            [1]    Locations are provided as non-negative
                                   integer offsets from the beginning of the
                                   token stream, with the first token found in
                                   the stream located at offset 0 (zero).

                            [2]    The end location has to be equal to or larger
                                   than the start location.

                     [3]    All elements after the first three represent the
                            children of the node, which are themselves nodes.
                            This means that the serializations of nodes without
                            children, i.e. leaf nodes, have exactly three
                            elements.  The children are stored in the list with
                            the leftmost child first, and the rightmost child
                            last.

       Canonical serialization
              The canonical serialization of an abstract syntax tree has the
              format as specified in the previous item, and then additionally
              satisfies the constraints below, which make it unique among all
              the possible serializations of this tree.

              [1]    The string representation of the value is the canonical
                     representation of a pure Tcl list. I.e. it does not contain
                     superfluous whitespace.

   EXAMPLE
       Assuming the parsing expression grammar below


       PEG calculator (Expression)
           Digit      <- '0'/'1'/'2'/'3'/'4'/'5'/'6'/'7'/'8'/'9'   ;
           Sign       <- '-' / '+'                       ;
           Number     <- Sign? Digit+                         ;
           Expression <- '(' Expression ')' / (Factor (MulOp Factor)*)  ;
           MulOp      <- '*' / '/'                       ;
           Factor     <- Term (AddOp Term)*                   ;
           AddOp      <- '+'/'-'                         ;
           Term       <- Number                     ;
       END;


       and the input string
        120+5
       then a parser should deliver the abstract syntax tree below (except for
       whitespace)


       set ast {Expression 0 4
           {Factor 0 4
               {Term 0 2
                   {Number 0 2
                       {Digit 0 0}
                       {Digit 1 1}
                       {Digit 2 2}
                   }
               }
               {AddOp 3 3}
               {Term 4 4
                   {Number 4 4
                       {Digit 4 4}
                   }
               }
           }
       }

              Combined Parsing Expressions

                     [1]    For parsing expressions e1, e2, ... the result of
                            [list / e1 e2 ... ] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the ordered choice, aka prioritized choice.

                     [2]    For parsing expressions e1, e2, ... the result of
                            [list x e1 e2 ... ] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the sequence.

                     [3]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list * e]
                            is a parsing expression as well.  This is the kleene
                            closure, describing zero or more repetitions.

                     [4]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list + e]
                            is a parsing expression as well.  This is the
                            positive kleene closure, describing one or more
                            repetitions.

                     [5]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list & e]
                            is a parsing expression as well.  This is the and
                            lookahead predicate.

                     [6]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list ! e]
                            is a parsing expression as well.  This is the not
                            lookahead predicate.

                     [7]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list ? e]
                            is a parsing expression as well.  This is the
                            optional input.

       Canonical serialization
              The canonical serialization of a parsing expression has the format
              as specified in the previous item, and then additionally satisfies
              the constraints below, which make it unique among all the possible
              serializations of this parsing expression.

              [1]    The string representation of the value is the canonical
                     representation of a pure Tcl list. I.e. it does not contain
                     superfluous whitespace.

              [2]    Terminals are not encoded as ranges (where start and end of
                     the range are identical).

   EXAMPLE
       Assuming the parsing expression shown on the right-hand side of the rule


           Expression <- '(' Expression ')'
                       / Factor (MulOp Factor)*


       then its canonical serialization (except for whitespace) is


           {/ {x {t (} {n Expression} {t )}} {x {n Factor} {* {x {n MulOp} {n Factor}}}}}
