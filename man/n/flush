NAME
       flush - Flush buffered output for a channel

SYNOPSIS
       flush channelId
________________________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       Flushes any output that has been buffered for channelId.

       ChannelId must be an identifier for an open channel such as a Tcl
       standard channel (stdout or stderr), the return value from an invocation
       of open or socket, or the result of a channel creation command provided
       by a Tcl extension.  The channel must have been opened for writing.

       If the channel is in blocking mode the command does not return until all
       the buffered output has been flushed to the channel. If the channel is in
       nonblocking mode, the command may return before all buffered output has
       been flushed; the remainder will be flushed in the background as fast as
       the underlying file or device is able to absorb it.

EXAMPLE
       Prompt for the user to type some information in on the console:
              puts -nonewline "Please type your name: "
              flush stdout
              gets stdin name
              puts "Hello there, $name!"
