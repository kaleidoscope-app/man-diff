NAME
       pwd - Return the absolute path of the current working directory

SYNOPSIS
       pwd
________________________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       Returns the absolute path name of the current working directory.

EXAMPLE
       Sometimes it is useful to change to a known directory when running some
       external command using exec, but it is important to keep the application
       usually running in the directory that it was started in (unless the user
       specifies otherwise) since that minimizes user confusion. The way to do
       this is to save the current directory while the external command is being
       run:
              set tarFile [file normalize somefile.tar]
              set savedDir [pwd]
              cd /tmp
              exec tar -xf $tarFile
              cd $savedDir
