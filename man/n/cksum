       ::crc::cksum ?-format format? ?-chunksize size? [ -channel chan |
       -filename file | string ]

       ::crc::CksumInit

       ::crc::CksumUpdate token data

       ::crc::CksumFinal token

DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a Tcl implementation of the cksum(1) algorithm
       based upon information provided at in the GNU implementation of this
       program as part of the GNU Textutils 2.0 package.

COMMANDS
       ::crc::cksum ?-format format? ?-chunksize size? [ -channel chan |
       -filename file | string ]
              The command takes string data or a channel or file name and
              returns a checksum value calculated using the cksum(1) algorithm.
              The result is formatted using the format(n) specifier provided or
              as an unsigned integer (%u) by default.

OPTIONS
       -channel name
              Return a checksum for the data read from a channel. The command
              will read data from the channel until the eof is true. If you need
              to be able to process events during this calculation see the
              PROGRAMMING INTERFACE section

       -filename name
              This is a convenience option that opens the specified file, sets
              the encoding to binary and then acts as if the -channel option had
              been used. The file is closed on completion.

       -format string
              Return the checksum using an alternative format template.

PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
       The cksum package implements the checksum using a context variable to
       which additional data can be added at any time. This is expecially useful
       in an event based environment such as a Tk application or a web server
       package. Data to be checksummed may be handled incrementally during a
       fileevent handler in discrete chunks. This can improve the interactive
       nature of a GUI application and can help to avoid excessive memory
       consumption.

       ::crc::CksumInit
              Begins a new cksum context. Returns a token ID that must be used
              for the remaining functions. An optional seed may be specified if
              required.

       ::crc::CksumUpdate token data
              Add data to the checksum identified by token. Calling CksumUpdate
              $token "abcd" is equivalent to calling CksumUpdate $token "ab"
              followed by CksumUpdate $token "cb". See EXAMPLES.

       ::crc::CksumFinal token
              Returns the checksum value and releases any resources held by this
              token. Once this command completes the token will be invalid. The
              result is a 32 bit integer value.

EXAMPLES

       % crc::cksum "Hello, World!"
       2609532967



       % crc::cksum -format 0x%X "Hello, World!"
       0x9B8A5027



       % crc::cksum -file cksum.tcl
       1828321145



       % set tok [crc::CksumInit]
       % crc::CksumUpdate $tok "Hello, "
       % crc::CksumUpdate $tok "World!"
       % crc::CksumFinal $tok
