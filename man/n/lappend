NAME
       lappend - Append list elements onto a variable

SYNOPSIS
       lappend varName ?value value value ...?
________________________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       This command treats the variable given by varName as a list and appends
       each of the value arguments to that list as a separate element, with
       spaces between elements.  If varName does not exist, it is created as a
       list with elements given by the value arguments.  Lappend is similar to
       append except that the values are appended as list elements rather than
       raw text.  This command provides a relatively efficient way to build up
       large lists.  For example, “lappend a $b” is much more efficient than
       “set a [concat $a [list $b]]” when $a is long.

EXAMPLE
       Using lappend to build up a list of numbers.
              % set var 1
              1
              % lappend var 2
              1 2
              % lappend var 3 4 5
              1 2 3 4 5
