NAME
       base32::core - Expanding basic base32 maps

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tcl  8.4

       package require base32::core  ?0.1?

       ::base32::core::define map forwvar backwvar ivar

       ::base32::core::valid string pattern mvar

DESCRIPTION
       This package provides generic commands for the construction of full
       base32 mappings from a basic mapping listing just the codes and
       associated characters. The full mappings, regular and inverse, created
       here map to and from bit sequences, and also handle the partial mappings
       at the end of a string.

       This is in essence an internal package to be used by implementors of a
       base32 en- and decoder. A regular user has no need of this package at
       all.

API
       ::base32::core::define map forwvar backwvar ivar
              This command computes full forward and backward (inverse) mappings
              from the basic map and stores them in the variables named by
              forwvar and backwvar resp. It also constructs a regexp pattern for
              the detection of invalid characters in supposedly base32 encoded
              input and stores it in the variable named by ivar.

       ::base32::core::valid string pattern mvar
              This command checks if the input string is a valid base32 encoded
              string, based on the pattern of invalid characters as generated by
              ::base32::core::define, and some other general rules.

              The result of the command is a boolean flag. Its value is True for
              a valid string, and False otherwise. In the latter case an error
              message describing the problem with the input is stored into the
              variable named by mvar. The variable is not touched if the input
              was found to be valid.

              The rules checked by the command, beyond rejection of bad
              characters, are:

              [1]    The length of the input is not a multiple of eight,

              [2]    The padding appears not at the end of input, but in the
                     middle,

              [3]    The padding has not of length six, four, three, or one
                     characters,
