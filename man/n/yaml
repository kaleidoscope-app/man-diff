DESCRIPTION
       The yaml package provides a simple Tcl-only library for parsing the YAML
       http://www.yaml.org/ data exchange format as specified in
       http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.1/.

       The yaml package returns data as a Tcl dict.  Either the dict package or
       Tcl 8.5 is required for use.

COMMANDS
       ::yaml::yaml2dict ?options? txt

       ::yaml::yaml2huddle ?options? txt
              Parse yaml formatted text txt into a Tcl dict/huddle and return
              the value.

              -file  txt is a filename of YAML-stream.

              -stream
                     txt is just a YAML-stream.

              -types list
                     The list is a type list for the yaml-scalar types.(e.g.
                     !!str !!timestamp !!integer !!true ...)
                      -types {timestamp integer null true false}
                     In this case, if a string matched "timestamp", converted to
                     the TCL internal timestamp.(e.g. "2001-12-15T02:59:43.1Z"
                     => 1008385183)

              -m:true param
                     The param is two elements of list for the value of true,
                     and considered strings.
                      -m:true {1 {true on + yes y}}
                     In this case, the string "yes" found in YAML Stream,
                     automatically converted 1.

              -m:false param
                     The param is two elements of list for the value of false,
                     and considered strings.
                      -m:false {0 {false off - no n}}

              -m:null param
                     The param is two elements of list for the value of null,
                     and considered strings.
                      -m:null {"" {null nil "" ~}}

              -validate
                     Experiment,old: Output stream contains YAML's-tag, each
                     node.
                     % puts [::yaml::load -validate {[aaa, bbb]}]
                     =>
                     !!seq {{!!str aaa} {!!str bbb}}


       ::yaml::setOption ?options?
              Change implicit options for the library.  Now, the params are the
              same as ::yaml::yaml2dict.  Arguments of::yaml::yaml2dict is more
              priority than this setting.

       ::yaml::dict2yaml dict ?indent? ?wordwrap?

       ::yaml::list2yaml list ?indent? ?wordwrap?

       ::yaml::huddle2yaml huddle ?indent? ?wordwrap?
              Convert a dict/list/huddle object into YAML stream.

              indent spaces indent of each block node.  currently default is 2.

              wordwrap
                     word wrap for YAML stream.  currently default is 40.

EXAMPLES
       An example of a yaml stream converted to Tcl.  A yaml stream is returned
       as a single item with multiple elements.
