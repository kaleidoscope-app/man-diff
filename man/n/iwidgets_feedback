DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::feedback command creates a widget to display feedback on
       the current status of an ongoing operation to the user. Display is given
       as a percentage and as a thermometer type bar. Options exist for adding a
       label and controlling its position.


METHODS
       The iwidgets::feedback command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
       pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
       widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following commands are possible for scrolledtext widgets:


WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              scrolledhtml command.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::feedback command.

       pathName reset
              Reset the current number of steps completed to 0, and configures
              the percentage complete label text to 0%

       pathName step ?inc?
              Increase the current number of steps completed by the amount
              specified by inc. Inc defaults to 1.


EXAMPLE

               package require Iwidgets 4.0
               iwidgets::feedback .fb -labeltext "Status" -steps 20
               pack .fb -padx 10 -pady 10 -fill both -expand yes

               for {set i 0} {$i < 20} {incr i} {
                   .fb step
                   after 500
               }
