       winfo - Return window-related information

SYNOPSIS
       winfo option ?arg arg ...?
________________________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       The winfo command is used to retrieve information about windows managed
       by Tk.  It can take any of a number of different forms, depending on the
       option argument.  The legal forms are:

       winfo atom ?-displayof window? name
              Returns a decimal string giving the integer identifier for the
              atom whose name is name.  If no atom exists with the name name
              then a new one is created.  If the -displayof option is given then
              the atom is looked up on the display of window;  otherwise it is
              looked up on the display of the application's main window.

       winfo atomname ?-displayof window? id
              Returns the textual name for the atom whose integer identifier is
              id.  If the -displayof option is given then the identifier is
              looked up on the display of window;  otherwise it is looked up on
              the display of the application's main window.  This command is the
              inverse of the winfo atom command.  It generates an error if no
              such atom exists.

       winfo cells window
              Returns a decimal string giving the number of cells in the color
              map for window.

       winfo children window
              Returns a list containing the path names of all the children of
              window. Top-level windows are returned as children of their
              logical parents. The list is in stacking order, with the lowest
              window first, except for Top-level windows which are not returned
              in stacking order. Use the wm stackorder command to query the
              stacking order of Top-level windows.

       winfo class window
              Returns the class name for window.

       winfo colormapfull window
              Returns 1 if the colormap for window is known to be full, 0
              otherwise.  The colormap for a window is “known” to be full if the
              last attempt to allocate a new color on that window failed and
              this application has not freed any colors in the colormap since
              the failed allocation.

       winfo containing ?-displayof window? rootX rootY
              Returns the path name for the window containing the point given by
              rootX and rootY.  RootX and rootY are specified in screen units
              (i.e.  any form acceptable to Tk_GetPixels) in the coordinate
              system of the root window (if a virtual-root window manager is in
              use then the coordinate system of the virtual root window is
              used).  If the -displayof option is given then the coordinates
              refer to the screen containing window;  otherwise they refer to
              the screen of the application's main window.  If no window in this
              application contains the point then an empty string is returned.
              In selecting the containing window, children are given higher
              priority than parents and among siblings the highest one in the
              stacking order is chosen.

       winfo depth window
              Returns a decimal string giving the depth of window (number of
              bits per pixel).

       winfo exists window
              Returns 1 if there exists a window named window, 0 if no such
              window exists.

       winfo fpixels window number
              Returns a floating-point value giving the number of pixels in
              window corresponding to the distance given by number.  Number may
              be specified in any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetScreenMM,
              such as “2.0c” or “1i”.  The return value may be fractional;  for
              an integer value, use winfo pixels.

       winfo geometry window
              Returns the geometry for window, in the form widthxheight+x+y.
              All dimensions are in pixels.

       winfo height window
              Returns a decimal string giving window's height in pixels.  When a
              window is first created its height will be 1 pixel;  the height
              will eventually be changed by a geometry manager to fulfill the
              window's needs.  If you need the true height immediately after
              creating a widget, invoke update to force the geometry manager to
              arrange it, or use winfo reqheight to get the window's requested
              height instead of its actual height.

       winfo id window
              Returns a hexadecimal string giving a low-level platform-specific
              identifier for window.  On Unix platforms, this is the X window
              identifier.  Under Windows, this is the Windows HWND.  On the
              Macintosh the value has no meaning outside Tk.

       winfo interps ?-displayof window?
              Returns a list whose members are the names of all Tcl interpreters
              (e.g. all Tk-based applications) currently registered for a
              particular display.  If the -displayof option is given then the
              return value refers to the display of window;  otherwise it refers
              to the display of the application's main window.

       winfo ismapped window
              Returns 1 if window is currently mapped, 0 otherwise.

       winfo manager window
              Returns the name of the geometry manager currently responsible for
              window, or an empty string if window is not managed by any
              geometry manager.  The name is usually the name of the Tcl command
              for the geometry manager, such as pack or place.  If the geometry
              manager is a widget, such as canvases or text, the name is the
              widget's class command, such as canvas.

       winfo name window
              Returns window's name (i.e. its name within its parent, as opposed
              to its full path name).  The command winfo name . will return the
              name of the application.

       winfo parent window
              Returns the path name of window's parent, or an empty string if
              window is the main window of the application.

       winfo pathname ?-displayof window? id
              Returns the path name of the window whose X identifier is id.  Id
              must be a decimal, hexadecimal, or octal integer and must
              correspond to a window in the invoking application.  If the
              -displayof option is given then the identifier is looked up on the
              display of window;  otherwise it is looked up on the display of
              the application's main window.

       winfo pixels window number
              Returns the number of pixels in window corresponding to the
              distance given by number.  Number may be specified in any of the
              forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels, such as “2.0c” or “1i”.  The
              result is rounded to the nearest integer value;  for a fractional
              result, use winfo fpixels.

       winfo pointerx window
              If the mouse pointer is on the same screen as window, returns the
              pointer's x coordinate, measured in pixels in the screen's root
              window.  If a virtual root window is in use on the screen, the
              position is measured in the virtual root.  If the mouse pointer is
              not on the same screen as window then -1 is returned.

       winfo pointerxy window
              If the mouse pointer is on the same screen as window, returns a
              list with two elements, which are the pointer's x and y
              coordinates measured in pixels in the screen's root window.  If a
              virtual root window is in use on the screen, the position is
              computed in the virtual root.  If the mouse pointer is not on the
              same screen as window then both of the returned coordinates are
              -1.

       winfo pointery window
              If the mouse pointer is on the same screen as window, returns the
              pointer's y coordinate, measured in pixels in the screen's root
              window.  If a virtual root window is in use on the screen, the
              position is computed in the virtual root.  If the mouse pointer is
              not on the same screen as window then -1 is returned.

       winfo reqheight window
              Returns a decimal string giving window's requested height, in
              pixels.  This is the value used by window's geometry manager to
              compute its geometry.

       winfo reqwidth window
              Returns a decimal string giving window's requested width, in
              pixels.  This is the value used by window's geometry manager to
              compute its geometry.

       winfo rgb window color
              Returns a list containing three decimal values in the range 0 to
              65535, which are the red, green, and blue intensities that
              correspond to color in the window given by window.  Color may be
              specified in any of the forms acceptable for a color option.

       winfo rootx window
              Returns a decimal string giving the x-coordinate, in the root
              window of the screen, of the upper-left corner of window's border
              (or window if it has no border).

       winfo rooty window
              Returns a decimal string giving the y-coordinate, in the root
              window of the screen, of the upper-left corner of window's border
              (or window if it has no border).

       winfo screen window
              Returns the name of the screen associated with window, in the form
              displayName.screenIndex.

       winfo screencells window
              Returns a decimal string giving the number of cells in the default
              color map for window's screen.

       winfo screendepth window
              Returns a decimal string giving the depth of the root window of
              window's screen (number of bits per pixel).

       winfo screenheight window
              Returns a decimal string giving the height of window's screen, in
              pixels.

       winfo screenmmheight window
              Returns a decimal string giving the height of window's screen, in
              millimeters.

       winfo screenmmwidth window
              Returns a decimal string giving the width of window's screen, in
              millimeters.

       winfo screenvisual window
              Returns one of the following strings to indicate the default
              visual class for window's screen: directcolor, grayscale,
              pseudocolor, staticcolor, staticgray, or truecolor.

       winfo screenwidth window
              Returns a decimal string giving the width of window's screen, in
              pixels.

       winfo server window
              Returns a string containing information about the server for
              window's display.  The exact format of this string may vary from
              platform to platform.  For X servers the string has the form
              “XmajorRminor vendor vendorVersion” where major and minor are the
              version and revision numbers provided by the server (e.g., X11R5),
              vendor is the name of the vendor for the server, and vendorRelease
              is an integer release number provided by the server.

       winfo toplevel window
              Returns the path name of the top-of-hierarchy window containing
              window.  In standard Tk this will always be a toplevel widget, but
              extensions may create other kinds of top-of-hierarchy widgets.

       winfo viewable window
              Returns 1 if window and all of its ancestors up through the
              nearest toplevel window are mapped.  Returns 0 if any of these
              windows are not mapped.

       winfo visual window
              Returns one of the following strings to indicate the visual class
              for window: directcolor, grayscale, pseudocolor, staticcolor,
              staticgray, or truecolor.

       winfo visualid window
              Returns the X identifier for the visual for window.

       winfo visualsavailable window ?includeids?
              Returns a list whose elements describe the visuals available for
              window's screen.  Each element consists of a visual class followed
              by an integer depth.  The class has the same form as returned by
              winfo visual.  The depth gives the number of bits per pixel in the
              visual.  In addition, if the includeids argument is provided, then
              the depth is followed by the X identifier for the visual.

       winfo vrootheight window
              Returns the height of the virtual root window associated with
              window if there is one;  otherwise returns the height of window's
              screen.

       winfo vrootwidth window
              Returns the width of the virtual root window associated with
              window if there is one;  otherwise returns the width of window's
              screen.

       winfo vrootx window
              Returns the x-offset of the virtual root window associated with
              window, relative to the root window of its screen.  This is
              normally either zero or negative.  Returns 0 if there is no
              virtual root window for window.

       winfo vrooty window
              Returns the y-offset of the virtual root window associated with
              window, relative to the root window of its screen.  This is
              normally either zero or negative.  Returns 0 if there is no
              virtual root window for window.

       winfo width window
              Returns a decimal string giving window's width in pixels.  When a
              window is first created its width will be 1 pixel;  the width will
              eventually be changed by a geometry manager to fulfill the
              window's needs.  If you need the true width immediately after
              creating a widget, invoke update to force the geometry manager to
              arrange it, or use winfo reqwidth to get the window's requested
              width instead of its actual width.

       winfo x window
              Returns a decimal string giving the x-coordinate, in window's
              parent, of the upper-left corner of window's border (or window if
              it has no border).

       winfo y window
              Returns a decimal string giving the y-coordinate, in window's
              parent, of the upper-left corner of window's border (or window if
              it has no border).

EXAMPLE
       Print where the mouse pointer is and what window it is currently over:
              lassign [winfo pointerxy .] x y
              puts -nonewline "Mouse pointer at ($x,$y) which is "
              set win [winfo containing $x $y]
              if {$win eq ""} {
                  puts "over no window"
              } else {
                  puts "over $win"
              }
