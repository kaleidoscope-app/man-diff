DESCRIPTION
       The package pop3d::dbox provides simple/basic mailbox management
       facilities. Each mailbox object manages a single base directory whose
       subdirectories represent the managed mailboxes. Mails in a mailbox are
       represented by files in a mailbox directory, where each of these files
       contains a single mail, both headers and body, in RFC 822
       (http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc822.txt) conformant format.

       Any mailbox object following the interface described below can be used in
       conjunction with the pop3 server core provided by the package pop3d. It
       is especially possible to directly use the objects created by this
       package in the storage callback of pop3 servers following the same
       interface as servers created by the package pop3d.

       ::pop3d::dbox::new ?dbName?
              This command creates a new database object with an associated
              global Tcl command whose name is dbName.

       The command dbName may be used to invoke various operations on the
       database.  It has the following general form:

       dbName option ?arg arg ...?
              Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.

       The following commands are possible for database objects:

       dbName destroy
              Destroys the mailbox database and all transient data. The
              directory associated with the object is not destroyed.

       dbName base base
              Defines the base directory containing the mailboxes to manage. If
              this method is not called none of the following methods will work.

       dbName add mbox
              Adds a mailbox of name mbox to the database. The name must be a
              valid path component.

       dbName remove mbox
              Removes the mailbox specified through mbox, and the mails
              contained therein, from the database. This method will fail if the
              specified mailbox is locked.

       dbName move old new
              Changes the name of the mailbox old to new.

       dbName list
              Returns a list containing the names of all mailboxes in the
              directory associated with the database.

       dbName exists mbox
              Returns true if the mailbox with name mbox exists in the database,
              or false if not.

       dbName locked mbox
              Checks if the mailbox specified through mbox is currently locked.

       dbName lock mbox
              This method locks the specified mailbox for use by a single
              connection to the server. This is necessary to prevent havoc if
              several connections to the same mailbox are open. The
              complementary method is unlock. The command will return true if
              the lock could be set successfully or false if not.

       dbName unlock mbox
              This is the complementary method to lock, it revokes the lock on
              the specified mailbox.

       dbName stat mbox
              Determines the number of messages in the specified mailbox and
              returns this number. This method fails if the mailbox mbox is not
              locked.

       dbName size mbox ?msgId?
              Determines the size of the message specified through its id in
              msgId, in bytes, and returns this number. The command will return
              the size of the whole maildrop if no message id was specified.  If
              specified the msgId has to be in the range "1 ... [dbName stat]"
              or this call will fail. If stat was not called before this call,
              size will assume that there are zero messages in the mailbox.

       dbName dele mbox msgList
              Deletes the messages whose numeric ids are contained in the
              msgList from the mailbox specified via mbox.  The msgList must not
              be empty or this call will fail.  The numeric ids in msgList have
              to be in the range "1 ...  [dbName stat]" or this call will fail.
              If stat was not called before this call, dele will assume that
              there are zero messages in the mailbox.

       storageCmd get mbox msgId
              Returns a handle for the specified message. This handle is a mime
              token following the interface described in the documentation of
              package mime. The token is read-only. In other words, the caller
              is allowed to do anything with the token except to modify it.  The
              msgId has to be in the range "1 ...  [dbName stat]" or this call
              will fail. If stat was not called before this call, get will
              assume that there are zero messages in the mailbox.
