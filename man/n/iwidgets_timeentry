DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::timeentry command creates a time entry field with a popup
       watch by combining the timefield and watch widgets together.  This allows
       a user to enter the time via the keyboard or by using the mouse and
       selecting the watch icon which brings up a popup watch.



METHODS
       The iwidgets::timeentry command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
       pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
       widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following commands are possible for timeentry widgets:

INHERITED METHODS
       get             isvalid        show

       See the "timefield" manual entry for details on the associated methods.

WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::timeentry command.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::timeentry command.
