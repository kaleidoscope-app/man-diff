NAME
       doctools_intro - doctools introduction

DESCRIPTION
       doctools (short for documentation tools) stands for a set of related, yet
       different, entities which are working together for the easy creation and
       transformation of documentation. These are

       [1]    A tcl based language for the semantic markup of text. Markup is
              represented by Tcl commands interspersed with the actual text.

       [2]    A package providing the ability to read and transform texts
              written in that markup language. It is important to note that the
              actual transformation of the input text is delegated to plugins.

       [3]    An API describing the interface between the package above and a
              plugin.

       Which of the more detailed documents are relevant to the reader of this
       introduction depends on their role in the documentation process.

       [1]    A writer of documentation has to understand the markup language
              itself. A beginner to doctools should read the more informally
              written doctools language introduction first. Having digested this
              the formal doctools language syntax specification should become
              understandable. A writer experienced with doctools may only need
              the doctools language command reference from time to time to
              refresh her memory.

              While a document is written the dtplite application can be used to
              validate it, and after completion it also performs the conversion
              into the chosen system of visual markup, be it *roff, HTML, plain
              text, wiki, etc.

       [2]    A processor of documentation written in the doctools markup
              language has to know which tools are available for use.

              The main tool is the aforementioned dtplite application provided
              by Tcllib. A more powerful one (in terms of options and ability to
              configure it) is the dtp application, provided by Tclapps.  At the
              bottom level, common to both applications, however sits the
              package doctools, providing the basic facilities to read and
              process files containing text in the doctools format.

       [3]    At last, but not least, plugin writers have to understand the
              interaction between the doctools package and its plugins, as
              described in the doctools plugin API reference.

RELATED FORMATS
       doctools does not stand alone, it has two companion formats. These are
       called docidx and doctoc, and they are for the markup of keyword indices,
       and tables of contents, respectively.  They are described in their own
       sets of documents, starting at the docidx introduction and the doctoc
       introduction, respectively.
