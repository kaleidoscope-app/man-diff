DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a single command to perform actions on multiple
       files selected by glob patterns. It is a thin layer over the package
       fileutil::multi::op which provides objects for the same. This package
       simply creates a single such object and directs all file commands to it.

       At the core is a domain specific language allowing the easy specification
       of multi-file copy and/or move and/or deletion operations. Alternate
       names would be scatter/gather processor, or maybe even assembler.  For
       the detailed specification of this language, and examples, please see the
       documention for the package fileutil::multi::op.

PUBLIC API
       The main command of the package is:

       ::fileutil::multi ?word...?
              This command interprets the specified words as file commands to
              execute. See the section FILE API of the documentation for the
              package fileutil::multi::op for the set of acceptable commands,
              their syntax, and semantics.

              The result of the command is the result generated by the last file
              command it executed.
