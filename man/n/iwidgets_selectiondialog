DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::selectiondialog command creates a selection box similar to
       the OSF/Motif standard selection dialog composite widget.  The
       selectiondialog is derived from the Dialog class and is composed of a
       selectionbox with commands to manipulate the dialog buttons.


METHODS
       The iwidgets::selectiondialog command creates a new Tcl command whose
       name is pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations
       on the widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following commands are possible for selectiondialog widgets:

WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::selectiondialog command.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::selectiondialog
              command.
