DESCRIPTION
       This package allows scrollbars to be mapped and unmapped as needed
       depending on the size and content of the scrollbars scrolled widget. The
       scrollbar must be managed by either pack or grid, other geometry managers
       are not supported.

       When managed by pack, any geometry changes made in the scrollbars parent
       between the time a scrollbar is unmapped, and when it is mapped will be
       lost. It is an error to destroy any of the scrollbars siblings while the
       scrollbar is unmapped. When managed by grid, if anything becomes gridded
       in the same row and column the scrollbar occupied it will be replaced by
       the scrollbar when remapped.

       This package may be used on any scrollbar-like widget as long as it
       supports the set subcommand in the same style as scrollbar. If the set
       subcommand is not used then this package will have no effect.

       ::autoscroll::autoscroll scrollbar
              Arranges for the already existing scrollbar scrollbar to be mapped
              and unmapped as needed.

       ::autoscroll::unautoscroll scrollbar
              Returns the named scrollbar to its original static state.

       ::autoscroll::wrap
              Arranges for all scrollbars created after this command is run to
              be automatically mapped and unmapped as needed.

       ::autoscroll::unwrap
              Turns off the automatic autoscrolling of all new scrollbars.  Does
              not effect existing scrollbars


       text .t -yscrollcommand ".scrolly set"
       scrollbar .scrolly -orient v -command ".t yview"
       pack .scrolly -side right -fill y
       pack .t -side left -fill both -expand 1
