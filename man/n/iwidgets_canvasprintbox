ASSOCIATED OPTIONS
WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       Name:           filename
       Class:          FileName
       Command-Line Switch:           -filename

              The file to write the postscript output to (Only when output is
              set to "file"). If posterizing is turned on and hpagecnt and/or
              vpagecnt is more than 1, x.y is appended to the filename where x
              is the horizontal page number and y the vertical page number.

       Name:           hpagecnt
       Class:          PageCnt
       Command-Line Switch:           -hpagecnt

              Is used in combination with posterize to determine over how many
              pages the output should be distributed. This attribute specifies
              how many pages should be used horizontaly.  Any change to this
              attribute will automatically update the "stamp".  Defaults to 1.

       Name:           orient
       Class:          Orient
       Command-Line Switch:           -orient

              Determines the orientation of the output to the printer (or file).
              It can take the value "portrait" or "landscape" (default). Changes
              to this attribute will be reflected immediately in the "stamp".
              Defaults to "landscape" but will be changed automaticaly to the
              value deemed appropiate for the current canvas. Setting this
              attribute when the canvasprintbox is first constructed (instead of
              using the "configure" method) will turn off the auto adjustment of
              this attribute.

       Name:           output
       Class:          Output
       Command-Line Switch:           -output

              Specifies where the postscript output should go: to the printer or
              to a file. Can take on the values "printer" or "file".  The
              corresponding entry-widget will reflect the contents of either the
              printcmd attribute or the filename attribute.  Defaults to
              "printer".

       Name:           pageSize
       Class:          PageSize
       Command-Line Switch:           -pagesize

              The pagesize the printer supports. Changes to this attribute will
              be reflected immediately in the "stamp".  Defaults to "a4".

       Name:           posterize
       Class:          Posterize
       Command-Line Switch:           -posterize

              Indicates if posterizing is turned on or not. Posterizing the
              output means that it is possible to distribute the output over
              more than one page. This way it is possible to print a
              canvas/region which is larger than the specified pagesize without
              stretching. If used in combination with stretching it can be used
              to "blow up" the contents of a canvas to as large as size as you
              want (See attributes: hpagecnt and vpagecnt). Any change to this
              attribute will automatically update the "stamp".  Defaults to 0.

       Name:           printCmd
       Class:          PrintCmd
       Command-Line Switch:           -printcmd

              The command to execute when printing the postscript output.  The
              command will get the postscript directed to its standard input
              (Only when output is set to "printer").  Defaults to "lpr".

       Name:           printRegion
       Class:          PrintRegion
       Command-Line Switch:           -printregion

              A list of four coordinates specifying which part of the canvas to
              print.  An empty list means that the canvas' entire scrollregion
              should be printed. Any change to this attribute will automatically
              update the "stamp".  Defaults to an empty list.

       Name:           stretch
       Class:          Stretch
       Command-Line Switch:           -stretch

              Determines if the output should be stretched to fill the page (as
              defined by the attribute pagesize) as large as possible. The
              aspect-ratio of the output will be retained and the output will
              never fall outside of the boundaries of the page.  Defaults to 0
              but will be changed automaticaly to the value deemed appropiate
              for the current canvas. Setting this attribute when the
              canvasprintbox is first constructed (instead of using the
              "configure" method) will turn off the auto adjustment of this
              attribute.

       Name:           vPageCnt
       Class:          PageCnt
       Command-Line Switch:           -vpagecnt

              Is used in combination with "posterize" to determine over how many
              pages the output should be distributed. This attribute specifies
              how many pages should be used verticaly.  Any change to this
              attribute will automatically update the "stamp".  Defaults to 1.

DESCRIPTION
       Implements a print box for printing the contents of a canvas widget to a
       printer or a file. It is possible to specify page orientation, the number
       of pages to print the image on and if the output should be stretched to
       fit the page. Options exist to control the appearance and actions of the
       widget.


METHODS
       The iwidgets::canvasprintbox command creates a new Tcl command whose name
       is pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on
       the widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following commands are possible for canvasprintbox widgets:


WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::canvasprintbox command.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::canvasprintbox
              command.

       pathName getoutput
              Returns the value of the printercmd or filename option depending
              on the current setting of output.

       pathName print
              Perfrom the actual printing of the canvas using the current
              settings of all the attributes. Returns a boolean indicating
              wether the printing was successful or not.

       pathName refresh
              Retrieves the current value for all edit fields and updates the
              stamp accordingly. Is useful for Apply-buttons.

       pathName setcanvas canvas
              This is used to set the canvas that has to be printed.  A stamp-
              sized copy will automatically be drawn to show how the output
              would look with the current settings.

       pathName stop
              Stops the drawing of the "stamp". I'm currently unable to detect
              when a Canvasprintbox gets destroyed or withdrawn. It's therefore
              advised that you perform a stop before you do something like that.

COMPONENTS
       Name:           prtflentry
       Class:          Entry

              The prtflentry component is the entry field for user input of the
              filename or printer command (depending on the value of output).

       Name:           hpcnt
       Class:          Entry

              The hpcnt component is the entry field for user input of the
              number of pages to use horizontaly when posterize is turned on.
              Name:           vpcnt
              Class:          Entry

              The vpcnt component is the entry field for user input of the
              number of pages to use verticaly when posterize is turned on.
