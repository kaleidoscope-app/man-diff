DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a class for the creation of a simple paging text
       display.

CLASS API
       The package exports a single command, the class command, enabling the
       creation of pager instances. Its API is:

       term::interact::pager object text ?options...?
              This command creates a new pager object with the name object,
              initializes it, and returns the fully qualified name of the object
              command as its result.

              The argument is the text to show, possibly followed by
              configuration options and their values. The options are explained
              in the section Configuration.

OBJECT API
       The objects created by the class command provide the methods listed
       below:

       object interact
              Show the pager in the screen at the configured location and start
              interacting with it. This opens its own event loop for the
              processing of incoming characters. The method returns when the
              interaction has completed. See section Interaction for a
              description of the possible interaction.

       object done
              This method can be used by user supplied actions to terminate the
              interaction with the object.

       object clear
              This method can be used by user supplied actions to remove the
              pager from the terminal.

       object text text
              This method can be used to change the text shown by the pager.
              The pager will reset the dispay to show the first line of the text
              at the top.

       object configure

       object configure option

       object configure option value...

       object cget option
              Standard methods to retrieve and configure the options of the
              pager.

CONFIGURATION
       A pager instance recognizes the following options:

       -in chan
              Specifies the channel to read character sequences from. Defaults
              to stdin.

       -out chan
              Specifies the channel to write the pager contents to. Defaults to
              stdout.

       -column int
              Specifies the column of the terminal where the left margin of the
              pager display should appear. Defaults to 0, i.e. the left-most
              column.

       -line int
              Specifies the line of the terminal where the top margin of the
              pager display should appear. Defaults to 0, i.e. the top-most
              line.

       -height int
              Specifies the number of lines of text to show at most in the
              display. Defaults to 25.

       -actions dict
              Specifies a dictionary containing additional actions, using
              character sequences as keys. Note that these sequences cannot
              override the hardwired sequences described in section Interaction.

INTERACTION
       A pager object recognizes the control sequences listed below and acts as
       described. The user can supply more control sequences to act on via the
       configuration, but is not able to overide these defaults.

       Cursor Up
              The text is scrolled down a single line, making one more line
              visible at the top. The pager will not react if the first line of
              the text is already shown.

       Cursor Down
              The text is scrolled up a single line, making one more line
              visible at the bottom. The pager will not react if the last line
              of the text is already shown.

       Page Up
              The text is scrolled down a page. The pager will not react if the
              first line of the text is already shown.

       Page Down
              The text is scrolled up a page. The pager will not react if the
              last line of the text is already shown.

       Enter/Return
              The interaction with the object is terminated.
