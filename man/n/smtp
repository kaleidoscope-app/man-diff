DESCRIPTION
       The smtp library package provides the client side of the Simple Mail
       Transfer Protocol (SMTP) (1) (2).

       ::smtp::sendmessage token option...
              This command sends the MIME part (see package mime) represented by
              token to an SMTP server. options is a list of options and their
              associated values.  The recognized options are:

              -servers
                     A list of SMTP servers. The default is localhost.

              -ports A list of SMTP ports. The default is 25.

              -client
                     The name to use as our hostname when connecting to the
                     server. By default this is either localhost if one of the
                     servers is localhost, or is set to the string returned by
                     info hostname.

              -queue Indicates that the SMTP server should be asked to queue the
                     message for later processing. A boolean value.

              -atleastone
                     Indicates that the SMTP server must find at least one
                     recipient acceptable for the message to be sent. A boolean
                     value.

              -originator
                     A string containing an 822-style address specification. If
                     present the header isn't examined for an originator
                     address.

              -recipients
                     A string containing one or more 822-style address
                     specifications. If present the header isn't examined for
                     recipient addresses). If the string contains more than one
                     address they will be separated by commas.

              -header
                     A list containing two elements, an smtp header and its
                     associated value (the -header option may occur zero or more
                     times).

              -usetls
                     This package supports the RFC 3207 TLS extension (3) by
                     default provided the tls package is available. You can turn
                     this off with this boolean option.

              -tlspolicy
                     This option lets you specify a command to be called if an
                     error occurs during TLS setup. The command is called with
                     the SMTP code and diagnostic message appended. The command
                     should return 'secure' or 'insecure' where insecure will
                     cause the package to continue on the unencrypted channel.
                     Returning 'secure' will cause the socket to be closed and
                     the next server in the -servers list to be tried.

              -username

              -password
                     If your SMTP server requires authentication (RFC 2554 (4))
                     before accepting mail you can use -username and -password
                     to provide your authentication details to the server.
                     Currently this package supports DIGEST-MD5, CRAM-MD5, LOGIN
                     and PLAIN authentication methods. The most secure method
                     will be tried first and each method tried in turn until we
                     are either authorized or we run out of methods. Note that
                     if the server permits a TLS connection, then the
                     authorization will occur after we begin using the secure
                     channel.

       If the -originator option is not present, the originator address is taken
       from From (or Resent-From); similarly, if the -recipients option is not
       present, recipient addresses are taken from To, cc, and Bcc (or Resent-
       To, and so on). Note that the header key/values supplied by the -header
       option (not those present in the MIME part) are consulted. Regardless,
       header key/values are added to the outgoing message as necessary to
       ensure that a valid 822-style message is sent.

       The command returns a list indicating which recipients were unacceptable
       to the SMTP server. Each element of the list is another list, containing
       the address, an SMTP error code, and a textual diagnostic. Depending on
       the -atleastone option and the intended recipients, a non-empty list may
       still indicate that the message was accepted by the server.

EXAMPLE

       proc send_simple_message {recipient email_server subject body} {
           package require smtp
           package require mime

           set token [mime::initialize -canonical text/plain \\
            -string $body]
           mime::setheader $token Subject $subject
           smtp::sendmessage $token \\
            -recipients $recipient -servers $email_server
           mime::finalize $token
       }

       send_simple_message someone@somewhere.com localhost \\
           "This is the subject." "This is the message."
