NAME
       doctools::msgcat - Message catalog management for the various document
       parsers

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tcl  8.4

       package require msgcat

       package require doctools::msgcat  ?0.1?

       ::doctools::msgcat::init prefix

DESCRIPTION
       The package doctools::msgcat is a support module handling the selection
       of message catalogs for the various document processing packages in the
       doctools system version 2. As such it is an internal package a regular
       user (developer) should not be in direct contact with.

       If you are such please go the documentation of either

       [1]    doctools::doc,

       [2]    doctools::toc, or

       [3]    doctools::idx

       Within the system architecture this package resides under the various
       parser packages, and is shared by them. Underneath it, but not explicit
       dependencies, are the packages providing the message catalogs for the
       various languages.

API
       ::doctools::msgcat::init prefix
              The command locates and loads the message catalogs for all the
              languages returned by msgcat::mcpreferences, provided that they
              could be found. It returns an integer number describing how many
              packages were found and loaded.

              The names of the packages the command will look for have the form
              "doctools::msgcat::prefix::langcode", with prefix the argument to
              the command, and the langcode supplied by the result of
              msgcat::mcpreferences.
