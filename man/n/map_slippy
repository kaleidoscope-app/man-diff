DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a number of methods doing things needed by all
       types of slippy-based map packages.

API
       ::map::slippy length level
              This method returns the width/height of a slippy-based map at the
              specified zoom level, in pixels. This is, in essence, the result
              of

                   expr { [tiles $level] * [tile size] }


       ::map::slippy tiles level
              This method returns the width/height of a slippy-based map at the
              specified zoom level, in tiles.

       ::map::slippy tile size
              This method returns the width/height of a tile in a slippy-based
              map, in pixels.

       ::map::slippy tile valid tile levels ?msgvar?
              This method checks whether tile described a valid tile in a
              slippy-based map containing that many zoom levels. The result is a
              boolean value, true if the tile is valid, and false otherwise. For
              the latter a message is left in the variable named by msgvar,
              should it be specified.

              A tile identifier as stored in tile is a list containing zoom
              level, tile row, and tile column, in this order. The command
              essentially checks this, i.e. the syntax, that the zoom level is
              between 0 and "levels-1", and that the row/col information is
              within the boundaries for the zoom level, i.e. 0 ...  "[tiles
              $zoom]-1".

       ::map::slippy geo 2tile geo
              Converts a geographical location at a zoom level (geo, a list
              containing zoom level, latitude, and longitude, in this order) to
              a tile identifier (list containing zoom level, row, and column) at
              that level.

       ::map::slippy geo 2point geo
              Converts a geographical location at a zoom level (geo, a list
              containing zoom level, latitude, and longitude, in this order) to
              a pixel position (list containing zoom level, y, and x) at that
              level.

       ::map::slippy tile 2geo tile
              Converts a tile identifier at a zoom level (tile, list containing
              zoom level, row, and column) to a geographical location (list
              containing zoom level, latitude, and longitude, in this order) at
              that level.

       ::map::slippy tile 2point tile
              Converts a tile identifier at a zoom level (tile, a list
              containing zoom level, row, and column, in this order) to a pixel
              position (list containing zoom level, y, and x) at that level.

       ::map::slippy point 2geo point
              Converts a pixel position at a zoom level (point, list containing
              zoom level, y, and x) to a geographical location (list containing
              zoom level, latitude, and longitude, in this order) at that level.

       ::map::slippy point 2tile point
              Converts a pixel position at a zoom level (point, a list
              containing zoom level, y, and x, in this order) to a tile
              identifier (list containing zoom level, row, and column) at that
              level.
