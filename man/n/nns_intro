NAME
       nns_intro - Name service facility, introduction

DESCRIPTION
       nns (short for nano nameservice) is a facility built for the package
       comm, adding a simple name service to it.  It is also built on top of
       comm, using it for the exchange of messages between the client and server
       parts.

       This name service facility has nothing to do with the Internet's Domain
       Name System, otherwise known as DNS. If the reader is looking for a
       package dealing with that please see either of the packages dns and
       resolv, both found in Tcllib too.

       Tcllib provides 2 applications and 4 packages which are working together
       and provide access to the facility at different levels.

APPLICATIONS
       The application nnsd provides a simple name server which can be run by
       anybody anywhere on their system, as they see fit.  It is also an example
       on the use of the server-side package nameserv::server.

       Complementing this server is the nns client application.  A possible, but
       no very sensible use would be to enter name/port bindings into a server
       from a shell script. Not sensible, as shell scripts normally do not
       provide a comm-based service.

       The only case for this to make some sense would be in a shell script
       wrapped around a Tcl script FOO which is using comm, to register the
       listening port used by FOO.  However even there it would much more
       sensible to extend FOO to use the nameservice directly. And in regard on
       how to that nns can be used as both example and template.  Beyond that it
       may also be useful to perform nameservice queries from shell scripts.

       The third application, nnslog is a stripped down form of the nns client
       application. It is reduced to perform a continuous search for all changes
       and logs all received events to stdout.

       Both clients use the nameserv::auto package to automatically hande the
       loss and restoration of the connection to the server.

PACKAGES
       The two main packages implementing the service are nameserv and
       nameserv::server, i.e. client and server. The latter has not much of an
       API, just enough to start, stop, and configure it. See the application
       nnsd on how to use it.

       The basic client, in package nameserv, provides the main API to
       manipulate and query the service. An example of its use is the
       application nns.

       The second client package, nameserv::auto is API compatible to the basic
       client, but provides the additional functionality that it will
       automatically restore data like bound names when the connection to the
       name service was lost and then reestablished. I.e. it automatically
       detects the loss of the server and re-enters the data when the server
       comes back.

       The package nameserv::common is of no interest to users. It is an
       internal package containing code and definitions common to the packages
       nameserv and nameserv::server.

       All packages use the uevent package for the reporting of special
       circumstances via events, and reserve the uevent-tag nameserv for their
       exclusive use. All their events will be posted to that tag.

INTERNALS
       The document Name service facility, client/server protocol specifies the
       protocol used by the packages nameserv and nameserv::server to talk to
       each other. It is of no interest to users of either the packages or
       applications.

       Developers wishing to modify and/or extend or to just understand the
       internals of the nameservice facility however are strongly advised to
       read it.
