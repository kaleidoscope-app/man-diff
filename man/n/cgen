DESCRIPTION
       This package provides the generator backend for a compiler of magic(5)
       files into recognizers based on the fileutil::magic::rt recognizer
       runtime package. For the compiler frontend using this generator see the
       package fileutil::magic::cfront.

COMMANDS
       ::fileutil::magic::cgen::2tree script
              This command converts the recognizer specified by the script into
              a tree and returns the object command of that tree as its result.
              It uses the package struct::tree for the tree.

              The script is in the format specified by magic(5).

       ::fileutil::magic::cgen::treedump tree
              This command takes a tree as generated by
              ::fileutil::magic::cgen::2tree and returns a string encoding the
              tree for human consumption, to aid in debugging.

       ::fileutil::magic::cgen::treegen tree node
              This command takes a tree as generated by
              ::fileutil::magic::cgen::2tree and returns a Tcl script, the
              recognizer for the file types represented by the sub-tree rooted
              at the node.  The generated script makes extensive use of the
              commands provided by the recognizer runtime package
              fileutil::magic::rt to perform its duties.
