DESCRIPTION
       The ::struct namespace contains a commands for processing finite queues.

       It exports a single command, ::struct::queue. All functionality provided
       here can be reached through a subcommand of this command.

       Note: As of version 1.4.1 of this package a critcl based C implementation
       is available. This implementation however requires Tcl 8.4 to run.

       The ::struct::queue command creates a new queue object with an associated
       global Tcl command whose name is queueName.  This command may be used to
       invoke various operations on the queue.  It has the following general
       form:

       queueName option ?arg arg ...?
              Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.
              The following commands are possible for queue objects:

       queueName clear
              Remove all items from the queue.

       queueName destroy
              Destroy the queue, including its storage space and associated
              command.

       queueName get ?count?
              Return the front count items of the queue and remove them from the
              queue.  If count is not specified, it defaults to 1.  If count is
              1, the result is a simple string; otherwise, it is a list.  If
              specified, count must be greater than or equal to 1.  If there are
              not enoughs items in the queue to fulfull the request, this
              command will throw an error.

       queueName peek ?count?
              Return the front count items of the queue, without removing them
              from the queue.  If count is not specified, it defaults to 1.  If
              count is 1, the result is a simple string; otherwise, it is a
              list.  If specified, count must be greater than or equal to 1.  If
              there are not enoughs items in the queue to fulfull the request,
              this command will throw an error.

       queueName put item ?item ...?
              Put the item or items specified into the queue.  If more than one
              item is given, they will be added in the order they are listed.

       queueName unget item
              Put the item into the queue, at the front, i.e. before any other
              items already in the queue. This makes this operation the
              complement to the method get.

       queueName size
              Return the number of items in the queue.
