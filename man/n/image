________________________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       The image command is used to create, delete, and query images.  It can
       take several different forms, depending on the option argument.  The
       legal forms are:

       image create type ?name? ?option value ...?
              Creates a new image and a command with the same name and returns
              its name.  type specifies the type of the image, which must be one
              of the types currently defined (e.g., bitmap).  name specifies the
              name for the image;  if it is omitted then Tk picks a name of the
              form imagex, where x is an integer.  There may be any number of
              option-value pairs, which provide configuration options for the
              new image.  The legal set of options is defined separately for
              each image type;  see below for details on the options for built-
              in image types.  If an image already exists by the given name then
              it is replaced with the new image and any instances of that image
              will redisplay with the new contents.  It is important to note
              that the image command will silently overwrite any procedure that
              may currently be defined by the given name, so choose the name
              wisely.  It is recommended to use a separate namespace for image
              names (e.g., ::img::logo, ::img::large).

       image delete ?name name ...?
              Deletes each of the named images and returns an empty string.  If
              there are instances of the images displayed in widgets, the images
              will not actually be deleted until all of the instances are
              released.  However, the association between the instances and the
              image manager will be dropped.  Existing instances will retain
              their sizes but redisplay as empty areas.  If a deleted image is
              recreated with another call to image create, the existing
              instances will use the new image.

       image height name
              Returns a decimal string giving the height of image name in
              pixels.

       image inuse name
              Returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the image given
              by name is in use by any widgets.

       image names
              Returns a list containing the names of all existing images.

       image type name
              Returns the type of image name (the value of the type argument to
              image create when the image was created).

       image types
              Returns a list whose elements are all of the valid image types
              (i.e., all of the values that may be supplied for the type
              argument to image create).

       image width name
              Returns a decimal string giving the width of image name in pixels.

       Additional operations (e.g. writing the image to a file) may be available
       as subcommands of the image instance command. See the manual page for the
       particular image type for details.

BUILT-IN IMAGE TYPES
       The following image types are defined by Tk so they will be available in
       any Tk application.  Individual applications or extensions may define
       additional types.

       bitmap Each pixel in the image displays a foreground color, a background
              color, or nothing.  See the bitmap manual entry for more
              information.

       photo  Displays a variety of full-color images, using dithering to
              approximate colors on displays with limited color capabilities.
              See the photo manual entry for more information.
