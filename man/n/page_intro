NAME
       page_intro - page introduction

DESCRIPTION
       page (short for parser generator) stands for a set of related packages
       which help in the construction of parser generators, and other utilities
       doing text processing.

       They are mainly geared towards supporting the Tcllib application page,
       with the package page::pluginmgr in a central role as the plugin
       management for the application. The other packages are performing low-
       level text processing and utility tasks geared towards parser generation
       and mainly accessed by page through plugins.

       The packages implementing the plugins are not documented as regular
       packages, as they cannot be loaded into a general interpreter, like
       tclsh, without extensive preparation of the interpreter. Preparation
       which is done for them by the plugin manager.
