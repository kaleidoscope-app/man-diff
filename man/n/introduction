NAME
       doctools2toc_introduction - DocTools - Tables of Contents

DESCRIPTION
       doctoc (short for documentation tables of contents) stands for a set of
       related, yet different, entities which are working together for the easy
       creation and transformation of tables and contents for documentation.

       These are

       [1]    A tcl based language for the semantic markup of a table of
              contents.  Markup is represented by Tcl commands.  Beginners
              should start with the doctoc language introduction.  The formal
              specification is split over two documents, one dealing with the
              doctoc language syntax, the other a doctoc language command
              reference.

       [2]    A set of packages for the programmatic manipulation of tables of
              contents in memory, and their conversion between various formats,
              reading and writing. The aforementioned markup language is one of
              the formats which can be both read from and written to.

       [3]    The system for the conversion of tables of contents is based on a
              plugin mechanism, for this we have two APIs describing the
              interface between the packages above and the import/export
              plugins.

       Which of the more detailed documents are relevant to the reader of this
       introduction depends on their role in the documentation process.

       [1]    A writer of documentation has to understand the markup language
              itself. A beginner to doctoc should read the more informally
              written doctoc language introduction first. Having digested this
              the formal doctoc language syntax specification should become
              understandable. A writer experienced with doctoc may only need the
              doctoc language command reference from time to time to refresh her
              memory.

              While a document is written the dtp application can be used to
              validate it, and after completion it also performs the conversion
              into the chosen system of visual markup, be it *roff, HTML, plain
              text, wiki, etc. The simpler dtplite application makes internal
              use of doctoc when handling directories of documentation,
              automatically generating a proper table of contents for them.

       [2]    A processor of documentation written in the doctoc markup language
              has to know which tools are available for use.

              The main tool is the aforementioned dtp application provided by
              Tcllib. The simpler dtplite does not expose doctoc to the user. At
              the bottom level, common to both applications, however we find the
              three packages providing the basic facilities to handle tables of
              contents, i.e. import from textual formats, programmatic
              manipulation in memory, and export to textual formats. These are

              doctoools::toc
                     Programmatic manipulation of tables of contents in memory.

              doctoools::toc::import
                     Import of tables of contents from various textual formats.
                     The set of supported formats is extensible through plugin
                     packages.

              doctoools::toc::export
                     Export of tables of contents to various textual formats.
                     The set of supported formats is extensible through plugin
                     packages.
       See also section Package Overview for an overview of the dependencies
       between these and other, supporting packages.

       [3]    At last, but not least, plugin writers have to understand the
              interaction between the import and export packages and their
              plugins.  These APIs are described in the documentation for the
              two relevant packages, i.e.

              •      doctoools::toc::import

              •      doctoools::toc::export

RELATED FORMATS
       The doctoc format does not stand alone, it has two companion formats.
       These are called docidx and doctools, and they are intended for the
       markup of keyword indices, and of general documentation, respectively.
       They are described in their own sets of documents, starting at the
       DocTools - Keyword Indices and the DocTools - General, respectively.
