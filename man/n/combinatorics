DESCRIPTION
       The math package contains implementations of several functions useful in
       combinatorial problems.

COMMANDS
       ::math::ln_Gamma z
              Returns the natural logarithm of the Gamma function for the
              argument z.

              The Gamma function is defined as the improper integral from zero
              to positive infinity of

                t**(x-1)*exp(-t) dt


              The approximation used in the Tcl Math Library is from Lanczos,
              ISIAM J. Numerical Analysis, series B, volume 1, p. 86.  For "x >
              1", the absolute error of the result is claimed to be smaller than
              5.5*10**-10 -- that is, the resulting value of Gamma when

                exp( ln_Gamma( x) )

              is computed is expected to be precise to better than nine
              significant figures.

       ::math::factorial x
              Returns the factorial of the argument x.

              For integer x, 0 <= x <= 12, an exact integer result is returned.

              For integer x, 13 <= x <= 21, an exact floating-point result is
              returned on machines with IEEE floating point.

              For integer x, 22 <= x <= 170, the result is exact to 1 ULP.

              For real x, x >= 0, the result is approximated by computing
              Gamma(x+1) using the ::math::ln_Gamma function, and the result is
              expected to be precise to better than nine significant figures.

              It is an error to present x <= -1 or x > 170, or a value of x that
              is not numeric.

       ::math::choose n k
              Returns the binomial coefficient C(n, k)

                 C(n,k) = n! / k! (n-k)!

              If both parameters are integers and the result fits in 32 bits,
              the result is rounded to an integer.

              Integer results are exact up to at least n = 34.  Floating point
              results are precise to better than nine significant figures.

       ::math::Beta z w
              Returns the Beta function of the parameters z and w.

                 Beta(z,w) = Beta(w,z) = Gamma(z) * Gamma(w) / Gamma(z+w)

              Results are returned as a floating point number precise to better
              than nine significant digits provided that w and z are both at
              least 1.
