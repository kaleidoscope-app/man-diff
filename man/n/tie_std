DESCRIPTION
       The packages listed as requirements for this document are internal
       packages providing the standard data sources of package tie, as described
       in section STANDARD DATA SOURCE TYPES of tie's documentation.

       They are automatically loaded and registered by tie when it itself is
       requested, and as such there is no need to request them on their own,
       although it is possible to do so.
