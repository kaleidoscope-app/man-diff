DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a Tcl-only implementation of the uuencode(1) and
       uudecode(1) commands. This encoding packs binary data into printable
       ASCII characters.

       ::uuencode::encode string
              returns the uuencoded data. This will encode all the data passed
              in even if this is longer than the uuencode maximum line length.
              If the number of input bytes is not a multiple of 3 then
              additional 0 bytes are added to pad the string.

       ::uuencode::decode string
              Decodes the given encoded data. This will return any padding
              characters as well and it is the callers responsibility to deal
              with handling the actual length of the encoded data. (see
              uuencode).

       ::uuencode::uuencode ?-name string? ?-mode octal? (-file filename | ?--?
       string)

       ::uuencode::uudecode (-file filename | ?--? string)
              UUDecode a file or block of data. A file may contain more than one
              embedded file so the result is a list where each element is a
              three element list of filename, mode value and data.

OPTIONS
       -filename name
              Cause the uuencode or uudecode commands to read their data from
              the named file rather that taking a string parameter.

       -name string
              The uuencoded data header line contains the suggested file name to
              be used when unpacking the data. Use this option to change this
              from the default of "data.dat".

       -mode octal
              The uuencoded data header line contains a suggested permissions
              bit pattern expressed as an octal string. To change the default of
              0644 you can set this option. For instance, 0755 would be suitable
              for an executable. See chmod(1).

EXAMPLES

       % set d [uuencode::encode "Hello World!"]
       2&5L;&\\@5V]R;&0A



       % uuencode::uudecode $d
       Hello World!



       % set d [uuencode::uuencode -name hello.txt "Hello World"]
       begin 644 hello.txt
       +2&5L;&\@5V]R;&0`
       `
       end



       % uuencode::uudecode $d
       {hello.txt 644 {Hello World}}
