DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::timefield command creates an enhanced text entry widget for
       the purpose of time entry with various degrees of built-in intelligence.



METHODS
       The iwidgets::timefield command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
       pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
       widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following commands are possible for timefield widgets:

WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::timefield command.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::timefield command.

       pathName get ?format?
              Returns the current contents of the timefield in a format of
              string or as an integer clock value using the -string and -clicks
              format options respectively.  The default is by string.  Reference
              the clock command for more information on obtaining times and
              their formats.

       pathName isvalid
              Returns a boolean indication of the validity of the currently
              displayed time value.  For example, 12:59:59 is valid whereas
              25:59:59 is invalid.

       pathName show time
              Changes the currently displayed time to be that of the time
              argument.  The time may be specified either as a string, an
              integer clock value or the keyword "now" (the default).  Reference
              the clock command for more information on obtaining times and
              their formats.


COMPONENTS
       Name:           time
       Class:          Entry

              The time component provides the entry field for time input and
              display.  See the "entry" widget manual entry for details on the
              time component item.


EXAMPLE

               package require Iwidgets 4.0

                 puts [.tf get]
               }

               iwidgets::timefield .tf -command returnCmd
               pack .tf -fill x -expand yes -padx 10 -pady 10
