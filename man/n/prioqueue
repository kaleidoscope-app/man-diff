DESCRIPTION
       This package implements a simple priority queue using nested tcl lists.

       The command ::struct::prioqueue creates a new priority queue with default
       priority key type -integer. This means that keys given to the put
       subcommand must have this type.

       This also sets the priority ordering. For key types -ascii and
       -dictionary the data is sorted in ascending order (as with lsort
       -increasing), thereas for -integer and -real the data is sorted in
       descending order (as with lsort -decreasing).

       Prioqueue names are unrestricted, but may be recognized as options if no
       priority type is given.

       ::struct::prioqueue ?-ascii|-dictionary|-integer|-real? ?prioqueueName?
              The ::struct::prioqueue command creates a new prioqueue object
              with an associated global Tcl command whose name is prioqueueName.
              This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
              prioqueue.  It has the following general form:

       prioqueueName option ?arg arg ...?
              option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.
              The following commands are possible for prioqueue objects:

       prioqueueName clear
              Remove all items from the prioqueue.

       prioqueueName remove item
              Remove the selected item from this priority queue.

       prioqueueName destroy
              Destroy the prioqueue, including its storage space and associated
              command.

       prioqueueName get ?count?
              Return the front count items of the prioqueue (but not their
              priorities) and remove them from the prioqueue.  If count is not
              specified, it defaults to 1.  If count is 1, the result is a
              simple string; otherwise, it is a list.  If specified, count must
              be greater than or equal to 1.  If there are no or too few items
              in the prioqueue, this command will throw an error.

       prioqueueName peek ?count?
              Return the front count items of the prioqueue (but not their
              priorities), without removing them from the prioqueue.  If count
              is not specified, it defaults to 1.  If count is 1, the result is
              a simple string; otherwise, it is a list.  If specified, count
              must be greater than or equal to 1.  If there are no or too few
              items in the queue, this command will throw an error.

       prioqueueName peekpriority ?count?
              Return the front count items priority keys, without removing them
              from the prioqueue.  If count is not specified, it defaults to 1.
              If count is 1, the result is a simple string; otherwise, it is a
              list.  If specified, count must be greater than or equal to 1.  If
              there are no or too few items in the queue, this command will
              throw an error.

       prioqueueName put item prio ?item prio ...?
              Put the item or items specified into the prioqueue. prio must be a
              valid priority key for this type of prioqueue, otherwise an error
              is thrown and no item is added.  Items are inserted at their
              priority ranking. Items with equal priority are added in the order
              they were added.

       prioqueueName size
              Return the number of items in the prioqueue.
