DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a command for the recognition of file types in pure
       Tcl. The output is standardized to mime-types.

       The core part of the recognizer was generated from a "magic(5)" file
       containing the checks to perform to recognize files, and associated mime-
       types.

       ::fileutil::magic::mimetype filename
              This command is similar to the command fileutil::fileType.

              The output of the command for the specified file is not a list of
              attributes describing the type of the file, but a list of standard
              mime-types the file may have.

              This list will be empty if the type of the file is not recognized.

              contains the current sources for the file command, including the
              magic definitions used by it. The latter were used by us to
              generate this recognizer.
