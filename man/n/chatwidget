DESCRIPTION
       This is a composite widget designed to simplify the construction of chat
       applications. The widget contains display areas for chat messages, user
       names and topic and an entry area. It automatically handles colourization
       of messages per nick and manages nick completion. A system of hooks
       permit the application author to adjust display features. The main chat
       display area may be split for use displaying history or for searching.

       The widget is made up of a number of text widget and panedwindow widgets
       so that the size of each part of the display may be adjusted by the user.
       All the text widgets may be accessed via widget passthrough commands if
       fine adjustment is required. The topic and names sections can also be
       hidden if desired.

COMMANDS
       ::chatwidget::chatwidget path ?options?
              Create a new chatwidget using the Tk window id path. Any options
              provided are currently passed directly to the main chat text
              widget.

                     If ?-full? is given then the list returned is a list of
                     lists where each sublist is made up of the nick followed by
                     any options that have been set on this nick entry. This may
