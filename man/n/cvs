DESCRIPTION
       This package provides Tcl commands for the processing and reformatting
       text in the format generated by the cvs log command.

       The commands ::doctools::cvs::scanLog and ::doctools::cvs::toChangeLog
       are derived from code found on the Tcl'ers Wiki [http://wiki.tcl.tk]. See
       the references at the end of the page.

API
       ::doctools::cvs::scanLog text evar cvar fvar
              The command takes the text and parses it under the assumption that
              it contains a CVS log as generated by cvs log. The resulting
              information is stored in the variables whose names were specified
              via evar, cvar, and fvar.

              Already existing information in the referenced variables is
              preserved, allowing the caller to merge data from multiple logs
              into one database.

              varname evar (in)
                     Has to refer to a scalar variable. After the call this
                     variable will contain a list of all the entries found in
                     the log file. An entry is identified through the
                     combination of date and author, and can be split over
                     multiple physical entries, one per touched file.

                     It should be noted that the entries are listed in the same
                     order as they were found in the text. This is not
                     necessarily sorted by date or author.

                     Each item in the list is a list containing two elements,
                     the date of the entry, and its author, in this order. The
                     date is formatted as year/month/day.

              varname cvar (in)
                     Has to refer to an array variable. Keys are strings
                     containing the date and author of log entries, in this
                     order, separated by a comma.

                     The values are lists of comments made for the entry.

              varname fvar (in)
                     Has to refer to an array variable. Keys are strings
                     containing date, author of a log entry, and a comment for
                     that entry, in this order, separated by commas.

                     The values are lists of the files the entry is touching.


       ::doctools::cvs::toChangeLog evar cvar fvar
              ] The three arguments for this command are the same as the last
              three arguments of the command ::doctools::cvs::scanLog. This
              command however expects them to be filled with information about
              one or more logs. It takes this information and converts it into a
              text in the format of a ChangeLog as accepted and generated by
              emacs. The constructed text is returned as the result of the
              command.
