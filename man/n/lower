lower(n)                      Tk Built-In Commands                      lower(n)



________________________________________________________________________________

NAME
       lower - Change a window's position in the stacking order

SYNOPSIS
       lower window ?belowThis?
________________________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       If the belowThis argument is omitted then the command lowers window so
       that it is below all of its siblings in the stacking order (it will be
       obscured by any siblings that overlap it and will not obscure any
       siblings).  If belowThis is specified then it must be the path name of a
       window that is either a sibling of window or the descendant of a sibling
       of window.  In this case the lower command will insert window into the
       stacking order just below belowThis (or the ancestor of belowThis that is
       a sibling of window); this could end up either raising or lowering
       window.
