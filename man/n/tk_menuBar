DESCRIPTION
       These procedures were used in Tk 3.6 and earlier releases to help manage
       pulldown menus and to implement keyboard traversal of menus.  In Tk 4.0
       and later releases they are no longer needed.  Stubs for these procedures
       have been retained for backward compatibility, but they have no effect.
       You should remove calls to these procedures from your code, since
       eventually the procedures will go away.

       From Tk 8.0 onwards, you should instead construct your menubar as a
       normal menu and then attach it to the toplevel of your choice using the
       -menu option of that widget.
