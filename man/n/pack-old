DESCRIPTION
       Note: this manual entry describes the syntax for the pack command as it
       existed before Tk version 3.3.  Although this syntax continues to be
       supported for backward compatibility, it is obsolete and should not be
       used anymore.  At some point in the future it may cease to be supported.

       The packer is a geometry manager that arranges the children of a parent
       by packing them in order around the edges of the parent.  The first child
       is placed against one side of the window, occupying the entire span of
       the window along that side.  This reduces the space remaining for other
       children as if the side had been moved in by the size of the first child.
       Then the next child is placed against one side of the remaining cavity,
       and so on until all children have been placed or there is no space left
       in the cavity.

       The before, after, and append forms of the pack command are used to
       insert one or more children into the packing order for their parent.  The
       before form inserts the children before window sibling in the order;  all
       of the other windows must be siblings of sibling.  The after form inserts
       the windows after sibling, and the append form appends one or more
       windows to the end of the packing order for parent.  If a window named in
       any of these commands is already packed in its parent, it is removed from
       its current position in the packing order and repositioned as indicated
       by the command.  All of these commands return an empty string as result.

       The unpack form of the pack command removes window from the packing order
       of its parent and unmaps it.  After the execution of this command the
       packer will no longer manage window's geometry.

       The placement of each child is actually a four-step process; the options
       argument following each window consists of a list of one or more fields
       that govern the placement of that window.  In the discussion below, the
       term cavity refers to the space left in a parent when a particular child
       is placed (i.e. all the space that was not claimed by earlier children in
       the packing order).  The term parcel refers to the space allocated to a
       particular child;  this is not necessarily the same as the child window's
       final geometry.

       The first step in placing a child is to determine which side of the
       cavity it will lie against.  Any one of the following options may be used
       to specify a side:

       top    Position the child's parcel against the top of the cavity,
              occupying the full width of the cavity.

       bottom Position the child's parcel against the bottom of the cavity,
              occupying the full width of the cavity.

       left   Position the child's parcel against the left side of the cavity,
              occupying the full height of the cavity.

       right  Position the child's parcel against the right side of the cavity,
              occupying the full height of the cavity.

       At most one of these options should be specified for any given window.
       If no side is specified, then the default is top.

       The second step is to decide on a parcel for the child.  For top and
       bottom windows, the desired parcel width is normally the cavity width and
       the desired parcel height is the window's requested height, as passed to
       Tk_GeometryRequest. For left and right windows, the desired parcel height
       is normally the cavity height and the desired width is the window's
       requested width.  However, extra space may be requested for the window
       using any of the following options:

       padx num    Add num pixels to the window's requested width before
                   computing the parcel size as described above.

       pady num    Add num pixels to the window's requested height before
                   computing the parcel size as described above.

       expand      This option requests that the window's parcel absorb any
                   extra space left over in the parent's cavity after packing
                   all the children.  The amount of space left over depends on
                   the sizes requested by the other children, and may be zero.
                   If several windows have all specified expand then the extra
                   width will be divided equally among all the left and right
                   windows that specified expand and the extra height will be
                   divided equally among all the top and bottom windows that
                   specified expand.

       If the desired width or height for a parcel is larger than the
       corresponding dimension of the cavity, then the cavity's dimension is
       used instead.

       The third step in placing the window is to decide on the window's width
       and height.  The default is for the window to receive either its
       requested width and height or the those of the parcel, whichever is
       smaller.  If the parcel is larger than the window's requested size, then
       the following options may be used to expand the window to partially or
       completely fill the parcel:

       fill   Set the window's size to equal the parcel size.

       fillx  Increase the window's width to equal the parcel's width, but
              retain the window's requested height.

       filly  Increase the window's height to equal the parcel's height, but
              retain the window's requested width.

       The last step is to decide the window's location within its parcel.  If
       the window's size equals the parcel's size, then the window simply fills
       the entire parcel.  If the parcel is larger than the window, then one of
       the following options may be used to specify where the window should be
       positioned within its parcel:

       frame center   Center the window in its parcel.  This is the default if
                      no framing option is specified.

       frame n        Position the window with its top edge centered on the top
                      edge of the parcel.

       frame ne       Position the window with its upper-right corner at the
                      upper-right corner of the parcel.

       frame e        Position the window with its right edge centered on the
                      right edge of the parcel.

       frame se       Position the window with its lower-right corner at the
                      lower-right corner of the parcel.

       frame s        Position the window with its bottom edge centered on the
                      bottom edge of the parcel.

       frame sw       Position the window with its lower-left corner at the
                      lower-left corner of the parcel.

       frame w        Position the window with its left edge centered on the
                      left edge of the parcel.

       frame nw       Position the window with its upper-left corner at the
                      upper-left corner of the parcel.

       The packer manages the mapped/unmapped state of all the packed children
       windows.  It automatically maps the windows when it packs them, and it
       unmaps any windows for which there was no space left in the cavity.

       The packer makes geometry requests on behalf of the parent windows it
       manages.  For each parent window it requests a size large enough to
       accommodate all the options specified by all the packed children, such
       that zero space would be leftover for expand options.
