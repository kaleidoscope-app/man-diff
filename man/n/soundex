DESCRIPTION
       This package provides soundex algorithms which allow the comparison of
       words based on their phonetic likeness.

       Currently only an algorithm by Knuth is provided, which is tuned to
       english names and words.

       ::soundex::knuth string
              Computes the soundex code of the input string using Knuth's
              algorithm and returns it as the result of the command.

EXAMPLES

           % ::soundex::knuth Knuth
           K530
