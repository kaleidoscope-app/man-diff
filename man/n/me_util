DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a number of utility command for the conversion
       between the various representations of abstract syntax trees as specified
       in the document grammar::me_ast.

       ::grammar::me::util::ast2tree ast tree ?root?
              This command converts an ast from value to object representation.
              All nodes in the ast will be converted into nodes of this tree,
              with the root of the AST a child of the node root. If this node is
              not explicitly specified the root of the tree is used. Existing
              content of tree is not touched, i.e.  neither removed nor changed,
              with the exception of the specified root node, which will gain a
              new child.

       ::grammar::me::util::ast2etree ast mcmd tree ?root?
              This command is like ::grammar::me::util::ast2tree, except that
              the result is in the extended object representation of the input
              AST.  The source of the extended information is the command prefix
              mcmd.  It has to understand two methods, lc, and tok, with the
              semantics specified below.

              mcmd lc location
                     Takes the location of a token given as offset in the input
                     stream and return a 2-element list containing the
                     associated line number and column index, in this order.

              mcmd tok from ?to?
                     Takes one or two locations from and to as offset in the
                     input stream and returns a Tcl list containing the
                     specified part of the input stream. Both location are
                     inclusive. If to is not specified it will default to the
                     value of from.

                     Each element of the returned list is a list containing the
                     token, its associated lexeme, the line number, and column
                     index, in this order.

       Both the ensemble command ::grammar::me::tcl provided by the package
       grammar::me::tcl and the objects command created by the package
       ::grammar::me::cpu fit the above specification.

       ::grammar::me::util::tree2ast tree ?root?
              This command converts an ast in (extended) object representation
              into a value and returns it.  If a root node is specified the AST
              is generated from that node downward. Otherwise the root of the
              tree object is used as the starting point.
