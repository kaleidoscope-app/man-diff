DESCRIPTION
       The package textutil::trim provides commands that trim strings using
       arbitrary regular expressions.

       The complete set of procedures is described below.

       ::textutil::trim::trim string ?regexp?
              Remove in string any leading and trailing substring according to
              the regular expression regexp and return the result as a new
              string.  This is done for all lines in the string, that is any
              substring between 2 newline chars, or between the beginning of the
              string and a newline, or between a newline and the end of the
              string, or, if the string contain no newline, between the
              beginning and the end of the string.  The regular expression
              regexp defaults to "[ \\t]+".

       ::textutil::trim::trimleft string ?regexp?
              Remove in string any leading substring according to the regular
              expression regexp and return the result as a new string. This
              apply on any line in the string, that is any substring between 2
              newline chars, or between the beginning of the string and a
              newline, or between a newline and the end of the string, or, if
              the string contain no newline, between the beginning and the end
              of the string.  The regular expression regexp defaults to "[
              \\t]+".

       ::textutil::trim::trimright string ?regexp?
              Remove in string any trailing substring according to the regular
              expression regexp and return the result as a new string. This
              apply on any line in the string, that is any substring between 2
              newline chars, or between the beginning of the string and a
              newline, or between a newline and the end of the string, or, if
              the string contain no newline, between the beginning and the end
              of the string.  The regular expression regexp defaults to "[
              \\t]+".

       ::textutil::trim::trimPrefix string prefix
              Removes the prefix from the beginning of string and returns the
              result. The string is left unchanged if it doesn't have prefix at
              its beginning.

       ::textutil::trim::trimEmptyHeading string
              Looks for empty lines (including lines consisting of only
              whitespace) at the beginning of the string and removes it. The
              modified string is returned as the result of the command.
