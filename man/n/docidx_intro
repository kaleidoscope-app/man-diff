NAME
       docidx_intro - docidx introduction

DESCRIPTION
       docidx (short for documentation tables of contents) stands for a set of
       related, yet different, entities which are working together for the easy
       creation and transformation of keyword-based indices for documentation.
       These are

       [1]    A tcl based language for the semantic markup of a keyword index.
              Markup is represented by Tcl commands.

       [2]    A package providing the ability to read and transform texts
              written in that markup language. It is important to note that the
              actual transformation of the input text is delegated to plugins.

       [3]    An API describing the interface between the package above and a
              plugin.

       Which of the more detailed documents are relevant to the reader of this
       introduction depends on their role in the documentation process.

       [1]    A writer of documentation has to understand the markup language
              itself. A beginner to docidx should read the more informally
              written docidx language introduction first. Having digested this
              the formal docidx language syntax specification should become
              understandable. A writer experienced with docidx may only need the
              docidx language command reference from time to time to refresh her
              memory.

              While a document is written the dtp application can be used to
              validate it, and after completion it also performs the conversion
              into the chosen system of visual markup, be it *roff, HTML, plain
              text, wiki, etc. The simpler dtplite application makes internal
              use of docidx when handling directories of documentation,
              automatically generating a proper keyword index for them.

       [2]    A processor of documentation written in the docidx markup language
              has to know which tools are available for use.

              The main tool is the aforementioned dtp application provided by
              Tcllib. The simpler dtplite does not expose docidx to the user.
              At the bottom level, common to both applications, however sits the
              package doctoools::idx, providing the basic facilities to read and
              process files containing text in the docidx format.

       [3]    At last, but not least, plugin writers have to understand the
              interaction between the doctools::idx package and its plugins, as
              described in the docidx plugin API reference.

RELATED FORMATS
       docidx does not stand alone, it has two companion formats. These are
       called doctoc and doctools, and they are for the markup of tables of
       contents, and general documentation, respectively.  They are described in
       their own sets of documents, starting at the doctoc introduction and the
       doctools introduction, respectively.
