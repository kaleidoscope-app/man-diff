DESCRIPTION
OVERVIEW
   WHAT IS THIS DOCUMENT?
       This document is currently mainly a placeholder, to be filled with
       commonly asked questions about the doctoc markup language and companions,
       and their answers.

       Please report any questions (and, if possible, answers) we should
       consider for this document in the category doctools of the Tcllib SF
       Trackers [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].

EXAMPLES
   WHERE DO I FIND DOCTOC EXAMPLES?
       We have no direct examples of documents written using doctoc markup.
       However the doctools processor dtplite does generate a table of contents
       when processing a set of documents written in doctools markup. The
       intermediate file for it uses doctoc markup and is not deleted when
       generation completes. Such files can therefore serve as examples.

       dtplite is distributed as part of Tcllib, so to get it you need one of

       [1]    A CVS snapshot of Tcllib. How to retrieve such a snapshot and the
              tools required for this are described at
              http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=12883

       [2]    A Tcllib release archive. They are available at
              http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12883
