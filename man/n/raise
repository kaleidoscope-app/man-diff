raise(n)                      Tk Built-In Commands                      raise(n)



________________________________________________________________________________

NAME
       raise - Change a window's position in the stacking order

SYNOPSIS
       raise window ?aboveThis?
________________________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       If the aboveThis argument is omitted then the command raises window so
       that it is above all of its siblings in the stacking order (it will not
       be obscured by any siblings and will obscure any siblings that overlap
       it).  If aboveThis is specified then it must be the path name of a window
       that is either a sibling of window or the descendant of a sibling of
       window.  In this case the raise command will insert window into the
       stacking order just above aboveThis (or the ancestor of aboveThis that is
       a sibling of window); this could end up either raising or lowering
       window.

EXAMPLE
       Make a button appear to be in a sibling frame that was created after it.
       This is is often necessary when building GUIs in the style where you
       create your activity widgets first before laying them out on the display:
              button .b -text "Hi there!"
              pack [frame .f -background blue]
              pack [label .f.l1 -text "This is above"]
              pack .b -in .f
              pack [label .f.l2 -text "This is below"]
              raise .b
