NAME
       doctoc_intro - doctoc introduction

DESCRIPTION
       doctoc (short for documentation tables of contents) stands for a set of
       related, yet different, entities which are working together for the easy
       creation and transformation of tables of contents for documentation.
       These are

       [1]    A tcl based language for the semantic markup of a table of
              contents. Markup is represented by Tcl commands.

       [2]    A package providing the ability to read and transform texts
              written in that markup language. It is important to note that the
              actual transformation of the input text is delegated to plugins.

       [3]    An API describing the interface between the package above and a
              plugin.

       Which of the more detailed documents are relevant to the reader of this
       introduction depends on their role in the documentation process.

       [1]    A writer of documentation has to understand the markup language
              itself. A beginner to doctoc should read the more informally
              written doctoc language introduction first. Having digested this
              the formal doctoc language syntax specification should become
              understandable. A writer experienced with doctoc may only need the
              doctoc language command reference from time to time to refresh her
              memory.

              While a document is written the dtp application can be used to
              validate it, and after completion it also performs the conversion
              into the chosen system of visual markup, be it *roff, HTML, plain
              text, wiki, etc. The simpler dtplite application makes internal
              use of doctoc when handling directories of documentation,
              automatically generating a proper table of contents for them.

       [2]    A processor of documentation written in the doctoc markup language
              has to know which tools are available for use.

              The main tool is the aforementioned dtp application provided by
              Tcllib. The simpler dtplite does not expose doctoc to the user.
              At the bottom level, common to both applications, however sits the
              package doctoools::toc, providing the basic facilities to read and
              process files containing text in the doctoc format.

       [3]    At last, but not least, plugin writers have to understand the
              interaction between the doctools::toc package and its plugins, as
              described in the doctoc plugin API reference.

RELATED FORMATS
       doctoc does not stand alone, it has two companion formats. These are
       called docidx and doctools, and they are for the markup of keyword
       indices, and general documentation, respectively.  They are described in
       their own sets of documents, starting at the docidx introduction and the
       doctools introduction, respectively.
