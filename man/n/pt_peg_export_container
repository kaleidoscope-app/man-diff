DESCRIPTION
       Are you lost ?  Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In
       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to Parser
       Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the current
       package is a part of.

       This package implements the parsing expression grammar export plugin for
       the generation of CONTAINER markup.

       It resides in the Export section of the Core Layer of Parser Tools and is
       intended to be used by pt::peg::export, the export manager, sitting
       between it and the corresponding core conversion functionality provided
       by pt::peg::to::container.

       IMAGE: arch_core_eplugins

       While the direct use of this package with a regular interpreter is
       possible, this is strongly disrecommended and requires a number of
       contortions to provide the expected environment.  The proper way to use
       this functionality depends on the situation:

       [1]    In an untrusted environment the proper access is through the
              package pt::peg::export and the export manager objects it
              provides.

       [2]    In a trusted environment however simply use the package
              pt::peg::to::container and access the core conversion
              functionality directly.

API
       The API provided by this package satisfies the specification of the
       Plugin API found in the Parser Tools Export API specification.

       export serial configuration
              This command takes the canonical serialization of a parsing
              expression grammar, as specified in section PEG serialization
              format, and contained in serial, the configuration, a dictionary,
              and generates CONTAINER markup encoding the grammar.  The created
              string is then returned as the result of the command.

CONFIGURATION
       The CONTAINER export plugin recognizes the following configuration
       variables and changes its behaviour as they specify.

       enum mode
              The value of this configuration variable controls which methods of
              pt::peg instances the plugin will use to specify the grammar.
              There are two legal values

              bulk   In this mode the methods start, add, modes, and rules are
                     used to specify the grammar in a bulk manner, i.e. as a set
                     of nonterminal symbols, and two dictionaries mapping from
                     the symbols to their semantic modes and parsing
                     expressions.

                     This mode is the default.

              incremental
                     In this mode the methods start, add, mode, and rule are
                     used to specify the grammar piecemal, with each nonterminal
                     having its own block of defining commands.

       string template
              If this configuration variable is set it is assumed to contain a
              string into which to put the generated code and other
              configuration data. The various locations are expected to be
              specified with the following placeholders:

              @user@ To be replaced with the value of the configuration variable
                     user.

              @format@
                     To be replaced with the the constant CONTAINER.

              @file@ To be replaced with the value of the configuration variable
                     file.

              @name@ To be replaced with the value of the configuration variable
                     name.

              @mode@ To be replaced with the value of the configuration variable
                     mode.

              @code@ To be replaced with the generated code.

       If this configuration variable is not set, or empty, then the plugin
       falls back to a standard template, which is defined as "@code@".

       Note that this plugin may ignore the standard configuration variables
       user, format, file, and their values, depending on the chosen template.

       The content of the standard configuration variable name, if set, is used
       as name of the grammar in the output. Otherwise the plugin falls back to
       the default name a_pe_grammar.

GRAMMAR CONTAINER
       The container format is another form of describing parsing expression
       grammars. While data in this format is executable it does not constitute
       a parser for the grammar. It always has to be used in conjunction with
       the package pt::peg::interp, a grammar interpreter.

       The format represents grammars by a snit::type, i.e. class, whose
       instances are API-compatible to the instances of the pt::peg::container
       package, and which are preloaded with the grammar in question.

       It has no direct formal specification beyond what was said above.

   EXAMPLE
       Assuming the following PEG for simple mathematical expressions


       PEG calculator (Expression)
           Digit      <- '0'/'1'/'2'/'3'/'4'/'5'/'6'/'7'/'8'/'9'   ;
           Sign       <- '-' / '+'                       ;
           Number     <- Sign? Digit+                         ;
           Expression <- '(' Expression ')' / (Factor (MulOp Factor)*)  ;
           MulOp      <- '*' / '/'                       ;
           Factor     <- Term (AddOp Term)*                   ;
           AddOp      <- '+'/'-'                         ;
           Term       <- Number                     ;
       END;


       one possible CONTAINER serialization for it is


       snit::type a_pe_grammar {
           constructor {} {
               install myg using pt::peg::container ${selfns}::G

               }
               $myg rules {
                   AddOp      {/ {t -} {t +}}
                   Digit      {/ {t 0} {t 1} {t 2} {t 3} {t 4} {t 5} {t 6} {t 7} {t 8} {t 9}}
                   Expression {/ {x {t \50} {n Expression} {t \51}} {x {n Factor} {* {x {n MulOp} {n Factor}}}}}
                   Factor     {x {n Term} {* {x {n AddOp} {n Term}}}}
                   MulOp      {/ {t *} {t /}}
                   Number     {x {? {n Sign}} {+ {n Digit}}}
                   Sign       {/ {t -} {t +}}
                   Term       {n Number}
               }
               return
           }

           component myg
           delegate method * to myg
       }


PEG SERIALIZATION FORMAT
       Here we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize Parsing
       Expression Grammars as immutable values for transport, comparison, etc.

       We distinguish between regular and canonical serializations.  While a PEG
       may have more than one regular serialization only exactly one of them
       will be canonical.

       regular serialization

              [1]    The serialization of any PEG is a nested Tcl dictionary.

              [2]    This dictionary holds a single key, pt::grammar::peg, and
                     its value. This value holds the contents of the grammar.

              [3]    The contents of the grammar are a Tcl dictionary holding
                     the set of nonterminal symbols and the starting expression.
                     The relevant keys and their values are

                     rules  The value is a Tcl dictionary whose keys are the
                            names of the nonterminal symbols known to the
                            grammar.

                            [1]    Each nonterminal symbol may occur only once.

                            [2]    The empty string is not a legal nonterminal
                                   symbol.

                            [3]    The value for each symbol is a Tcl dictionary
                                   itself. The relevant keys and their values in
                                   this dictionary are

                                   is     The value is the serialization of the
                                          parsing expression describing the
                                          symbols sentennial structure, as
                                          specified in the section PE
                                          serialization format.

                                   mode   The value can be one of three values
                                          specifying how a parser should handle
                                          the semantic value produced by the
                                          symbol.

                                          value  The semantic value of the
                                                 nonterminal symbol is an
                                                 abstract syntax tree consisting
                                                 of a single node node for the
                                                 nonterminal itself, which has
                                                 the ASTs of the symbol's right
                                                 hand side as its children.

                                          leaf   The semantic value of the
                                                 nonterminal symbol is an
                                                 abstract syntax tree consisting
                                                 of a single node node for the
                                                 nonterminal, without any
                                                 children. Any ASTs generated by
                                                 the symbol's right hand side
                                                 are discarded.

                                          void   The nonterminal has no semantic
                                                 value. Any ASTs generated by
                                                 the symbol's right hand side
                                                 are discarded (as well).

                     start  The value is the serialization of the start parsing
                            expression of the grammar, as specified in the
                            section PE serialization format.

              [4]    The terminal symbols of the grammar are specified
                     implicitly as the set of all terminal symbols used in the
                     start expression and on the RHS of the grammar rules.

       canonical serialization
              The canonical serialization of a grammar has the format as
              specified in the previous item, and then additionally satisfies
              the constraints below, which make it unique among all the possible
              serializations of this grammar.

              [1]    The keys found in all the nested Tcl dictionaries are
                     sorted in ascending dictionary order, as generated by Tcl's
                     builtin command lsort -increasing -dict.

              [2]    The string representation of the value is the canonical
                     representation of a Tcl dictionary. I.e. it does not
                     contain superfluous whitespace.

   EXAMPLE
       Assuming the following PEG for simple mathematical expressions


       PEG calculator (Expression)
           Digit      <- '0'/'1'/'2'/'3'/'4'/'5'/'6'/'7'/'8'/'9'   ;
           Sign       <- '-' / '+'                       ;
           Number     <- Sign? Digit+                         ;
           Expression <- '(' Expression ')' / (Factor (MulOp Factor)*)  ;
           MulOp      <- '*' / '/'                       ;
           Factor     <- Term (AddOp Term)*                   ;
           AddOp      <- '+'/'-'                         ;
           Term       <- Number                     ;
       END;


       then its canonical serialization (except for whitespace) is


       pt::grammar::peg {
           rules {
            AddOp      {is {/ {t -} {t +}}                                                                mode value}
            Digit      {is {/ {t 0} {t 1} {t 2} {t 3} {t 4} {t 5} {t 6} {t 7} {t 8} {t 9}}                mode value}
            Expression {is {/ {x {t (} {n Expression} {t )}} {x {n Factor} {* {x {n MulOp} {n Factor}}}}} mode value}
            Factor     {is {x {n Term} {* {x {n AddOp} {n Term}}}}                                        mode value}
            MulOp      {is {/ {t *} {t /}}                                                                mode value}
            Number     {is {x {? {n Sign}} {+ {n Digit}}}                                                 mode value}
            Sign       {is {/ {t -} {t +}}                                                                mode value}
            Term       {is  {n Number}                                                                    mode value}
           }
           start {n Expression}
       }


PE SERIALIZATION FORMAT
       Here we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize Parsing
       Expressions as immutable values for transport, comparison, etc.

       We distinguish between regular and canonical serializations.  While a
       parsing expression may have more than one regular serialization only
       exactly one of them will be canonical.

              Atomic Parsing Expressions

                     [1]    The string epsilon is an atomic parsing expression.
                            It matches the empty string.

                     [2]    The string dot is an atomic parsing expression. It
                            matches any character.

                     [3]    The string alnum is an atomic parsing expression. It
                            matches any Unicode alphabet or digit character.
                            This is a custom extension of PEs based on Tcl's
                            builtin command string is.

                     [4]    The string alpha is an atomic parsing expression. It
                            matches any Unicode alphabet character. This is a
                            custom extension of PEs based on Tcl's builtin
                            command string is.

                     [5]    The string ascii is an atomic parsing expression. It
                            matches any Unicode character below U0080. This is a
                            custom extension of PEs based on Tcl's builtin
                            command string is.

                     [6]    The string control is an atomic parsing expression.
                            It matches any Unicode control character. This is a
                            custom extension of PEs based on Tcl's builtin
                            command string is.

                     [7]    The string digit is an atomic parsing expression. It
                            matches any Unicode digit character. Note that this
                            includes characters outside of the [0..9] range.
                            This is a custom extension of PEs based on Tcl's
                            builtin command string is.

                     [8]    The string graph is an atomic parsing expression. It

              Combined Parsing Expressions

                     [1]    For parsing expressions e1, e2, ... the result of
                            [list / e1 e2 ... ] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the ordered choice, aka prioritized choice.

                     [2]    For parsing expressions e1, e2, ... the result of
                            [list x e1 e2 ... ] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the sequence.

                     [3]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list * e]
                            is a parsing expression as well.  This is the kleene
                            closure, describing zero or more repetitions.

                     [4]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list + e]
                            is a parsing expression as well.  This is the
                            positive kleene closure, describing one or more
                            repetitions.

                     [5]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list & e]
                            is a parsing expression as well.  This is the and
                            lookahead predicate.

                     [6]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list ! e]
                            is a parsing expression as well.  This is the not
                            lookahead predicate.

                     [7]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list ? e]
                            is a parsing expression as well.  This is the
                            optional input.

       Canonical serialization
              The canonical serialization of a parsing expression has the format
              as specified in the previous item, and then additionally satisfies
              the constraints below, which make it unique among all the possible
              serializations of this parsing expression.

              [1]    The string representation of the value is the canonical
                     representation of a pure Tcl list. I.e. it does not contain
                     superfluous whitespace.

              [2]    Terminals are not encoded as ranges (where start and end of
                     the range are identical).

   EXAMPLE
       Assuming the parsing expression shown on the right-hand side of the rule


           Expression <- '(' Expression ')'
                       / Factor (MulOp Factor)*


       then its canonical serialization (except for whitespace) is


           {/ {x {t (} {n Expression} {t )}} {x {n Factor} {* {x {n MulOp} {n Factor}}}}}
