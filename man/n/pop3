DESCRIPTION
       The pop3 package provides a simple Tcl-only client library for the POP3
       email protocol as specified in RFC 1939 [http://www.rfc-
       editor.org/rfc/rfc1939.txt].  It works by opening the standard POP3
       socket on the server, transmitting the username and password, then
       providing a Tcl API to access the POP3 protocol commands.  All server
       errors are returned as Tcl errors (thrown) which must be caught with the
       Tcl catch command.

API
       ::pop3::open ?-msex 0|1? ?-retr-mode retr|list|slow? ?-socketcmd
       cmdprefix? host username password ?port?
              Open a socket connection to the server specified by host, transmit
              the username and password as login information to the server.  The
              default port number is 110, which can be overridden using the
              optional port argument.  The return value is a channel used by all
              of the other ::pop3 functions.

              The command recognizes three options

              -msex boolean
                     Setting this option tells the package that the server we
                     are talking to is an MS Exchange server (which has some
                     oddities we have to work around). The default is False.

              -retr-mode retr|list|slow
                     The retrieval mode determines how exactly messages are read
                     from the server.  The allowed values are retr, list and
                     slow.  The default is retr. See ::pop3::retrieve for more
                     information.

              -socketcmd cmdprefix
                     This option allows the user to overide the use of the
                     builtin socket command with any API-compatible command. The
                     envisioned main use is the securing of the new connection
                     via SSL, through the specification of the command
                     tls::socket. This command is specially recognized as well,
                     changing the default port of the connection to 995.

       ::pop3::config chan
              Returns the configuration of the pop3 connection identified by the
              channel handle chan as a serialized array.

       ::pop3::status chan
              Query the server for the status of the mail spool.  The status is
              returned as a list containing two elements, the first is the
              number of email messages on the server and the second is the size
              (in octets, 8 byte blocks) of the entire mail spool.

       ::pop3::last chan
              Query the server for the last email message read from the spool.
              This value includes all messages read from all clients connecting
              to the login account.  This command may not be supported by the
              email server, in which case the server may return 0 or an error.

       ::pop3::retrieve chan startIndex ?endIndex?
              Retrieve a range of messages from the server.  If the endIndex is
              not specified, only one message will be retrieved.  The return
              value is a list containing each message as a separate element.
              See the startIndex and endIndex descriptions below.

              The retrieval mode determines how exactly messages are read from
              the server. The mode retr assumes that the RETR command delivers
              the size of the message as part of the command status and uses
              this to read the message efficiently. In mode list RETR does not
              deliver the size, but the LIST command does and we use this to
              retrieve the message size before the actual retrieval, which can
              then be done efficiently. In the last mode, slow, the system is
              unable to obtain the size of the message to retrieve in any manner
              and falls back to reading the message from the server line by
              line.

              It should also be noted that the system checks upon the configured
              mode and falls back to the slower modes if the above assumptions
              are not true.

       ::pop3::delete chan startIndex ?endIndex?
              Delete a range of messages from the server.  If the endIndex is
              not specified, only one message will be deleted.  Note, the
              indices are not reordered on the server, so if you delete message
              1, then the first message in the queue is message 2 (message index
              1 is no longer valid).  See the startIndex and endIndex
              descriptions below.

              startIndex
                     The startIndex may be an index of a specific message
                     starting with the index 1, or it have any of the following
                     values:

                     start  This is a logical value for the first message in the
                            spool, equivalent to the value 1.

                     next   The message immediately following the last message
                            read, see ::pop3::last.

                     end    The most recent message in the spool (the end of the
                            spool).  This is useful to retrieve only the most
                            recent message.

              endIndex
                     The endIndex is an optional parameter and defaults to the
                     value "-1", which indicates to only retrieve the one
                     message specified by startIndex.  If specified, it may be
                     an index of a specific message starting with the index "1",
                     or it may have any of the following values:

                     last   The message is the last message read by a POP3
                            client, see ::pop3::last.

                     end    The most recent message in the spool (the end of the
                            spool).

       ::pop3::list chan ?msg?
              Returns the scan listing of the mailbox. If parameter msg is
              given, then the listing only for that message is returned.

       ::pop3::top chan msg n
              Optional POP3 command, not all servers may support this.
              ::pop3::top retrieves headers of a message, specified by parameter
              msg, and number of n lines from the message body.

       ::pop3::uidl chan ?msg?
              Optional POP3 command, not all servers may support this.
              ::pop3::uidl returns the uid listing of the mailbox. If the
              parameter msg is specified, then the listing only for that message
              is returned.

       ::pop3::close chan
              Gracefully close the connect after sending a POP3 QUIT command
              down the socket.

SECURE MAIL TRANSFER
       A pop3 connection can be secured with SSL/TLS by requiring the package
       TLS and then using the option -socketcmd of the command pop3::open to
       force the use of the tls::socket command when opening the connection.

            package require tls
            tls::init -cafile /path/to/ca/cert -keyfile ...

            # Create secured pop3 channel
            pop3::open -socketcmd tls::socket \\
                 $thehost $theuser $thepassword

            ...
