WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       Name:           childSitePos
       Class:          Position
       Command-Line Switch:           -childsitepos

              Specifies the position of the child site in the date field: n, s,
              e, or w.  The default is e.

       Name:           command
       Class:          Command
       Command-Line Switch:           -command

              Specifies a Tcl command to be executed upon detection of a Return
              key press event.

       Name:           gmt
       Class:          GMT
       Command-Line Switch:           -gmt

              Determines whether the date is calculated relative to Greenwich
              Mean Time. Accepts a boolean value. The default is no.

       Name:           int
       Class:          DateFormat
       Command-Line Switch:           -int

              Used to specify international date formats.  This option must be a
              boolean value.  When set to true, the date is formatted as YYYY-
              MM-DD.  When set to false, it is formatted as MM/DD/YYYY.  Note
              that this format is driven by the 'clock scan' command and that
              YYYY-MM-DD is supported in Tk 8.4 or later.  The default is no.

       Name:           iq
       Class:          Iq
       Command-Line Switch:           -iq

              Specifies the level of intelligence to be shown in the actions
              taken by the datefield during the processing of keypress events.
              Valid settings include high, average, and low.  With a high iq,the
              date prevents the user from typing in an invalid date.  For
              example, if the current date is 05/31/1997 and the user changes
              the month to 04, then the day will be instantly modified for them
              to be 30.  In addition, leap years are fully taken into account.
              With average iq, the month is limited to the values of 01-12, but
              it is possible to type in an invalid day.  A setting of low iq
              instructs the widget to do no validity checking at all during date
              entry.  With both average and low iq levels, it is assumed that
              the validity will be determined at a later time using the date's
              isvalid command.

       Name:           state
       Class:          State
       Command-Line Switch:           -state

              Specifies one of two states for the datefield: normal or disabled.
              If the datefield is disabled then input is not accepted.  The
              default is normal.

       Name:           textBackground
       Class:          Background
       Command-Line Switch:           -textbackground

              Background color for inside textual portion of the entry field.
              The value may be given in any of the forms acceptable to
              Tk_GetColor.

       Name:           textFont
       Class:          Font
       Command-Line Switch:           -textfont

              Name of font to use for display of text in datefield.  The value
              may be given in any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetFont.

DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::datefield command creates an enhanced text entry widget for
       the purpose of date entry with various degrees of built-in intelligence.



METHODS
       The iwidgets::datefield command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
       pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
       widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following commands are possible for datefield widgets:

WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::datefield command.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::datefield command.

       pathName get ?format?
              Returns the current contents of the datefield in a format of
              string or as an integer clock value using the -string and -clicks
              format options respectively.  The default is by string.  Reference
              the clock command for more information on obtaining dates and
              their formats.

       pathName isvalid
              Returns a boolean indication of the validity of the currently
              displayed date value.  For example, 03/03/1960 is valid whereas
              02/29/1997 is invalid.

       pathName show date
              Changes the currently displayed date to be that of the date
              argument.  The date may be specified either as a string, an
              integer clock value or the keyword "now".  Reference the clock
              command for more information on obtaining dates and their formats.


COMPONENTS
       Name:           date
       Class:          Entry

              The date component provides the entry field for date input and
              display.  See the "entry" widget manual entry for details on the
              date component item.

               }

               iwidgets::datefield .df -command returnCmd
