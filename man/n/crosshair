DESCRIPTION
       The crosshair package provides commands to (de)activate and track
       crosshairs on canvas widgets.

API
       The following commands are exported to the public:

       crosshair::crosshair w ?arg...?
              This command activates the display of a pair of cross-hairs for
              the canvas widget w. The cross-hairs track the pointing device.
              The result of the command is the empty string.

              All arguments after the widget w are treated as options as for a
              canvas line item in w. Of particular interest are -fill and -dash.

       crosshair::off w
              This command removes the cross-hairs from the canvas widget w.
              Nothing is done if the widget had no cross-hairs. The result of
              the command is the empty string.

       crosshair::configure w ?arg...?
              This command changes the appearance of the cross-hairs in the
              canvas widget w. It is an error to call it for a canvas which has
              no cross-hairs.

              All arguments after the widget w are treated as options as for a
              canvas line item in w. Of particular interest are -fill and -dash.

              The result of the command are the current configuration settings.

       crosshair::track on w cmdprefix
              This command activates reporting of the location of the cross-
              hairs in the canvas widget w. It is an error to use this command
              for a canvas which has no cross-hairs. The result of the command
              is the empty string.

              After the invokation of this command the specified command prefix
              cmdprefix will be called whenever the mouse moves within the
              canvas, with 7 arguments. These are, in order:

              [1]    The widget w

              [2]    The x-location of the cross-hairs, in pixels.

              [3]    The y-location of the cross-hairs, in pixels.

              [4]    The x-location of the top-left corner of the viewport, in
                     pixels.

              [5]    The y-location of the top-left corner of the viewport, in
                     pixels.

              [6]    The x-location of the bottom-right corner of the viewport,
                     in pixels.

              [7]    The y-location of the bottom-right corner of the viewport,
                     in pixels.
       A previously existing callback for w will be disabled. I.e. per canvas
       widget with cross-hairs only one callback reporting their location is
       possible.

       crosshair::track off w
              This command disables the reporting of the location of the cross-
              hairs in the canvas widget w. It is an error to use this command
              for a canvas which has no cross-hairs. The result of the command
              is the empty string.
