WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       [-bigincrement bigIncrement] Some interactions with the scale cause its
       value to change by “large” increments;  this option specifies the size of
       the large increments.  If specified as 0, the large increments default to
       1/10 the range of the scale.  [-command command] Specifies the prefix of
       a Tcl command to invoke whenever the scale's value is changed via a
       widget command.  The actual command consists of this option followed by a
       space and a real number indicating the new value of the scale.
       [-digits digits] An integer specifying how many significant digits should
       be retained when converting the value of the scale to a string.  If the
       number is less than or equal to zero, then the scale picks the smallest
       value that guarantees that every possible slider position prints as a
       different string.  [-from from] A real value corresponding to the left or
       top end of the scale.  [-label label] A string to display as a label for
       the scale.  For vertical scales the label is displayed just to the right
       of the top end of the scale.  For horizontal scales the label is
       displayed just above the left end of the scale.  If the option is
       specified as an empty string, no label is displayed.  [-length length]
       Specifies the desired long dimension of the scale in screen units (i.e.
       any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels).  For vertical scales this
       is the scale's height;  for horizontal scales it is the scale's width.
       [-resolution resolution] A real value specifying the resolution for the
       scale.  If this value is greater than zero then the scale's value will
       always be rounded to an even multiple of this value, as will tick marks
       and the endpoints of the scale.  If the value is less than zero then no
       rounding occurs.  Defaults to 1 (i.e., the value will be integral).
       [-showvalue showValue] Specifies a boolean value indicating whether or
       not the current value of the scale is to be displayed.
       [-sliderlength sliderLength] Specifies the size of the slider, measured
       in screen units along the slider's long dimension.  The value may be
       specified in any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.
       [-sliderrelief sliderRelief] Specifies the relief to use when drawing the
       slider, such as raised or sunken.  [-state state] Specifies one of three
       states for the scale:  normal, active, or disabled.  If the scale is
       disabled then the value may not be changed and the scale will not
       activate.  If the scale is active, the slider is displayed using the
       color specified by the activeBackground option.
       [-tickinterval tickInterval] Must be a real value.  Determines the
       spacing between numerical tick marks displayed below or to the left of
       the slider.  If 0, no tick marks will be displayed.  [-to to] Specifies a
       real value corresponding to the right or bottom end of the scale.  This
       value may be either less than or greater than the from option.
       [-variable variable] Specifies the name of a global variable to link to
       the scale.  Whenever the value of the variable changes, the scale will
       update to reflect this value.  Whenever the scale is manipulated
       interactively, the variable will be modified to reflect the scale's new
       value.  [-width width] Specifies the desired narrow dimension of the
       trough in screen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to
       Tk_GetPixels).  For vertical scales this is the trough's width;  for
       horizontal scales this is the trough's height.

DESCRIPTION
       The scale command creates a new window (given by the pathName argument)
       and makes it into a scale widget.  Additional options, described above,
       may be specified on the command line or in the option database to
       configure aspects of the scale such as its colors, orientation, and
       relief.  The scale command returns its pathName argument.  At the time
       this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named pathName,
       but pathName's parent must exist.

       A scale is a widget that displays a rectangular trough and a small
       slider.  The trough corresponds to a range of real values (determined by
       the from, to, and resolution options), and the position of the slider
       selects a particular real value.  The slider's position (and hence the
       scale's value) may be adjusted with the mouse or keyboard as described in
       the BINDINGS section below.  Whenever the scale's value is changed, a Tcl
       command is invoked (using the command option) to notify other interested
       widgets of the change.  In addition, the value of the scale can be linked
       to a Tcl variable (using the variable option), so that changes in either
       are reflected in the other.

       Three annotations may be displayed in a scale widget:  a label appearing
       at the top right of the widget (top left for horizontal scales), a number
       displayed just to the left of the slider (just above the slider for
       horizontal scales), and a collection of numerical tick marks just to the
       left of the current value (just below the trough for horizontal scales).
       Each of these three annotations may be enabled or disabled using the
       configuration options.

WIDGET COMMAND
       The scale command creates a new Tcl command whose name is pathName.  This
       command may be used to invoke various operations on the widget.  It has
       the following general form:
              pathName option ?arg arg ...?
       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following commands are possible for scale widgets:

       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the scale
              command.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the scale command.

       pathName coords ?value?
              Returns a list whose elements are the x and y coordinates of the
              point along the centerline of the trough that corresponds to
              value.  If value is omitted then the scale's current value is
              used.

       pathName get ?x y?
              If x and y are omitted, returns the current value of the scale.
              If x and y are specified, they give pixel coordinates within the
              widget;  the command returns the scale value corresponding to the
              given pixel.  Only one of x or y is used:  for horizontal scales y
              is ignored, and for vertical scales x is ignored.

       pathName identify x y
              Returns a string indicating what part of the scale lies under the
              coordinates given by x and y.  A return value of slider means that
              the point is over the slider;  trough1 means that the point is
              over the portion of the slider above  or to the left of the
              slider; and trough2 means that the point is over the portion of
              the slider below or to the right of the slider.  If the point is
              not over one of these elements, an empty string is returned.

       pathName set value
              This command is invoked to change the current value of the scale,
              and hence the position at which the slider is displayed.  Value
              gives the new value for the scale.  The command has no effect if
              the scale is disabled.

BINDINGS
       Tk automatically creates class bindings for scales that give them the
       following default behavior.  Where the behavior is different for vertical
       and horizontal scales, the horizontal behavior is described in
       parentheses.

       [1]    If button 1 is pressed in the trough, the scale's value will be
              incremented or decremented by the value of the resolution option
              so that the slider moves in the direction of the cursor.  If the
              button is held down, the action auto-repeats.

       [2]    If button 1 is pressed over the slider, the slider can be dragged
              with the mouse.

       [3]    If button 1 is pressed in the trough with the Control key down,
              the slider moves all the way to the end of its range, in the
              direction towards the mouse cursor.

       [4]    If button 2 is pressed, the scale's value is set to the mouse
              position.  If the mouse is dragged with button 2 down, the scale's
              value changes with the drag.

       [5]    The Up and Left keys move the slider up (left) by the value of the
              resolution option.

       [6]    The Down and Right keys move the slider down (right) by the value
              of the resolution option.

       [7]    Control-Up and Control-Left move the slider up (left) by the value
              of the bigIncrement option.

       [8]    Control-Down and Control-Right move the slider down (right) by the
              value of the bigIncrement option.

       [9]    Home moves the slider to the top (left) end of its range.

       [10]   End moves the slider to the bottom (right) end of its range.

       If the scale is disabled using the state option then none of the above
       bindings have any effect.

       The behavior of scales can be changed by defining new bindings for
       individual widgets or by redefining the class bindings.
