DESCRIPTION
       tk_focusNext is a utility procedure used for keyboard traversal.  It
       returns the “next” window after window in focus order. The focus order is
       determined by the stacking order of windows and the structure of the
       window hierarchy.  Among siblings, the focus order is the same as the
       stacking order, with the lowest window being first.  If a window has
       children, the window is visited first, followed by its children
       (recursively), followed by its next sibling.  Top-level windows other
       than window are skipped, so that tk_focusNext never returns a window in a
       different top-level from window.

       After computing the next window, tk_focusNext examines the window's
       -takefocus option to see whether it should be skipped.  If so,
       tk_focusNext continues on to the next window in the focus order, until it
       eventually finds a window that will accept the focus or returns back to
       window.

       tk_focusPrev is similar to tk_focusNext except that it returns the window
       just before window in the focus order.

       tk_focusFollowsMouse changes the focus model for the application to an
       implicit one where the window under the mouse gets the focus.  After this
       procedure is called, whenever the mouse enters a window Tk will
       automatically give it the input focus.  The focus command may be used to
       move the focus to a window other than the one under the mouse, but as
       soon as the mouse moves into a new window the focus will jump to that
       window.  Note: at present there is no built-in support for returning the
       application to an explicit focus model;  to do this you will have to
       write a script that deletes the bindings created by tk_focusFollowsMouse.
