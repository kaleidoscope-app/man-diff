DESCRIPTION
       Are you lost ?  Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In
       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to Parser
       Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the current
       package is a part of.

       This package provides additional commands to work with the serializations
       of parsing expressions as managed by the PEG and related packages, and
       specified in section PE serialization format.

       This is an internal package, for use by the higher level packages
       handling PEGs, their conversion into and out of various other formats, or
       other uses.

API
       ::pt::pe::op drop dropset pe
              This command removes all occurences of any of the nonterminals
              symbols in the set dropset from the parsing expression pe, and
              simplifies it. This may result in the expression becoming
              "epsilon", i.e. matching nothing.

       ::pt::pe::op rename nt ntnew pe
              This command renames all occurences of the nonterminal nt in the
              parsing expression pe into ntnew.

       ::pt::pe::op called pe
              This command extracts the set of all nonterminal symbols used,
              i.e. 'called', in the parsing expression pe.

       ::pt::pe::op flatten pe
              This command transforms the parsing expression by eliminating
              sequences nested in sequences, and choices in choices, lifting the
              children of the nested expression into the parent. It further
              eliminates all sequences and choices with only one child, as these
              are redundant.

              The resulting parsing expression is returned as the result of the
              command.

       ::pt::pe::op fusechars pe
              This command transforms the parsing expression by fusing adjacent
              terminals in sequences and adjacent terminals and ranges in
              choices, it (re)constructs highlevel strings and character
              classes.

              The resulting pseudo-parsing expression is returned as the result
              of the command and may contain the pseudo-operators str for
              character sequences, aka strings, and cl for character choices,
              aka character classes.

              The result is called a pseudo-parsing expression because it is not
              a true parsing expression anymore, and will fail a check with
              ::pt::peg verify if the new pseudo-operators are present in the
              result, but is otherwise of sound structure for a parsing
              expression.  Notably, the commands ::pt::peg bottomup and
              ::pt::peg topdown will process them without trouble.

PE SERIALIZATION FORMAT
       Here we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize Parsing
       Expressions as immutable values for transport, comparison, etc.

       We distinguish between regular and canonical serializations.  While a
       parsing expression may have more than one regular serialization only
       exactly one of them will be canonical.

              Combined Parsing Expressions

                     [1]    For parsing expressions e1, e2, ... the result of
                            [list / e1 e2 ... ] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the ordered choice, aka prioritized choice.

                     [2]    For parsing expressions e1, e2, ... the result of
                            [list x e1 e2 ... ] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the sequence.

                     [3]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list * e]
                            is a parsing expression as well.  This is the kleene
                            closure, describing zero or more repetitions.

                     [4]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list + e]
                            is a parsing expression as well.  This is the
                            positive kleene closure, describing one or more
                            repetitions.

                     [5]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list & e]
                            is a parsing expression as well.  This is the and
                            lookahead predicate.

                     [6]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list ! e]
                            is a parsing expression as well.  This is the not
                            lookahead predicate.

                     [7]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list ? e]
                            is a parsing expression as well.  This is the
                            optional input.

       Canonical serialization
              The canonical serialization of a parsing expression has the format
              as specified in the previous item, and then additionally satisfies
              the constraints below, which make it unique among all the possible
              serializations of this parsing expression.

              [1]    The string representation of the value is the canonical
                     representation of a pure Tcl list. I.e. it does not contain
                     superfluous whitespace.

              [2]    Terminals are not encoded as ranges (where start and end of
                     the range are identical).

   EXAMPLE
       Assuming the parsing expression shown on the right-hand side of the rule


           Expression <- '(' Expression ')'
                       / Factor (MulOp Factor)*


       then its canonical serialization (except for whitespace) is


           {/ {x {t (} {n Expression} {t )}} {x {n Factor} {* {x {n MulOp} {n Factor}}}}}
