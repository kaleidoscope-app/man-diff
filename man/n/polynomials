DESCRIPTION
       This package deals with polynomial functions of one variable:

       •      the basic arithmetic operations are extended to polynomials

       •      computing the derivatives and primitives of these functions

       •      evaluation through a general procedure or via specific procedures)

PROCEDURES
       The package defines the following public procedures:

       ::math::polynomials::polynomial coeffs
              Return an (encoded) list that defines the polynomial. A polynomial

                 f(x) = a + b.x + c.x**2 + d.x**3

              can be defined via:

                 set f [::math::polynomials::polynomial [list $a $b $c $d]


              list coeffs
                     Coefficients of the polynomial (in ascending order)


       ::math::polynomials::polynCmd coeffs
              Create a new procedure that evaluates the polynomial. The name of
              the polynomial is automatically generated. Useful if you need to
              evualuate the polynomial many times, as the procedure consists of
              a single [expr] command.

              list coeffs
                     Coefficients of the polynomial (in ascending order) or the
                     polynomial definition returned by the polynomial command.


       ::math::polynomials::evalPolyn polynomial x
              Evaluate the polynomial at x.

              list polynomial
                     The polynomial's definition (as returned by the polynomial
                     command).  order)

              float x
                     The coordinate at which to evaluate the polynomial


       ::math::polynomials::addPolyn polyn1 polyn2
              Return a new polynomial which is the sum of the two others.

              list polyn1
                     The first polynomial operand

              list polyn2
                     The second polynomial operand


       ::math::polynomials::subPolyn polyn1 polyn2
              Return a new polynomial which is the difference of the two others.

              list polyn1
                     The first polynomial operand

              list polyn2

       ::math::polynomials::multPolyn polyn1 polyn2
              Return a new polynomial which is the product of the two others. If
              one of the arguments is a scalar value, the other polynomial is
              simply scaled.

              list polyn1
                     The first polynomial operand or a scalar

              list polyn2
                     The second polynomial operand or a scalar


       ::math::polynomials::divPolyn polyn1 polyn2
              Divide the first polynomial by the second polynomial and return
              the result. The remainder is dropped

              list polyn1
                     The first polynomial operand

              list polyn2
                     The second polynomial operand


       ::math::polynomials::remainderPolyn polyn1 polyn2
              Divide the first polynomial by the second polynomial and return
              the remainder.

              list polyn
                     The polynomial to be differentiated


       ::math::polynomials::primitivePolyn polyn
              Integrate the polynomial and return the result. The integration
              constant is set to zero.

              list polyn
                     The polynomial to be integrated


       ::math::polynomials::degreePolyn polyn
              Return the degree of the polynomial.

              list polyn

       ::math::polynomials::coeffPolyn polyn index
              Return the coefficient of the term of the index'th degree of the
              polynomial.

              list polyn

       ::math::polynomials::allCoeffsPolyn polyn
              Return the coefficients of the polynomial (in ascending order).

              list polyn
                     The polynomial in question

REMARKS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION
       The implementation for evaluating the polynomials at some point uses
       Horn's rule, which guarantees numerical stability and a minimum of
       arithmetic operations.  To recognise that a polynomial definition is
       indeed a correct definition, it consists of a list of two elements: the
       keyword "POLYNOMIAL" and the list of coefficients in descending order.
       The latter makes it easier to implement Horner's rule.
