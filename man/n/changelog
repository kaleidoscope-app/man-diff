DESCRIPTION
       This package provides Tcl commands for the processing and reformatting of
       text in the "ChangeLog" format generated by emacs.

API
       ::doctools::changelog::scan text
              The command takes the text and parses it under the assumption that
              it contains a ChangeLog as generated by emacs. It returns a data
              structure describing the contents of this ChangeLog.

              This data structure is a list where each element describes one
              entry in the ChangeLog. Each element/entry is then a list of three
              elements describing the date of the entry, its author, and the
              comments made, in this order. The last item in each element/entry,
              the comments, is a list of sections. Each section is described by
              a list containing two elements, a list of file names, and a string
              containing the true comment associated with the files of the
              section.


                  {
                   {
                       date
                       author
                       {
                        {
                            {file ...}
                            commenttext
                        }
                        ...
                       }
                   }
                   {...}
                  }


       ::doctools::changelog::toDoctools title module version entries
              This command converts the pre-parsed ChangeLog entries as
              generated by the command ::doctools::changelog::scan into a
              document in doctools format and returns it as the result of the
              command.

              The other three arguments supply the information for the header of
              that document which is not available from the changelog itself.

       ::doctools::changelog::merge entries...
              Each argument of the command is assumed to be a pre-parsed
              Changelog as generated by the command ::doctools::changelog::scan.
              This command merges all of them into a single structure, and
              collapses multiple entries for the same date and author into a
              single entry. The new structure is returned as the result of the
              command.
