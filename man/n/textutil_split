DESCRIPTION
       The package textutil::split provides commands that split strings by size
       and arbitrary regular expressions.

       The complete set of procedures is described below.

       ::textutil::split::splitn string ?len?
              This command splits the given string into chunks of len characters
              and returns a list containing these chunks. The argument len
              defaults to 1 if none is specified. A negative length is not
              allowed and will cause the command to throw an error. Providing an
              empty string as input is allowed, the command will then return an
              empty list. If the length of the string is not an entire multiple
              of the chunk length, then the last chunk in the generated list
              will be shorter than len.

       ::textutil::split::splitx string ?regexp?
              This command splits the string and return a list. The string is
              split according to the regular expression regexp instead of a
              simple list of chars.  Note that if you parentheses are added into
              the regexp, the parentheses part of separator will be added into
              the result list as additional element. If the string is empty the
              result is the empty list, like for split. If regexp is empty the
              string is split at every character, like split does.  The regular
              expression regexp defaults to "[\\t \\r\\n]+".
