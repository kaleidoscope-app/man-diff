WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       Name:           height
       Class:          Height
       Command-Line Switch:           -height

              Specifies the height of the shell.  The value may be specified in
              any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.  A value of zero
              causes the height to be adjusted to the required value based on
              the size requests of the components placed in the childsite.
              Otherwise, the height is fixed.  The default is zero.  NOTE: This
              may cause some amount of flickering on slower machines.  To
              prevent it simply set the width and height to a appropriate value.

       Name:           master
       Class:          Window
       Command-Line Switch:           -master

              Defines the shell as being a transient window with the master
              window given by the master option.  The master window should be
              either another existing toplevel window or {} for no master.  The
              default is {} for shells and "." for dialogs.

       Name:           modality
       Class:          Modality
       Command-Line Switch:           -modality

              Allows the shell to grab control of the screen in one of three
              different ways: application, system, or none.  Application modal
              prevents any other toplevel windows within the application which
              are direct children of '.' from gaining focus.  System modal locks
              the screen and prevents all windows from gaining focus regardless
              of application.  A modality of none performs no grabs at all.  The
              default is none.

       Name:           padX
       Class:          Pad
       Command-Line Switch:           -padx

              Specifies a padding distance for the childsite in the X-direction
              in any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.  The default is
              10.

       Name:           padY
       Class:          Pad
       Command-Line Switch:           -pady

              Specifies a padding distance for the childsite in the Y-direction
              in any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.  The default is
              10.

       Name:           width
       Class:          Width
       Command-Line Switch:           -width

              Specifies the width of the shell.  The value may be specified in
              any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.  A value of zero
              causes the width to be adjusted to the required value based on the
              size requests of the components placed in the childsite.
              Otherwise, the width is fixed.  The default is zero.  NOTE: This
              may cause some amount of flickering on slower machines.  To
              prevent it simply set the width and height to a appropriate value.

DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::shell command creates a shell which is a top level widget
       which supports modal operation.


METHODS
       The iwidgets::shell command create a new Tcl command whose name is
       pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
       widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following commands are possible for shell widgets:

WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName activate
              Display the shell and wait based on the modality.  For application
              and system modal activations, perform a grab operation, and wait
              for the result.  The result may be returned via an argument to the
              deactivate method.

       pathName center ?widget?
              Centers the shell with respect to another widget.  The widget
              argument is optional.  If provided, it should be the path of
              another widget with to center upon.  If absent, then the shell
              will be centered on the screen as a whole.

       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::shell command.

       pathName childsite
              Returns the pathname of the child site widget.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::shell command.

       pathName deactivate ?arg?
              Deactivate the display of the shell.  The method takes an optional
              argument to be passed to the activate method which returns the
              value.  The optional argument is only effective for application
              and system modal dialogs.
