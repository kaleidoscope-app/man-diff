DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::messagebox command creates a scrolled information messages
       area widget.  Message types can be user defined and configured.  Their
       options include foreground, background, font, bell, and their display
       mode of on or off.  This allows message types to defined as needed,
       removed when no longer so, and modified when necessary.  An export method
       is provided for file I/O.


       The number of lines displayed may be limited with the default being 1000.
       When this limit is reached, the oldest line is removed.  A popup menu
       which appears when the right mouse button has been pressed in the message
       area has been predefined.  The contents of the popup menu by default
       support clearing the area and saving its contents to a file.  Additional
       operations may be defined or existing operations removed by using the
       component command to access the popup menu.


MESSAGE TYPES
       The display characteristics of messages issued to the messagebox vary
       with the message type.  Types are defined by the user and they may be
       added, removed, and configured.  The options of the message type control
       the display include the following:

       -background color
              Color specifies the background color to use for characters
              associated with the message type.  It may have any of the forms
              accepted by Tk_GetColor.

       -bell boolean
              Specifies whether or not to ring the bell whenenver a message of
              this type is issued.  Boolean may have any of the forms accepted
              by Tk_GetBoolean.  The default is 0.

       -font fontName
              FontName is the name of a font to use for drawing characters.  It
              may have any of the forms accepted by Tk_GetFontStruct.

       -foreground color
              Color specifies the foreground color to use for characters
              associated with the message type.  It may have any of the forms
              accepted by Tk_GetColor.

       -show boolean
              Specifies whether of not to display this message type when issued.
              Boolean may have any of the forms accepted by Tk_GetBoolean.  The
              default is 1.


METHODS
       The iwidgets::messagebox command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
       pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
       widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following commands are possible for messagebox widgets:


WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::messagebox command.

       pathName clear
              Clear the messagebox of all messages.

       pathName export filename
              Write text to a file.  If filename exists then contents are
              replaced with text widget contents.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::messagebox command.

       pathName type option msgtype ?arg arg ...?
              This  command  is  used to manipulate message types.  The behavior
              of the command depends on the option argument that follows the
              type keyword.  The following forms of the command are supported:

              pathName type add msgtype ?option value ...?
                     Adds a new message type given by msgtype with the display
                     properties defined by the option value pairs.  See MESSAGE
                     TYPES for information on the options that are supported.

              pathName type cget msgtype option
                     Returns the value of a configuration option for a message
                     type.  Msgtype identifies the message type, and option
                     specifies a particular configuration option, which must be
                     one of the ones listed in the section MESSAGE TYPES.

              pathName type configure msgtype ?option value ...?
                     Query or modify the configuration options for a message
                     type.  If no option is specified, returns a list describing
                     all of the available options for the message type msgtype.
                     If option is specified with no value, then the command
                     returns a list describing the one named option.  If one or
                     more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
                     modifies the given option(s) to have the given value(s);
                     in this case the command returns an empty string.  See
                     MESSAGE TYPES for information on the options that are
                     supported.  pathName type remove msgtype Removes an
                     existing message type given by msgtype.

       pathName issue string ?level? ?tags?
              Print a string to the text area at the given level and with any
              additional tags specified.
