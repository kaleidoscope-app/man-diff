NAME
       tk_popup - Post a popup menu

SYNOPSIS
       tk_popup menu x y ?entry?
________________________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       This procedure posts a menu at a given position on the screen and
       configures Tk so that the menu and its cascaded children can be traversed
       with the mouse or the keyboard.  Menu is the name of a menu widget and x
       and y are the root coordinates at which to display the menu.  If entry is
       omitted or an empty string, the menu's upper left corner is positioned at
       the given point.  Otherwise entry gives the index of an entry in menu and
       the menu will be positioned so that the entry is positioned over the
       given point.

EXAMPLE
       How to attach a simple popup menu to a widget.
              # Create a menu
              set m [menu .popupMenu]
              $m add command -label "Example 1" -command bell
              $m add command -label "Example 2" -command bell

              # Create something to attach it to
              pack [label .l -text "Click me!"]

              # Arrange for the menu to pop up when the label is clicked
