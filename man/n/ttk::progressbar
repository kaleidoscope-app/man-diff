SYNOPSIS
       ttk::progressbar pathName ?options?
________________________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       A ttk::progressbar widget shows the status of a long-running operation.
       They can operate in two modes: determinate mode shows the amount
       completed relative to the total amount of work to be done, and
       indeterminate mode provides an animated display to let the user know that
       something is happening.

STANDARD OPTIONS
       -class                -cursor              -takefocus
       -style

       See the ttk_widget manual entry for details on the standard options.

WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       [-orient orient] One of horizontal or vertical.  Specifies the
       orientation of the progress bar.  [-length length] Specifies the length
       of the long axis of the progress bar (width if horizontal, height if
       vertical).  [-mode mode] One of determinate or indeterminate.
       [-maximum maximum] A floating point number specifying the maximum -value.
       Defaults to 100.  [-value value] The current value of the progress bar.
       In determinate mode, this represents the amount of work completed.  In
       indeterminate mode, it is interpreted modulo -maximum; that is, the
       progress bar completes one “cycle” when the -value increases by -maximum.
       [-variable variable] The name of a Tcl variable which is linked to the
       -value.  If specified, the -value of the progress bar is automatically
       set to the value of the variable whenever the latter is modified.
       [-phase phase] Read-only option.  The widget periodically increments the
       value of this option whenever the -value is greater than 0 and, in
       determinate mode, less than -maximum.  This option may be used by the
       current theme to provide additional animation effects.

WIDGET COMMAND
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the specified option; see
              ttk::widget(n).

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Modify or query widget options; see ttk::widget(n).

       pathName identify x y
              Returns the name of the element at position x, y.  See
              ttk::widget(n).

       pathName instate statespec ?script?
              Test the widget state; see ttk::widget(n).

       pathName start ?interval?
              Begin autoincrement mode: schedules a recurring timer event that
              calls step every interval milliseconds.  If omitted, interval
              defaults to 50 milliseconds (20 steps/second).

       pathName state ?stateSpec?
              Modify or query the widget state; see ttk::widget(n).

       pathName step ?amount?
              Increments the -value by amount.  amount defaults to 1.0 if
              omitted.

       pathName stop
              Stop autoincrement mode: cancels any recurring timer event
              initiated by pathName start.
