NAME
       usual - access default option-handling commands
            for a mega-widget component

SYNOPSIS
       usual ?tag? ?commands?
________________________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       The usual command is used outside of an [incr Tcl] class definition to
       define the usual set of option-handling commands for a component widget.
       Option-handling commands are used when a component is registered with the
       Archetype base class via the "itk_component add" method.  They specify
       how the component's configuration options should be integrated into the
       composite option list for the mega-widget.  Options can be kept, renamed,
       or ignored, as described in the Archetype man page.

       It is tedious to include the same declarations again and again whenever
       components are added.  The usual command allows a standard code fragment
       to be registered for each widget class, which is used by default to
       handle the options.  All of the standard Tk widgets have usual
       declarations defined in the [incr Tk] library.  Similar usual
       declarations should be created whenever a new mega-widget class is
       conceived.  Only the most-generic options should be included in the usual
       declaration.

       The tag name is usually the name of a widget class, which starts with a
       capital letter; however, any string registered here can be used later
       with the usual command described on the Archetype man page.

       If the commands argument is specified, it is associated with the tag
       string, and can be accessed later via itk_component add.

       If only the tag argument is specified, this command looks for an existing
       tag name and returns the commands associated with it.  If there are no
       commands associated with tag, this command returns the null string.

       If no arguments are specified, this command returns a list of all tag
       names previously registered.


EXAMPLE
       Following is the usual declaration for the standard Tk button widget:
              itk::usual Button {
                  keep -background -cursor -foreground -font
                  keep -activebackground -activeforeground -disabledforeground
                  keep -highlightcolor -highlightthickness
                  rename -highlightbackground -background background Background
              }
       Only the options that would be common to all buttons in a single mega-
       widget are kept or renamed.  Options like "-text" that would be unique to
       a particular button are ignored.
