NAME
       ttk::treeview - hierarchical multicolumn data display widget

SYNOPSIS
       ttk::treeview pathname ?options?
________________________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       The ttk::treeview widget displays a hierarchical collection of items.
       Each item has a textual label, an optional image, and an optional list of
       data values.  The data values are displayed in successive columns after
       the tree label.

       The order in which data values are displayed may be controlled by setting
       the -displaycolumns widget option.  The tree widget can also display
       column headings.  Columns may be accessed by number or by symbolic names
       listed in the -columns widget option; see COLUMN IDENTIFIERS.

       Each item is identified by a unique name.  The widget will generate item
       IDs if they are not supplied by the caller.  There is a distinguished
       root item, named {}.  The root item itself is not displayed; its children
       appear at the top level of the hierarchy.

       Each item also has a list of tags, which can be used to associate event
       bindings with individual items and control the appearance of the item.

       Treeview widgets support horizontal and vertical scrolling with the
       standard -[xy]scrollcommand options and [xy]view widget commands.

STANDARD OPTIONS
       -class                -cursor              -takefocus
       -style                -xscrollcommand      -yscrollcommand

       See the ttk_widget manual entry for details on the standard options.

WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       [-columns columns] A list of column identifiers, specifying the number of
       columns and their names.  [-displaycolumns displayColumns] A list of
       column identifiers (either symbolic names or integer indices) specifying
       which data columns are displayed and the order in which they appear, or
       the string #all.  If set to #all (the default), all columns are shown in
       the order given.  [-height height] Specifies the number of rows which
       should be visible.  Note: the requested width is determined from the sum
       of the column widths.  [-padding padding] Specifies the internal padding
       for the widget.  The padding is a list of up to four length
       specifications; see Ttk_GetPaddingFromObj() for details.
       [-selectmode selectMode] Controls how the built-in class bindings manage
       the selection.  One of extended, browse, or none.

              If set to extended (the default), multiple items may be selected.
              If browse, only a single item will be selected at a time.  If
              none, the selection will not be changed.

              Note that application code and tag bindings can set the selection
              however they wish, regardless of the value of -selectmode.
       [-show show] A list containing zero or more of the following values,
       specifying which elements of the tree to display.

              tree   Display tree labels in column #0.

              headings
                     Display the heading row.

              The default is tree headings, i.e., show all elements.

              NOTE: Column #0 always refers to the tree column, even if -show
              tree is not specified.

WIDGET COMMAND
       pathname bbox item ?column?
              Returns the bounding box (relative to the treeview widget's
              window) of the specified item in the form x y width height.  If
              column is specified, returns the bounding box of that cell.  If
              the item is not visible (i.e., if it is a descendant of a closed
              item or is scrolled offscreen), returns the empty list.

       pathname cget option
              Returns the current value of the specified option; see
              ttk::widget(n).

       pathname children item ?newchildren?
              If newchildren is not specified, returns the list of children
              belonging to item.

              If newchildren is specified, replaces item's child list with
              newchildren.  Items in the old child list not present in the new
              child list are detached from the tree.  None of the items in
              newchildren may be an ancestor of item.

       pathname column column ?-option ?value -option value...?
              Query or modify the options for the specified column.  If no
              -option is specified, returns a dictionary of option/value pairs.
              If a single -option is specified, returns the value of that
              option.  Otherwise, the options are updated with the specified
              values.  The following options may be set on each column:

              -id name
                     The column name.  This is a read-only option.  For example,
                     [$pathname column #n -id] returns the data column
                     associated with display column #n.

              -anchor
                     Specifies how the text in this column should be aligned
                     with respect to the cell. One of n, ne, e, se, s, sw, w,
                     nw, or center.

              -minwidth
                     The minimum width of the column in pixels.  The treeview
                     widget will not make the column any smaller than -minwidth
                     when the widget is resized or the user drags a column
                     separator.

              -stretch
                     Specifies whether or not the column's width should be
                     adjusted when the widget is resized.

              -width w
                     The width of the column in pixels.  Default is something
                     reasonable, probably 200 or so.

              Use pathname column #0 to configure the tree column.

       pathname configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Modify or query widget options; see ttk::widget(n).

       pathname delete itemList
              Deletes each of the items in itemList and all of their
              descendants.  The root item may not be deleted.  See also: detach.

       pathname detach itemList
              Unlinks all of the specified items in itemList from the tree.  The
              items and all of their descendants are still present and may be
              reinserted at another point in the tree with the move operation,
              but will not be displayed until that is done.  The root item may
              not be detached.  See also: delete.

       pathname exists item
              Returns 1 if the specified item is present in the tree, 0
              otherwise.

       pathname focus ?item?
              If item is specified, sets the focus item to item.  Otherwise,
              returns the current focus item, or {} if there is none.

       pathname heading column ?-option ?value -option value...?
              Query or modify the heading options for the specified column.
              Valid options are:

              -text text
                     The text to display in the column heading.

              -image imageName
                     Specifies an image to display to the right of the column
                     heading.

              -anchor anchor
                     Specifies how the heading text should be aligned.  One of
                     the standard Tk anchor values.

              -command script
                     A script to evaluate when the heading label is pressed.

              Use pathname heading #0 to configure the tree column heading.

       pathname identify component x y
              Returns a description of the specified component under the point
              given by x and y, or the empty string if no such component is
              present at that position.  The following subcommands are
              supported:

              pathname identify region x y
                     Returns one of:

                     heading
                            Tree heading area; use [pathname identify column x
                            y] to determine the heading number.

                     separator
                            Space between two column headings; [pathname
                            identify column x y] will return the display column
                            identifier of the heading to left of the separator.

                     tree   The tree area.

                     cell   A data cell.
              pathname identify item x y Returns the item ID of the item at
              position y.

              pathname identify column x y
                     Returns the data column identifier of the cell at position
                     x.  The tree column has ID #0.

              pathname identify element x y
                     The element at position x,y.

              pathname identify row x y
                     Obsolescent synonym for pathname identify item.

              See COLUMN IDENTIFIERS for a discussion of display columns and
              data columns.

       pathname index item
              Returns the integer index of item within its parent's list of
              children.

       pathname insert parent index ?-id id? options...
              Creates a new item.  parent is the item ID of the parent item, or
              the empty string {} to create a new top-level item.  index is an
              integer, or the value end, specifying where in the list of
              parent's children to insert the new item.  If index is less than
              or equal to zero, the new node is inserted at the beginning; if
              index is greater than or equal to the current number of children,
              it is inserted at the end.  If -id is specified, it is used as the
              item identifier; id must not already exist in the tree.
              Otherwise, a new unique identifier is generated.

              pathname insert returns the item identifier of the newly created
              item.  See ITEM OPTIONS for the list of available options.

       pathname instate statespec ?script?
              Test the widget state; see ttk::widget(n).

       pathname item item ?-option ?value -option value...?
              Query or modify the options for the specified item.  If no -option
              is specified, returns a dictionary of option/value pairs.  If a
              single -option is specified, returns the value of that option.
              Otherwise, the item's options are updated with the specified
              values.  See ITEM OPTIONS for the list of available options.

       pathname move item parent index
              Moves item to position index in parent's list of children.  It is
              illegal to move an item under one of its descendants.

              If index is less than or equal to zero, item is moved to the
              beginning; if greater than or equal to the number of children, it
              is moved to the end.

       pathname next item
              Returns the identifier of item's next sibling, or {} if item is
              the last child of its parent.

       pathname parent item
              Returns the ID of the parent of item, or {} if item is at the top
              level of the hierarchy.

       pathname prev item
              Returns the identifier of item's previous sibling, or {} if item
              is the first child of its parent.

       pathname see item
              Ensure that item is visible: sets all of item's ancestors to -open
              true, and scrolls the widget if necessary so that item is within
              the visible portion of the tree.

       pathname selection ?selop itemList?
              If selop is not specified, returns the list of selected items.
              Otherwise, selop is one of the following:

              pathname selection set itemList
                     itemList becomes the new selection.

              pathname selection add itemList
                     Add itemList to the selection

              pathname selection remove itemList
                     Remove itemList from the selection

              pathname selection toggle itemList
                     Toggle the selection state of each item in itemList.

       pathname set item ?column? ?value?
              With one argument, returns a dictionary of column/value pairs for
              the specified item.  With two arguments, returns the current value
              of the specified column.  With three arguments, sets the value of
              column column in item item to the specified value.  See also
              COLUMN IDENTIFIERS.

       pathname state ?stateSpec?
              Modify or query the widget state; see ttk::widget(n).

       pathName tag args...

              pathName tag bind tagName ?sequence? ?script?
                     Add a Tk binding script for the event sequence sequence to
                     the tag tagName.  When an X event is delivered to an item,
                     binding scripts for each of the item's -tags are evaluated
                     in order as per bindtags(n).

                     <KeyPress>, <KeyRelease>, and virtual events are sent to
                     the focus item.  <ButtonPress>, <ButtonRelease>, and
                     <Motion> events are sent to the item under the mouse
                     pointer.  No other event types are supported.

                     The binding script undergoes %-substitutions before
                     evaluation; see bind(n) for details.

              pathName tag configure tagName ?option? ?value option value...?
                     Query or modify the options for the specified tagName.  If
                     one or more option/value pairs are specified, sets the
                     value of those options for the specified tag.  If a single
                     option is specified, returns the value of that option (or
                     the empty string if the option has not been specified for
                     tagName).  With no additional arguments, returns a
                     dictionary of the option settings for tagName.  See TAG
                     OPTIONS for the list of available options.

              pathName tag has tagName ?item?
                     If item is specified, returns 1 or 0 depending on whether
                     the specified item has the named tag.  Otherwise, returns a
                     list of all items which have the specified tag.

              pathName tag names
                     Returns a list of all tags used by the widget.

              pathName tag add tag items
                     Adds the specified tag to each of the listed items.  If tag
                     is already present for a particular item, then the -tags
                     for that item are unchanged.

              pathName tag remove tag ?items?
                     Removes the specified tag from each of the listed items.
                     If items is omitted, removes tag from each item in the
                     tree.  If tag is not present for a particular item, then
                     the -tags for that item are unchanged.

       pathName xview args
              Standard command for horizontal scrolling; see widget(n).

       pathName yview args
              Standard command for vertical scrolling; see ttk::widget(n).

ITEM OPTIONS
       The following item options may be specified for items in the insert and
       item widget commands.  [-text text] The textual label to display for the
       item.  [-image image] A Tk image, displayed to the left of the label.
       [-values values] The list of values associated with the item.

              Each item should have the same number of values as the -columns
              widget option.  If there are fewer values than columns, the
              remaining values are assumed empty.  If there are more values than
              columns, the extra values are ignored.
       [-open open] A boolean value indicating whether the item's children
       should be displayed (-open true) or hidden (-open false).  [-tags tags] A
       list of tags associated with this item.

TAG OPTIONS
       The following options may be specified on tags:

       -foreground
              Specifies the text foreground color.

       -background
              Specifies the cell or item background color.

       -font  Specifies the font to use when drawing text.

       -image Specifies the item image, in case the item's -image option is
              empty.

COLUMN IDENTIFIERS
       Column identifiers take any of the following forms:

       •      A symbolic name from the list of -columns.

       •      An integer n, specifying the nth data column.

       •      A string of the form #n, where n is an integer, specifying the nth
              display column.

       NOTE: Item -values may be displayed in a different order than the order
       in which they are stored.

       NOTE: Column #0 always refers to the tree column, even if -show tree is
       not specified.

       A data column number is an index into an item's -values list; a display
       column number is the column number in the tree where the values are
       displayed.  Tree labels are displayed in column #0.  If -displaycolumns
       is not set, then data column n is displayed in display column #n+1.
       Again, column #0 always refers to the tree column.

VIRTUAL EVENTS
       The treeview widget generates the following virtual events.

       <<TreeviewSelect>>
              Generated whenever the selection changes.

       <<TreeviewOpen>>
              Generated just before setting the focus item to -open true.

       <<TreeviewClose>>
              Generated just after setting the focus item to -open false.

       The focus and selection widget commands can be used to determine the
       affected item or items.
