NAME
       trf-intro - Introduction to Trf

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tcl  ?8.2?

       package require Trf  ?2.1.4?

________________________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       The package Trf provides a number of commands which take data and
       transform them in various ways.

BACKGROUND
       The implementation of Trf began as proof-of-concept of the validity and
       usefulness of the "stacked channel" patches to the core. These patches
       allow the writing of extensions to the generic I/O system of the core
       which are able to intercept all read/write operations on designated
       channels, thus giving it the ability to transform the data flowing
       through these channels as desired.

       This allows things like transparent encryption, compression, charset
       recoding, etc.

       Since version 8.2 of the tcl core the aforementioned patches are part of
       the tcl core itself, changing the status of trf from "extension requiring
       core patches" to "normal extension".

       Other packages built upon either the stackd channels directly, or Trf
       are:

       [1]    TrfCrypt, by myself, contains various encryption systems

       [2]    TLS, an SSL/TLS implementation by Matt Newman.

       [3]    Tcl MIME by Marshall Rose.

API
       The commands provide by trf can be placed into the three categories
       listed below. Note that all commands are added to the global namespace.

       Encodings
              The encoding commands either take some data and return the same
              data in encoded form, or take encoded data and return a decoded
              result.

              [1]    oct

              [2]    hex

              [3]    oct

              [4]    base64

              [5]    uuencode

              [6]    ascii85

              [7]    otp_words

              [8]    quoted-printable


       Message Digests
              The second category are message digests in general, simple ones
              like crc, and cryptographically strong algorithms like md5.

              [1]    crc-zlib

              [2]    crc

              [3]    adler

              [4]    md2

              [5]    md5

              [6]    md5_otp

              [7]    sha

              [8]    sha1

              [9]    sha1_otp

              [10]   haval

              [11]   ripemd-160

              [12]   ripemd-128


       Miscellaneous
              At last a number of commands not readily placed into categories
              providing password crypting, general transformations, data
              compression, error correction and others.

              [1]    crypt

              [2]    md5crypt

              [3]    transform

              [4]    rs_ecc

              [5]    zip

              [6]    bz2

              [7]    unstack
