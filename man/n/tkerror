SYNOPSIS
       tkerror message

DESCRIPTION
       Note: as of Tk 4.1 the tkerror command has been renamed to bgerror
       because the event loop (which is what usually invokes it) is now part of
       Tcl.  For backward compatibility the bgerror provided by the current Tk
       version still tries to call tkerror if there is one (or an auto loadable
       one), so old script defining that error handler should still work, but
       you should anyhow modify your scripts to use bgerror instead of tkerror
       because that support for the old name might vanish in the near future. If
       that call fails, bgerror posts a dialog showing the error and offering to
       see the stack trace to the user. If you want your own error management
       you should directly override bgerror instead of tkerror.  Documentation
       for bgerror is available as part of Tcl's documentation.
