DESCRIPTION
       The tkwait command waits for one of several things to happen, then it
       returns without taking any other actions.  The return value is always an
       empty string.  If the first argument is variable (or any abbreviation of
       it) then the second argument is the name of a global variable and the
       command waits for that variable to be modified.  If the first argument is
       visibility (or any abbreviation of it) then the second argument is the
       name of a window and the tkwait command waits for a change in its
       visibility state (as indicated by the arrival of a VisibilityNotify
       event).  This form is typically used to wait for a newly-created window
       to appear on the screen before taking some action.  If the first argument
       is window (or any abbreviation of it) then the second argument is the
       name of a window and the tkwait command waits for that window to be
       destroyed.  This form is typically used to wait for a user to finish
       interacting with a dialog box before using the result of that
       interaction.

       While the tkwait command is waiting it processes events in the normal
       fashion, so the application will continue to respond to user
       interactions.  If an event handler invokes tkwait again, the nested call
       to tkwait must complete before the outer call can complete.
