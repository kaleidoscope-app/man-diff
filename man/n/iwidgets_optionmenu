WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       Name:           clickTime
       Class:          ClickTime
       Command-Line Switch:           -clicktime

              Interval time, in msec, used to determine that a single mouse
              click has occurred. Used to post menu on a "quick" mouse click.
              Note: changing this value may cause the sigle-click functionality
              to not work properly.  The default is 150 msec.

       Name:           command
       Class:          Command
       Command-Line Switch:           -command

              Specifies a Tcl command procedure to be evaluated following a
              change in the current option menu selection.

       Name:           cyclicOn
       Class:          CyclicOn
       Command-Line Switch:           -cyclicon

              Turns on/off the 3rd mouse button capability. The value may be
              specified in any of the forms acceptable to Tcl_GetBoolean.  This
              feature allows the right mouse button to cycle through the popup
              menu list without poping it up. The right mouse button cycles
              through the menu in reverse order.  The default is true.

       Name:           popupCursor
       Class:          Cursor
       Command-Line Switch:           -popupcursor

              Specifies  the mouse cursor to be used for the popup menu.  The
              value may have any of the  forms  acceptable to Tk_GetCursor.

       Name:           state
       Class:          State
       Command-Line Switch:           -state

              Specified one of two states for the optionmenu: normal, or
              disabled.  If the optionmenu is disabled, then option menu
              selection is ignored.

       Name:           width
       Class:          Width
       Command-Line Switch:           -width

              Specifies a fixed size for the menu button label in any of the
              forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.  If the text is too small to fit
              in the label, the text is clipped.  Note: Normally, when a new
              list is created, or new items are added to an existing list, the
              menu button label is resized automatically.  Setting this option
              overrides that functionality.

DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::optionmenu command creates an option menu widget with
       options to manage it.  An option menu displays a frame containing a label
       and a button.  A pop-up menu will allow for the value of the button to
       change.


METHODS
       The iwidgets::optionmenu command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
       pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
       widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.

       Many of the widget commands for an optionmenu take as one argument an
       indicator of which entry of the option menu to operate on.  These
       indicators are called indexes and may be specified in any of the
       following forms:

       number      Specifies the entry numerically, where 0 corresponds to the
                   top-most entry of the option menu, 1 to the entry below it,
                   and so on.

       end         Indicates the bottommost entry in the menu.  If there are no
                   entries in the menu then -1 is returned.

       select      Returns the numerical index of the currently selected option
                   menu entry.  If no entries exist in the menu, then -1 is
                   returned.

       pattern     If the index doesn't satisfy one of the above forms then this
                   form is used.  Pattern is pattern-matched against the label
                   of each entry in the option menu, in order from the top down,
                   until a matching entry is found.  The rules of
                   Tcl_StringMatch are used.

       The following widget commands are possible for optionmenu widgets:


WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::optionmenu command.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::optionmenu command.

       pathName delete first ?last?
              Delete all of the option menu entries between first and last
              inclusive.  If last is omitted then it defaults to first.

       pathName disable index
              Disable the option menu entry specified by index.  Disabling a
              menu item will prevent the user from being able to select this
              item from the menu.  This only effects the state of the item in
              the menu, in other words, should the item be the currently
              selected item, the programmer is responsible for determining this
              condition and taking appropriate action.

       pathName enable index
              Enable the option menu entry specified by index.  Enabling a menu
              item allows the user to select this item from the menu.

       pathName get ?first? ?last?
              If no arguments are specified, this operation returns the
              currently selected option menu item.  Otherwise, it returns the
              name of the option at index first, or a range of options between
              first and last.

       pathName index index
              Returns the numerical index corresponding to index.

       pathName insert index string ?string?
              Insert an item, or list of items, into the menu at location index.

       pathName select index
              Select an item from the option menu to be displayed as the
              currently selected item.

       pathName sort mode
              Sort the current menu in either ascending, or descending order.
              The values increasing, or decreasing are also accepted.
