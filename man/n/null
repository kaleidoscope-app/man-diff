NAME
       null - Create and manipulate null channels

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tcl

       package require memchan

       null

________________________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       The command described here is only available in a not-yet released
       version of the package. Use the CVS to get the sources.

       null   creates a null channel which absorbs everything written into it.
              Reading from it is not possible, or rather will always return zero
              bytes. These channels are essentially Tcl-specific variants of the
              null device for unixoid operating systems (/dev/null). Transfering
              the generated channel between interpreters is possible but does
              not make much sense.

OPTIONS
       Memory channels created by null provide one additional option to set or
       query.

       -delay ?milliseconds?
              A null channel is always writable and readable. This means that
              all fileevent-handlers will fire continuously.  To avoid
              starvation of other event sources the events raised by this
              channel type have a configurable delay. This option is set in
              milliseconds and defaults to 5.

       A null channel is always writable and never readable. This means that a
       writable fileevent-handler will fire continuously and a readable
       fileevent-handler never at all. The exception to the latter is only the
       destruction of the channel which will cause the delivery of an eof event
       to a readable handler.
