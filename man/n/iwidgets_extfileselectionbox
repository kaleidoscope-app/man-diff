DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::extfileselectionbox command creates an extended file
       selection box which is slightly different than the fileselectionbox
       widget.  The differences are mostly cosmetic in that the listboxes are
       within a panedwindow and the entryfields for the filter and selection
       have been replaced by comboboxes.  Other than that the interface is
       practically the same.


METHODS
       The iwidgets::extfileselectionbox command creates a new Tcl command whose
       name is pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations
       on the widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following commands are possible for extfileselectionbox widgets:


WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::extfileselectionbox command.

       pathName childsite
              Returns the child site widget path name.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::extfileselectionbox
              command.

       pathName filter
              Update the current contents of the extended file selection box
              based on the current filter combobox value.

       pathName get
              Returns the current value of the selection combobox widget.
