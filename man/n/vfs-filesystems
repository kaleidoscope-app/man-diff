DESCRIPTION
       The package vfs provides not only the means to implement a virtual
       filesystem at the tcl level, but also a number of ready to be used
       filesystems as well.

       Each of these filesystem exists as its own package, and can be accessed
       through package require vfs::NAME.  The whole set of these virtual
       filesystems is known informally as Â´vfslib'.

SUPPORTED VFS TYPES
       Currently supported are ftp, tar, http, zip, mk4, ns, and webdav.  In
       addition there is the ability to mount any 'urltype' as a new directory,
       provided an appropriate vfs is supported.  This means that you can treat
       urls based on the schemes ftp://, http:// and file:// as files.  To do
       this, simply evaluate the command vfs::urltype::Mount ftp for example.
       Any access inside the new volume will result in an attempt to require a
       package through package require vfs::${type}, which must therefore exist,
       or errors will be thrown.  If a filesystem is loaded, use the associated
       command listed below to mount a source for that filesystem as a tcl
       directory.

       vfs::zip::Mount path to
              Mount the zip file path as directory to.

       vfs::mk4::Mount path to
              Mount the metakit database file file path as directory to.

       vfs::tar::Mount path to
              Mount the tar file path as directory to.

       vfs::ftp::Mount path to
              Mount the ftp url path as directory to.

       vfs::ns::Mount path to
              Mount the tcl namespace path as directory to.

       vfs::webdav::Mount path to
              Mount the webdav url path as directory to.

       vfs::http::Mount path to
              Mount the http url path as directory to.

       vfs::urltype::Mount path to
              Mount the url path, of type urltype as directory to.

LIMITATIONS
       Most of the vfs types listed above have not been very well debugged as
       yet.  Please test them!
