DESCRIPTION
       A ttk::button widget displays a textual label and/or image, and evaluates
       a command when pressed.

STANDARD OPTIONS
       -class                -compound            -cursor
       -image                -state               -style
       -takefocus            -text                -textvariable
       -underline            -width

       See the ttk_widget manual entry for details on the standard options.

WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       [-command command] A script to evaluate when the widget is invoked.
       [-default default] May be set to one of  normal, active, or disabled.  In
       a dialog box, one button may be designated the “default” button (meaning,
       roughly, “the one that gets invoked when the user presses <Enter>”).
       active indicates that this is currently the default button; normal means
       that it may become the default button, and disabled means that it is not
       defaultable.  The default is normal.

              Depending on the theme, the default button may be displayed with
              an extra highlight ring, or with a different border color.
       [-width width] If greater than zero, specifies how much space, in
       character widths, to allocate for the text label.  If less than zero,
       specifies a minimum width.  If zero or unspecified, the natural width of
       the text label is used.  Note that some themes may specify a non-zero
       -width in the style.

WIDGET COMMAND
       In addition to the standard cget, configure, identify, instate, and state
       commands, buttons support the following additional widget commands:

       pathName invoke
              Invokes the command associated with the button.

STANDARD STYLES
       Ttk::button widgets support the Toolbutton style in all standard themes,
       which is useful for creating widgets for toolbars.

COMPATIBILITY OPTIONS
       [-state state] May be set to normal or disabled to control the disabled
       state bit. This is a “write-only” option: setting it changes the widget
       state, but the state widget command does not affect the state option.
