DESCRIPTION
       A ttk::checkbutton widget is used to show or change a setting.  It has
       two states, selected and deselected.  The state of the checkbutton may be
       linked to a Tcl variable.

WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       [-command command] A Tcl script to execute whenever the widget is
       invoked.  [-offvalue offValue] The value to store in the associated
       -variable when the widget is deselected.  Defaults to 0.
       [-onvalue onValue] The value to store in the associated -variable when
       the widget is selected.  Defaults to 1.  [-variable variable] The name of
       a global variable whose value is linked to the widget.  Defaults to the
       widget pathname if not specified.

WIDGET COMMAND
       In addition to the standard cget, configure, identify, instate, and state
       commands, checkbuttons support the following additional widget commands:

       pathname invoke
              Toggles between the selected and deselected states and evaluates
              the associated -command.  If the widget is currently selected,
              sets the -variable to the -offvalue and deselects the widget;
              otherwise, sets the -variable to the -onvalue Returns the result
              of the -command.

WIDGET STATES
       The widget does not respond to user input if the disabled state is set.
       The widget sets the selected state whenever the linked -variable is set
       to the widget's -onvalue, and clears it otherwise.  The widget sets the
       alternate state whenever the linked -variable is unset.  (The alternate
       state may be used to indicate a “tri-state” or “indeterminate”
       selection.)

STANDARD STYLES
       Ttk::checkbutton widgets support the Toolbutton style in all standard
       themes, which is useful for creating widgets for toolbars.
