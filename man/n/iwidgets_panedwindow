       Class:          Height
       Command-Line Switch:           -height

              Specifies the overall height of the paned window in any of the
              forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.  The default is 10 pixels.

       Name:           orient
       Class:          Orient
       Command-Line Switch:           -orient

              Specifies the orientation of the separators: vertical or
              horizontal.  The default is horizontal.

       Name:           sashBorderWidth
       Class:          BorderWidth
       Command-Line Switch:           -sashborderwidth

              Specifies a value indicating the width of the 3-D border to draw
              around the outside of the sash in any of the forms acceptable to
              Tk_GetPixels.  The default is 2 pixels.

              default is crosshair.

       Name:           sashHeight
       Class:          Height
       Command-Line Switch:           -sashheight

DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::panedwindow command creates a multiple paned window widget
       capable of orienting the panes either vertically or horizontally.  Each
       pane is itself a frame acting as a child site for other widgets.  The
       border separating each pane contains a sash which allows user positioning
       of the panes relative to one another.


METHODS
       The iwidgets::panedwindow command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
       pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
       widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.

       Many of the widget commands for the panedwindow take as one argument an
       indicator of which pane of the paned window to operate on.  These
       indicators are called indexes and allow reference and manipulation of
       panes regardless of their current map state.  Paned window indexes may be
       specified in any of the following forms:

       number      Specifies the pane numerically, where 0 corresponds to the
                   nearest (top/left-most) pane of the paned window.

       end         Indicates the farthest (bottom/right-most) pane of the paned
                   window.

       pattern     If the index doesn't satisfy one of the above forms then this
                   form is used.  Pattern is pattern-matched against the tag of
                   each pane in the panedwindow, in order from left/top to
                   right/left, until a matching entry is found.  The rules of
                   Tcl_StringMatch are used.


WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName add tag ?option value option value?
              Adds a new pane to the paned window on the far side
              (right/bottom).  The following options may be specified:

              -margin value
                     Specifies the border distance between the pane and pane
                     contents is any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.
                     The default is 8 pixels.

              -minimum value
                     Specifies the minimum size that a pane's contents may reach
                     not inclusive of twice the margin in any of the forms
                     acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.  The default is 10 pixels.

                     The add method returns the path name of the pane.

       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::panedwindow command.

       pathName childsite ?index?
              Returns a list of the child site path names or a specific child
              site given an index.  The list is constructed from the near side
              (left/top) to the far side (right/bottom).

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::panedwindow command.

       pathName delete index
              Deletes a specified pane given an index.

       pathName fraction percentage percentage ?percentage percentage ...?
              Sets the visible percentage of the panes.  Specifies a set of
              percentages which are applied to the visible panes from the near
              side (left/top).  The number of percentages must be equal to the
              current number of visible (mapped) panes and add up to 100.

       pathName hide index
              Changes the visiblity of the specified pane, allowing a previously
              displayed pane to be visually removed rather than deleted.

       pathName index index
              Returns the numerical index corresponding to index.

       pathName insert index tag ?option value option value ...?
              Same as the add command except that it inserts the new pane just
              before the one given by index, instead of appending to the end of
              the panedwindow.  The option, and value arguments have the same
              interpretation as for the add widget command.

       pathName paneconfigure index ?options?
              This command is similar to the configure command, except that it
              applies to the options for an individual pane, whereas configure
              applies to the options for the paned window as a whole.  Options
              may have any of the values accepted by the add widget command.  If
              options are specified, options are modified as indicated in the
              command and the command returns an empty string.  If no options
              are specified, returns a list describing the current options for
              entry index (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on the format of
              this list).

       pathName reset
              Redisplays the pane window using default percentages.

       pathName show index
              Changes the visiblity of the specified pane, allowing a previously
              hidden pane to be displayed.


NOTES
              Dynamic changing of the margin and or minimum options to values
              which make the current configuration invalid will block subsequent
              sash movement until the fractions are modified via the fraction
              method.  For example a panedwindow is created with three panes and
              the minimum and margin options are at their default settings.
              Next the user moves the sashes to compact the panes to one side.
              Now, if the minimum is increased on the most compressed pane via
              the paneconfigure method to a large enough value, then sash
              movement is blocked until the fractions are adjusted.  This
              situation is unusual and under normal operation of the
              panedwindow, this problem will never occur.

EXAMPLE

               package require Iwidgets 4.0
               iwidgets::panedwindow .pw -width 300 -height 300
               .pw add top
               .pw add middle -margin 10
               .pw add bottom -margin 10 -minimum 10

               pack .pw -fill both -expand yes

               foreach pane [.pw childSite] {
                  button $pane.b -text $pane -relief raised -borderwidth 2
                  pack $pane.b -fill both -expand yes
               }

               .pw fraction 50 30 20
               .pw paneconfigure 0 -minimum 20
               .pw paneconfigure bottom -margin 15
