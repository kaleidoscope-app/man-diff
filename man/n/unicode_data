DESCRIPTION
       The unicode::data package is a helper for unicode, providing it with the
       data tables needed to perform its functions. It is an internal package
       which should not be accessed on its own. Because of that it has no
       publicly documented API either. Its implementation is generated by a
       script.

       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain

       ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or
       documentation.
