DESCRIPTION
       ttk::radiobutton widgets are used in groups to show or change a set of
       mutually-exclusive options.  Radiobuttons are linked to a Tcl variable,
       and have an associated value; when a radiobutton is clicked, it sets the
       variable to its associated value.

STANDARD OPTIONS
       -class                -compound            -cursor
       -image                -state               -style
       -takefocus            -text                -textvariable
       -underline            -width

       See the ttk_widget manual entry for details on the standard options.

WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       [-command command] A Tcl script to evaluate whenever the widget is
       invoked.  [-value Value] The value to store in the associated -variable
       when the widget is selected.  [-variable variable] The name of a global
       variable whose value is linked to the widget.  Default value is
       ::selectedButton.

WIDGET COMMAND
       In addition to the standard cget, configure, identify, instate, and state
       commands, radiobuttons support the following additional widget commands:

       pathname invoke
              Sets the -variable to the -value, selects the widget, and
              evaluates the associated -command.  Returns the result of the
              -command, or the empty string if no -command is specified.

WIDGET STATES
       The widget does not respond to user input if the disabled state is set.
       The widget sets the selected state whenever the linked -variable is set
       to the widget's -value, and clears it otherwise.  The widget sets the
       alternate state whenever the linked -variable is unset.  (The alternate
       state may be used to indicate a “tri-state” or “indeterminate”
       selection.)

STANDARD STYLES
       Ttk::radiobutton widgets support the Toolbutton style in all standard
       themes, which is useful for creating widgets for toolbars.
