NAME
       unset - Delete variables

SYNOPSIS
       unset ?-nocomplain? ?--? ?name name name ...?
________________________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       This command removes one or more variables.  Each name is a variable
       name, specified in any of the ways acceptable to the set command.  If a
       name refers to an element of an array then that element is removed
       without affecting the rest of the array.  If a name consists of an array
       name with no parenthesized index, then the entire array is deleted.  The
       unset command returns an empty string as result.  If -nocomplain is
       specified as the first argument, any possible errors are suppressed.  The
       option may not be abbreviated, in order to disambiguate it from possible
       variable names.  The option -- indicates the end of the options, and
       should be used if you wish to remove a variable with the same name as any
       of the options.  If an error occurs, any variables after the named one
       causing the error are not deleted.  An error can occur when the named
       variable does not exist, or the name refers to an array element but the
       variable is a scalar, or the name refers to a variable in a non-existent
       namespace.

EXAMPLE
       Create an array containing a mapping from some numbers to their squares
       and remove the array elements for non-prime numbers:
              array set squares {
                  1 1    6 36
                  2 4    7 49
                  3 9    8 64
                  4 16   9 81
                  5 25  10 100
              }

              puts "The squares are:"
              parray squares

              unset squares(1) squares(4) squares(6)
              unset squares(8) squares(9) squares(10)

              puts "The prime squares are:"
              parray squares
