       -orient               -relief

       See the options manual entry for details on the standard options.

WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       [-handlepad handlePad] When sash handles are drawn, specifies the
       distance from the top or left end of the sash (depending on the
       orientation of the widget) at which to draw the handle.  May be any value
       accepted by Tk_GetPixels.  [-handlesize handleSize] Specifies the side
       length of a sash handle.  Handles are always drawn as squares.  May be
       any value accepted by Tk_GetPixels.  [-height height] Specifies a desired
       height for the overall panedwindow widget. May be any value accepted by
       Tk_GetPixels. If an empty string, the widget will be made high enough to
       allow all contained widgets to have their natural height.
       [-opaqueresize opaqueResize] Specifies whether panes should be resized as
       a sash is moved (true), or if resizing should be deferred until the sash
       is placed (false).  [-sashcursor sashCursor] Mouse cursor to use when
       over a sash.  If null, sb_h_double_arrow will be used for horizontal
       panedwindows, and sb_v_double_arrow will be used for vertical
       panedwindows.  [-sashpad sashPad] Specifies the amount of padding to
       leave of each side of a sash.  May be any value accepted by Tk_GetPixels.
       [-sashrelief sashRelief] Relief to use when drawing a sash.  May be any
       of the standard Tk relief values.  [-sashwidth sashWidth] Specifies the
       width of each sash.  May be any value accepted by Tk_GetPixels.
       [-showhandle showHandle] Specifies whether sash handles should be shown.
       May be any valid Tcl boolean value.  [-width width] Specifies a desired
       width for the overall panedwindow widget. May be any value accepted by
       Tk_GetPixels. If an empty string, the widget will be made wide enough to

DESCRIPTION
       The panedwindow command creates a new window (given by the pathName
       argument) and makes it into a panedwindow widget.  Additional options,
       described above, may be specified on the command line or in the option
       database to configure aspects of the panedwindow such as its default
       background color and relief.  The panedwindow command returns the path
       name of the new window.

       A panedwindow widget contains any number of panes, arranged horizontally
       or vertically, according to the value of the -orient option.  Each pane
       contains one widget, and each pair of panes is separated by a moveable
       (via mouse movements) sash.  Moving a sash causes the widgets on either
       side of the sash to be resized.

WIDGET COMMAND
       The panedwindow command creates a new Tcl command whose name is the same
       as the path name of the panedwindow's window.  This command may be used
       to invoke various operations on the widget.  It has the following general
       form:
              pathName option ?arg arg ...?
       PathName is the name of the command, which is the same as the panedwindow
       widget's path name.  Option and the args determine the exact behavior of
       the command.  The following commands are possible for panedwindow
       widgets:

       pathName add window ?window ...? ?option value ...?
              Add one or more windows to the panedwindow, each in a separate
              pane.  The arguments consist of the names of one or more windows
              followed by pairs of arguments that specify how to manage the
              windows.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              configure subcommand.

       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              panedwindow command.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string. Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the panedwindow command.

       pathName forget window ?window ...?
              Remove the pane containing window from the panedwindow.  All
              geometry management options for window will be forgotten.

       pathName identify x y
              Identify the panedwindow component underneath the point given by x
              and y, in window coordinates.  If the point is over a sash or a
              sash handle, the result is a two element list containing the index
              of the sash or handle, and a word indicating whether it is over a
              sash or a handle, such as {0 sash} or {2 handle}.  If the point is
              over any other part of the panedwindow, the result is an empty
              list.

       pathName proxy ?args?
              This command is used to query and change the position of the sash
              proxy, used for rubberband-style pane resizing. It can take any of
              the following forms:

              pathName proxy coord
                     Return a list containing the x and y coordinates of the
                     most recent proxy location.

              pathName proxy forget
                     Remove the proxy from the display.

              pathName proxy place x y
                     Place the proxy at the given x and y coordinates.

       pathName sash ?args?
              This command is used to query and change the position of sashes in
              the panedwindow.  It can take any of the following forms:

              pathName sash coord index
                     Return the current x and y coordinate pair for the sash
                     given by index.  Index must be an integer between 0 and 1
                     less than the number of panes in the panedwindow.  The
                     coordinates given are those of the top left corner of the
                     region containing the sash.

              pathName sash dragto index x y
                     This command computes the difference between the given
                     coordinates and the coordinates given to the last sash mark
                     command for the given sash.  It then moves that sash the
                     computed difference.  The return value is the empty string.

              pathName sash mark index x y
                     Records x and y for the sash given by index; used in
                     conjunction with later sash dragto commands to move the
                     sash.

              pathName sash place index x y
                     Place the sash given by index at the given coordinates.

       pathName panecget window option
              Query a management option for window.  Option may be any value
              allowed by the paneconfigure subcommand.

       pathName paneconfigure window ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the management options for window.  If no option
              is specified, returns a list describing all of the available
              options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on the
              format of this list).  If option is specified with no value, then
              the command returns a list describing the one named option (this
              list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value
              returned if no option is specified).  If one or more option-value
              pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given widget
              option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this case the command
              returns an empty string.  The following options are supported:

              -after window
                     Insert the window after the window specified.  window
                     should be the name of a window already managed by pathName.

              -before window
                     Insert the window before the window specified.  window
                     should be the name of a window already managed by pathName.

              -height size
                     Specify a height for the window.  The height will be the
                     outer dimension of the window including its border, if any.
                     If size is an empty string, or if -height is not specified,
                     then the height requested internally by the window will be
                     used initially; the height may later be adjusted by the
                     movement of sashes in the panedwindow.  Size may be any
                     value accepted by Tk_GetPixels.

              -hide boolean
                     Controls the visibility of a pane.  When the boolean is     │
                     true (according to Tcl_GetBoolean) the pane will not be     │
                     visible, but it will still be maintained in the list of     │
                     panes.

              -minsize n
                     Specifies that the size of the window cannot be made less
                     than n.  This constraint only affects the size of the
                     widget in the paned dimension — the x dimension for
                     horizontal panedwindows, the y dimension for vertical
                     panedwindows.  May be any value accepted by Tk_GetPixels.

              -padx n
                     Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra
                     space to leave on each side of the window in the X-
                     direction.  The value may have any of the forms accepted by
                     Tk_GetPixels.

              -pady n
                     Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra
                     space to leave on each side of the window in the Y-
                     direction.  The value may have any of the forms accepted by
                     Tk_GetPixels.

              -sticky style
                     If a window's pane is larger than the requested dimensions
                     of the window, this option may be used to position (or
                     stretch) the window within its pane.  Style  is a string
                     that contains zero or more of the characters n, s, e or w.
                     The string can optionally contains spaces or commas, but
                     they are ignored.  Each letter refers to a side (north,
                     south, east, or west) that the window will “stick” to.  If
                     both n and s (or e and w) are specified, the window will be
                     stretched to fill the entire height (or width) of its
                     cavity.

              -stretch when
                     Controls how extra space is allocated to each of the panes. │
                     When is one of always, first, last, middle, and never.  The │
                     panedwindow will calculate the required size of all its     │
                     panes. Any remaining (or deficit) space will be distributed │
                     to those panes marked for stretching. The space will be     │
                     distributed based on each panes current ratio of the whole. │
                     The when values have the following definition:              │

                     always This pane will always stretch.                       │

                     first  Only if this pane is the first pane (left-most or    │
                            top-most) will it stretch.                           │

                     last   Only if this pane is the last pane (right-most or    │
                            bottom-most) will it stretch.  This is the default   │
                            value.                                               │

                     middle Only if this pane is not the first or last pane will │
                            it stretch.                                          │

                     never  This pane will never stretch.                        │

              -width size
                     Specify a width for the window.  The width will be the
                     outer dimension of the window including its border, if any.
                     If size is an empty string, or if -width is not specified,
                     then the width requested internally by the window will be
                     used initially; the width may later be adjusted by the
                     movement of sashes in the panedwindow.  Size may be any
                     value accepted by Tk_GetPixels.

       pathName panes
              Returns an ordered list of the widgets managed by pathName.

RESIZING PANES
       A pane is resized by grabbing the sash (or sash handle if present) and
       dragging with the mouse.  This is accomplished via mouse motion bindings
       on the widget.  When a sash is moved, the sizes of the panes on each side
       of the sash, and thus the widgets in those panes, are adjusted.

       When a pane is resized from outside (e.g. it is packed to expand and
       fill, and the containing toplevel is resized), space is added to the
       final (rightmost or bottommost) pane in the window.
