DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::labeledwidget command creates a labeled widget which
       contains a label and child site.  The child site is a frame which can
       filled with any widget via a derived class or though the use of the
       childsite method.  This class was designed to be a general purpose base
       class for supporting the combination of label widget and a childsite.
       The options include the ability to position the label around the
       childsite widget, modify the font and margin, and control the display of
       the labels.


METHODS
       The iwidgets::labeledwidget command creates a new Tcl command whose name
       is pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on
       the widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following commands are possible for labeledwidget widgets:

WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName childsite
              Return the path name of the child site.

       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::labeledwidget command.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::labeledwidget command.


STATIC METHODS
       iwidgets::Labeledwidget::alignlabels widget ?widget ...?
              The alignlabels procedure takes a list of widgets derived from the
              Labeledwidget class and uses the label margin to make each widget
              have the same total space for the combination of label and margin.
              The net effect is to left align the labels.  Generally, this
              method is only useful with a label position of w, which is the
              default.


COMPONENTS
       Name:           label
       Class:          label

              The label component provides the label for the labeled widget.
              See the "label" widget manual entry for details on the label
              component item.

       Name:           lwchildsite
       Class:          frame

              The lwchildsite component is the user child site for the labeled
              widget.  See the "frame" widget manual entry for details on the
              lwchildsite component item.


EXAMPLE
              The labeledwidget was primarily meant to be a base class.  The
              ScrolledListBox and EntryField are good examples of derived
              classes of the labeledwidget class.  In order to provide equal
              support for composite classes, the 'childsite' methods also
              exists.  The following is an example of 'childsite' method usage.


               package require Iwidgets 4.0
               iwidgets::labeledwidget .lw -labeltext "Canvas Widget" -labelpos s
               pack .lw -fill both -expand yes -padx 10 -pady 10

               set cw [canvas [.lw childsite].c -relief raised -width 200 -height 200]
               pack $cw -padx 10 -pady 10
