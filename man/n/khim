DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a set of key bindings to allow a user to enter
       arbitrary characters on a keyboard that does not support them.  It works
       by designating some seldom-used key of the keyboard as a "Compose" key
       (this key is distinct from any key so labeled, and is often "Pause,"
       "F12" or "L2"), and having the "Compose" key, followed by a two-key
       sequence, have the effect of inserting some character in a widget.  In
       addition, the "Compose" key, when struck twice in succession, brings up a
       dialog containing a Unicode character map, allowing arbitrary characters
       to be inserted.

       The vast bulk of the package's functionality is implemented in a single
       bindtag, KHIM.  An application can request that any text or entry widget
       use the package to allow for entry of arbitrary characters by placing
       this binding tag ahead of the Text or Entry binding tag for the widget:

       text .t -width 80 -height 24
       bindtags .t {.t KHIM Text . all}


       Note that the KHIM tag must precede the Text or Entry class binding, or
       the package will not function correctly.



PROCEDURES
       In addition to commands supporting the KHIM binding tag, the following
       commands are exported from the package:





       ::khim::getOptions path


              Posts a top-level modal dialog with the path name path that
              prompts the user for KHIM options.  The user is allowed to
              reconfigure the key sequences for the "Compose" key, change the
              choice of key to use for the "Compose" function, and
              enable/disable the KHIM key bindings entirely.



       ::khim::getConfig


              Returns a Tcl script that restores the current configuration of
              KHIM: the enabled/disabled state, the choice of "Compose" key, and
              the key sequences that may be composed.  This script is designed
              to be saved to a configuration file for use in a subsequent
              invocation of the same application:




              # Save KHIM configuration
              set f [open ~/.khimrc w]
              puts $f [::khim::getConfig]
              close $f

              # Restore KHIM configuration
              source ~/.khimrc


       ::khim::setConfig version enabled compose map
              Restores an earlier saved configuration.  Few, if any,
              applications will call this command in any other way than to
              evaluate it as returned from ::khim::getConfig.

       ::khim::showHelp path
              Displays a top-level dialog giving user-level help for KHIM; the
              dialog will have the path name path.

LOCALISATION
       Programmers who wish to make KHIM available in a non-English-speaking
       locale may do so by providing a .msg file with the appropriate localised
       text.  The catalog requires the following messages:

       Apply  Text that will appear on the "Apply" button in the dialog that
              sets KHIM options.

       Cancel Text that will appear on the "Cancel" button in several dialogs.

       Change Text that will appear on the "Change" button, which alters the
              binding of a pair of composed characters (creating or replacing as
              appropriate).

       Character
              Text that will appear on the label of the entry widget that
              accepts a character resulting from a composed sequence.

       {Compose Key}
              Window title for a dialog that prompts the user to strike the key
              that will be used for the "Compose" key.

       {Compose key:}
              Label that identifies a component showing the "Compose" key choice
              in the KHIM options dialog.

       {Composed sequence must be two characters long}
              Error message that is displayed if the user attempts to define a
              "Compose" sequence that is shorter or longer than two characters.

       Delete Text for a button that deletes a "Compose" sequence.

       Help...
              Text for a button that displays the KHIM user help dialog.

       HELPTEXT
              Complete text for the user-level help for KHIM.  Refer to "en.msg"
              for the English-language version of the help.

       {Input key sequence}
              Text for a label of the entry widget that prompts the user for a
              two-character sequence to use with the "Compose" key.

       {Insert Character}
              Window title of the dialog box that displays a Unicode character
              map and prompts the user to select a character to insert.

       {Key sequences}
              Text for a label at the head of a listbox showing the composed
              sequences that are currently bound.

       {KHIM Controls}
              Window title for the dialog box that prompts for KHIM settings.

       {KHIM Help}
              Window title for the window that display help text for KHIM.

       OK     Label for the OK button on several dialogs.

       Select code page:
              Label for a spinbox that prompts the user for a Unicode code page
              number.

       SELECT COMPOSE KEY
              A message, which should be composed in short lines, prompting the
              user to press the key that will become the "Compose" key in KHIM.

       Unicode...
              Text for a button that brings up the character map to select the
              character to which a composed sequence binds.

       {Use KHIM}
              Text for a checkbutton that asks whether the user wishes to use
              KHIM to manage composed key sequences.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
       KHIM was originally inspired by the key bindings that Brent Welch
       developed for the 'sedit' editor used in the 'exmh' mail user agent.  The
       code for KHIM is entirely separate from that for 'sedit'.
