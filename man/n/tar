DESCRIPTION
       ::tar::contents tarball
              Returns a list of the files contained in tarball. The order is not
              sorted and depends on the order files were stored in the archive.


       ::tar::stat tarball ?file?
              Returns a nested dict containing information on the named ?file?
              in tarball, or all files if none is specified. The top level are
              pairs of filename and info. The info is a dict with the keys "mode
              uid gid size mtime type linkname uname gname devmajor devminor

              % ::tar::stat tarball.tar
              foo.jpg {mode 0644 uid 1000 gid 0 size 7580 mtime 811903867 type file linkname {} uname user gname wheel devmajor 0 devminor 0}


       ::tar::untar tarball args
              Extracts tarball. -file and -glob limit the extraction to files
              which exactly match or pattern match the given argument. No error
              is thrown if no files match. Returns a list of filenames extracted
              and the file size. The size will be null for non regular files.
              Leading path seperators are stripped so paths will always be
              relative.

              -dir dirName
                     Directory to extract to. Uses pwd if none is specified

              -file fileName
                     Only extract the file with this name. The name is matched
                     against the complete path stored in the archive including
                     directories.

              -glob pattern
                     Only extract files patching this glob style pattern. The
                     pattern is matched against the complete path stored in the
                     archive.

              -nooverwrite
                     Dont overwrite files that already exist

              -nomtime
                     Leave the file modification time as the current time
                     instead of setting it to the value in the archive.

              -noperms
                     In Unix, leave the file permissions as the current umask
                     instead of setting them to the values in the archive.


       % foreach {file size} [::tar::untar tarball.tar -glob *.jpg] {
       puts "Extracted $file ($size bytes)"
       }


       ::tar::get tarball fileName
              Returns the contents of fileName from the tarball


              % set readme [::tar::get tarball.tar doc/README] {
              % puts $readme
              }


       ::tar::create tarball files args
              Creates a new tar file containing the files. files must be
              specified as a single argument which is a proper list of
              filenames.

              -dereference
                     Normally create will store links as an actual link pointing
                     at a file that may or may not exist in the archive.
                     Specifying this option will cause the actual file point to
                     by the link to be stored instead.


       % ::tar::create new.tar [glob -nocomplain file*]
       % ::tar::contents new.tar
       file1 file2 file3


       ::tar::add tarball files args
              Appends files to the end of the existing tarball. files must be
              specified as a single argument which is a proper list of
              filenames.

              -dereference
                     Normally add will store links as an actual link pointing at
                     a file that may or may not exist in the archive. Specifying
                     this option will cause the actual file point to by the link
                     to be stored instead.

              -prefix string
                     Normally add will store files under exactly the name
                     specified as argument. Specifying a ?-prefix? causes the
                     string to be prepended to every name.

              -quick The only sure way to find the position in the tarball where
                     new files can be added is to read it from start, but if
                     tarball was written with a "blocksize" of 1 (as this
                     package does) then one can alternatively find this position
                     by seeking from the end. The ?-quick? option tells add to
                     do the latter.


       ::tar::remove tarball files
              Removes files from the tarball. No error will result if the file
              does not exist in the tarball. Directory write permission and free
              disk space equivalent to at least the size of the tarball will be
              needed.

              % ::tar::remove new.tar {file2 file3}
              % ::tar::contents new.tar
              file3
