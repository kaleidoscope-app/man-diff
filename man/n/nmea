DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a standard interface for writing software which
       recieves NMEA standard input data. It allows for reading data from COM
       ports, files, or programmatic input. It also supports the checksumming
       and logging of incoming data.  After parsing, input is dispatched to user
       defined handler commands for processing.  To define a handler, see the
       event command. There are no GPS specific functions in this package. NMEA
       data consists of a sentence type, followed by a list of data.

COMMANDS
       ::nmea::input sentence
              Processes and dispatches the supplied sentence. If sentence
              contains no commas it is treated as a Tcl list, otherwise it must
              be standard comma delimited NMEA data, with an optional checksum
              and leading $.

              nmea::input {$GPGSA,A,3,04,05,,09,12,,,24,,,,,2.5,1.3,2.1*39}
              nmea::input [list GPGSA A 3 04 05  09 12 "" "" 24 "" "" ""  2.5 1.3 2.1]


       ::nmea::open_port port ?speed?
              Open the specified COM port and read NMEA sentences when
              available. Port speed is set to 4800bps by default or to speed.

       ::nmea::close_port
              Close the com port connection if one is open.

       ::nmea::configure_port settings
              Changes the current port settings. settings has the same format as
              fconfigure -mode.

       ::nmea::open_file file ?rate?
              Open file file and read NMEA sentences, one per line, at the rate
              specified by ?rate? in milliseconds.  The file format may omit the
              leading $ and/or the checksum. If rate is <= 0 (the default) then
              lines will only be processed when a call to do_line is made.

       ::nmea::close_file
              Close the open file if one exists.

       ::nmea::do_line
              If there is a currently open file, this command will read and
              process a single line from it.  Returns the number of lines read.

       ::nmea::rate
              Sets the rate at which lines are processed from the open file, in
              milliseconds. The rate remains consistant across files, there does
              not need to be a file currently open to use this command.  Set to
              0 to disable automatic line processing.

       ::nmea::log ?file?
              Starts or stops input logging. If a file name is specified then
              all NMEA data recieved on the open port will be logged to the
              ?file? in append mode. If file is an empty string then any logging
              will be stopped. If no file is specified then returns a boolean
              value indicating if logging is currently enabled. Data written to
              the port by write, data read from files, or input made using
              input, is not logged.

       ::nmea::checksum data
              Returns the checksum of the supplied data.

       ::nmea::write sentence data
              If there is a currently open port, this command will write the
              specified sentence and data to the port in proper NMEA checksummed
              format.

       ::nmea::event setence ?command?
              Registers a handler proc for a given NMEA sentence. There may be
              at most one handler per sentence, any existing handler is
              replaced.  If no command is specified, returns the name of the
              current handler for the given setence or an empty string if none
              exists. In addition to the incoming sentences there are 2 builtin
              types, EOF and DEFAULT. The handler for the DEFAULT setence is
              invoked if there is not a specific handler for that sentence. The
              EOF handler is invoked when End Of File is reached on the open
              file or port.

              The handler procedures, with the exception of the builtin
              types,must take exactly one argument, which is a list of the data
              values.  The DEFAULT handler should have two arguments, the
              sentence type and the data values.  The EOF handler has no
              arguments.

              nmea::event gpgsa parse_sat_detail
              nmea::event default handle_unknown

              proc parse_sat_detail {data} {
                  puts [lindex $data 1]
              }

              proc handle_unknown {name data} {
                  puts "unknown data type $name"
              }
