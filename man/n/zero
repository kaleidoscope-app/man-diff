NAME
       zero - Create and manipulate zero channels

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tcl

       package require memchan

       zero

________________________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       The command described here is only available in a not-yet released
       version of the package. Use the CVS to get the sources.

       zero   creates a zero channel which absorbs everything written into it.
              Reading from a zero channel will return the requested number of
              null bytes. These channels are essentially Tcl-specific variants
              of the zero device for unixoid operating systems (/dev/zero).
              Transfering the generated channel between interpreters is possible
              but does not make much sense.

OPTIONS
       Memory channels created by zero provide one additional option to set or
       query.

       -delay ?milliseconds?
              A zero channel is always writable and readable. This means that
              all fileevent-handlers will fire continuously.  To avoid
              starvation of other event sources the events raised by this
              channel type have a configurable delay. This option is set in
              milliseconds and defaults to 5.
