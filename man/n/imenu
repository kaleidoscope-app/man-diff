DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a class for the creation of a simple menu control.

CLASS API
       The package exports a single command, the class command, enabling the
       creation of menu instances. Its API is:

       term::interact::menu object dict ?options...?
              This command creates a new menu object with the name object,
              initializes it, and returns the fully qualified name of the object
              command as its result.

              The argument is the menu to show, possibly followed by
              configuration options and their values. The options are explained
              in the section Configuration. The menu is a dictionary maping
              labels to symbolic action codes.

OBJECT API
       The objects created by the class command provide the methods listed
       below:

       object interact
              Shows the menu in the screen at the configured location and starts
              interacting with it. This opens its own event loop for the
              processing of incoming characters. The method returns when the
              interaction has completed. See section Interaction for a
              description of the possible interaction.

              The method returns the symbolic action of the menu item selected
              by the user at the end of the interaction.

       object done
              This method can be used by user supplied actions to terminate the
              interaction with the object.

       object clear
              This method can be used by user supplied actions to remove the
              menu from the terminal.

       object configure

       object configure option

       object configure option value...

       object cget option
              Standard methods to retrieve and configure the options of the
              menu.

CONFIGURATION
       A menu instance recognizes the following options:

       -in chan
              Specifies the channel to read character sequences from. Defaults
              to stdin.

       -out chan
              Specifies the channel to write the menu contents to. Defaults to
              stdout.

       -column int
              Specifies the column of the terminal where the left margin of the
              menu display should appear. Defaults to 0, i.e. the left-most
              column.

       -line int
              Specifies the line of the terminal where the top margin of the
              menu display should appear. Defaults to 0, i.e. the top-most line.

       -height int
              Specifies the number of lines of text to show at most in the
              display. Defaults to 25.

       -actions dict
              Specifies a dictionary containing additional actions, using
              character sequences as keys. Note that these sequences cannot
              override the hardwired sequences described in section Interaction.

       -hilitleft int

       -hilitright int
              By default the entire selected menu entry is highlighted in revers
              output. However, when present these two options restrict revers
              dispay to the specified sub-range of the entry.

       -framed bool
              By default the menu is shown using only header and footer out of
              characters box graphics. If this flag is set the menu is fully
              enclosed in a box.

INTERACTION
       A menu object recognizes the control sequences listed below and acts as
       described. The user can supply more control sequences to act on via the
       configuration, but is not able to overide these defaults.

       Cursor Up
              The selection is moved up one entry, except if the first entry of
              the menu is already selected.

       Cursor Down
              The selection is moved down one entry, except if the last entry of
              the menu is already selected.

       Enter/Return
              The interaction with the object is terminated.
