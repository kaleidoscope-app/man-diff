WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       Name:           height
       Class:          Height
       Command-Line Switch:           -height

              Specifies the height of the scrolled text as an entire unit.  The
              value may be specified in any of the forms acceptable to
              Tk_GetPixels.  Any additional space needed to display the other
              components such as labels, margins, and scrollbars force the text
              to be compressed.  A value of zero along with the same value for
              the width causes the value given for the visibleitems option to be
              applied which administers geometry constraints in a different
              manner.  The default height is zero.

       Name:           hscrollMode
       Class:          ScrollMode
       Command-Line Switch:           -hscrollmode

              Specifies the the display mode to be used for the horizontal
              scrollbar: static, dynamic, or none.  In static mode, the scroll
              bar is displayed at all times.  Dynamic mode displays the scroll
              bar as required, and none disables the scroll bar display.  The
              default is static.

       Name:           sbWidth
       Class:          Width
       Command-Line Switch:           -sbwidth

              Specifies the width of the scrollbar in any of the forms
              acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.

       Name:           scrollMargin
       Class:          Margin
       Command-Line Switch:           -scrollmargin

              Specifies the distance between the text area and scrollbar in any
              of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.  The default is 3 pixels.

       Name:           textBackground
       Class:          Background
       Command-Line Switch:           -textbackground

              Specifies the background color for the text area in any of the
              forms acceptable to Tk_GetColor.

       Name:           textFont
       Class:          Font
       Command-Line Switch:           -textfont

              Specifies the font to be used in the scrolled text area.

       Name:           visibleitems
       Class:          VisibleItems
       Command-Line Switch:           -visibleitems

              Specifies the widthxheight in characters and lines for the text.
              This option is only administered if the width and height options
              are both set to zero, otherwise they take precedence.  The default
              value is 80x24.  With the visibleitems option engaged, geometry
              constraints are maintained only on the text.  The size of the
              other components such as labels, margins, and scroll bars, are
              additive and independent, effecting the overall size of the
              scrolled text.  In contrast, should the width and height options
              have non zero values, they are applied to the scrolled text as a
              whole.  The text is compressed or expanded to maintain the
              geometry constraints.

       Name:           vscrollMode
       Class:          ScrollMode
       Command-Line Switch:           -vscrollmode

              Specifies the the display mode to be used for the vertical
              scrollbar: static, dynamic, or none.  In static mode, the scroll
              bar is displayed at all times.  Dynamic mode displays the scroll
              bar as required, and none disables the scroll bar display.  The
              default is static.

       Name:           width
       Class:          Width
       Command-Line Switch:           -width

              Specifies the width of the scrolled text as an entire unit.  The
              value may be specified in any of the forms acceptable to
              Tk_GetPixels.  Any additional space needed to display the other
              components such as labels, margins, and scrollbars force the text
              to be compressed.  A value of zero along with the same value for
              the height causes the value given for the visibleitems option to
              be applied which administers geometry constraints in a different
              manner.  The default width is zero.

DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::scrolledtext command creates a scrolled text widget with
       additional options to manage the scrollbars.  This includes options to
       control the method in which the scrollbars are displayed, i.e. statically
       or  dynamically.  Options also exist for adding a label to the scrolled
       text area and controlling its position.  Import/export of methods are
       provided for file I/O.


METHODS
       The iwidgets::scrolledtext command creates a new Tcl command whose name
       is pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on
       the widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following commands are possible for scrolledtext widgets:

       see             tag            window          xview
       yview

       See the "text" manual entry for details on the standard methods.


WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::scrolledtext command.

       pathName childsite
              Returns the child site widget path name.

       pathName clear
              Clear the text area of all characters.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::scrolledtext command.

       pathName import filename ?index?
              Load the text from a file into the text area at the index.  The
              filename must exist.

       pathName export filename
              Write text to a file.  If filename exists then contents are
              replaced with text widget contents.
