SYNOPSIS
       ttk::scrollbar pathName ?options...?
________________________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       ttk::scrollbar widgets are typically linked to an associated window that
       displays a document of some sort, such as a file being edited or a
       drawing.  A scrollbar displays a thumb in the middle portion of the
       scrollbar, whose position and size provides information about the portion
       of the document visible in the associated window.  The thumb may be
       dragged by the user to control the visible region.  Depending on the
       theme, two or more arrow buttons may also be present; these are used to
       scroll the visible region in discrete units.

STANDARD OPTIONS
       -class                -cursor              -style
       -takefocus

       See the ttk_widget manual entry for details on the standard options.

WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       [-command command] A Tcl script prefix to evaluate to change the view in
       the widget associated with the scrollbar.  Additional arguments are
       appended to the value of this option, as described in SCROLLING COMMANDS
       below, whenever the user requests a view change by manipulating the
       scrollbar.

              This option typically consists of a two-element list, containing
              the name of a scrollable widget followed by either xview (for
              horizontal scrollbars) or yview (for vertical scrollbars).
       [-orient orient] One of horizontal or vertical.  Specifies the
       orientation of the scrollbar.

WIDGET COMMAND
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the specified option; see
              ttk::widget(n).

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Modify or query widget options; see ttk::widget(n).

       pathName get
              Returns the scrollbar settings in the form of a list whose
              elements are the arguments to the most recent set widget command.

       pathName identify x y
              Returns the name of the element at position x, y.  See
              ttk::widget(n).

       pathName instate statespec ?script?
              Test the widget state; see ttk::widget(n).

       pathName set first last
              This command is normally invoked by the scrollbar's associated
              widget from an -xscrollcommand or -yscrollcommand callback.
              Specifies the visible range to be displayed.  first and last are
              real fractions between 0 and 1.

       pathName state ?stateSpec?
              Modify or query the widget state; see ttk::widget(n).

INTERNAL COMMANDS
       The following widget commands are used internally by the TScrollbar
       widget class bindings.

       pathName delta deltaX deltaY
              Returns a real number indicating the fractional change in the
              scrollbar setting that corresponds to a given change in thumb
              position.  For example, if the scrollbar is horizontal, the result
              indicates how much the scrollbar setting must change to move the
              thumb deltaX pixels to the right (deltaY is ignored in this case).
              If the scrollbar is vertical, the result indicates how much the
              scrollbar setting must change to move the thumb deltaY pixels
              down.  The arguments and the result may be zero or negative.

       pathName fraction x y
              Returns a real number between 0 and 1 indicating where the point
              given by x and y lies in the trough area of the scrollbar, where
              0.0 corresponds to the top or left of the trough and 1.0
              corresponds to the bottom or right.  X and y are pixel coordinates
              relative to the scrollbar widget.  If x and y refer to a point
              outside the trough, the closest point in the trough is used.

SCROLLING COMMANDS
       When the user interacts with the scrollbar, for example by dragging the
       thumb, the scrollbar notifies the associated widget that it must change
       its view.  The scrollbar makes the notification by evaluating a Tcl
       command generated from the scrollbar's -command option.  The command may
       take any of the following forms.  In each case, prefix is the contents of
       the -command option, which usually has a form like .t yview

       prefix moveto fraction
              Fraction is a real number between 0 and 1.  The widget should
              adjust its view so that the point given by fraction appears at the
              beginning of the widget.  If fraction is 0 it refers to the
              beginning of the document.  1.0 refers to the end of the document,
              0.333 refers to a point one-third of the way through the document,
              and so on.

       prefix scroll number units
              The widget should adjust its view by number units.  The units are
              defined in whatever way makes sense for the widget, such as
              characters or lines in a text widget.  Number is either 1, which
              means one unit should scroll off the top or left of the window, or
              -1, which means that one unit should scroll off the bottom or
              right of the window.

       prefix scroll number pages
              The widget should adjust its view by number pages.  It is up to
              the widget to define the meaning of a page;  typically it is
              slightly less than what fits in the window, so that there is a
              slight overlap between the old and new views.  Number is either 1,
              which means the next page should become visible, or -1, which
              means that the previous page should become visible.

WIDGET STATES
       The scrollbar automatically sets the disabled state bit.  when the entire
       range is visible (range is 0.0 to 1.0), and clears it otherwise.  It also
       sets the active and pressed state flags of individual elements, based on
       the position and state of the mouse pointer.

EXAMPLE
              set f [frame .f]
              ttk::scrollbar $f.hsb -orient horizontal -command [list $f.t xview]
              ttk::scrollbar $f.vsb -orient vertical -command [list $f.t yview]
              text $f.t -xscrollcommand [list $f.hsb set] -yscrollcommand [list $f.vsb set]
              grid $f.t -row 0 -column 0 -sticky nsew
              grid $f.vsb -row 0 -column 1 -sticky nsew
              grid $f.hsb -row 1 -column 0 -sticky nsew
              grid columnconfigure $f 0 -weight 1
              grid rowconfigure $f 0 -weight 1
