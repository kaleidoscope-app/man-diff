DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a widget for the entering of a IP address.

       ::ipentry::ipentry pathName ?option value...?
              Creates a new IPv4 ipentry widget and configures it with the given
              options and their values.

       ::ipentry::ipentry6 pathName ?option value...?
              Creates a new ipentry widget for the entry of an IPv6 address. All
              options are the same as the IPv4 widget.

       Each widget created with the command above supports the following
       methods:

       pathName complete
              Returns a boolean value. True indicates that the entry contains a
              complete IP address, meaning all fields have a value. In some
              cases IPv6 address are valid when fields are missing. You will
              need to do your own validation to detect this.

       pathName get
              Returns the contents of the entry as a list consisting of 4 or 8
              elements.

       pathName insert iplist
              IPv4 Takes a list of 4 elements and inserts one into each quad of
              the entry, in order.  All values in the list must be empty or
              integers. Values outside the range 0 to 255 are modified to be
              within the range.  IPv6 Takes a list of 8 elements and inserts one
              into each quad of the entry, in order.  All values in the list
              must be empty or 1 to 4 hex digits.

       pathName icursor index
              Sets the position of the widgets insertion cursor. Only integer
              values between 0 and 15 are valid for ipentry and 0 to 31 for
              ipentry6.  Setting the icursor will only have an effect if the
              widget already has the input focus.

       pathName configure option value...
              Modifies the configuration of the widget. For options and their
              meaning see the widget options section.

       pathName cget option
              Returns information about the current configuration of the widget,
              for the specified option. For options and their meaning see the
              widget options section.
