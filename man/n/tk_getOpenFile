tk_getOpenFile(n)             Tk Built-In Commands             tk_getOpenFile(n)



________________________________________________________________________________

NAME
       tk_getOpenFile, tk_getSaveFile - pop up a dialog box for the user to
       select a file to open or save.

SYNOPSIS
       tk_getOpenFile ?option value ...?
       tk_getSaveFile ?option value ...?
________________________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       The procedures tk_getOpenFile and tk_getSaveFile pop up a dialog box for
       the user to select a file to open or save. The tk_getOpenFile command is
       usually associated with the Open command in the File menu. Its purpose is
       for the user to select an existing file only. If the user enters a non-
       existent file, the dialog box gives the user an error prompt and requires
       the user to give an alternative selection. If an application allows the
       user to create new files, it should do so by providing a separate New
       menu command.

       The tk_getSaveFile command is usually associated with the Save as command
       in the File menu. If the user enters a file that already exists, the
       dialog box prompts the user for confirmation whether the existing file
       should be overwritten or not.

       The following option-value pairs are possible as command line arguments
       to these two commands:

       -defaultextension extension
              Specifies a string that will be appended to the filename if the
              user enters a filename without an extension. The default value is
              the empty string, which means no extension will be appended to the
              filename in any case. This option is ignored on Mac OS X, which
              does not require extensions to filenames, and the UNIX
              implementation guesses reasonable values for this from the
              -filetypes option when this is not supplied.

       -filetypes filePatternList
              If a File types listbox exists in the file dialog on the
              particular platform, this option gives the filetypes in this
              listbox. When the user choose a filetype in the listbox, only the
              files of that type are listed. If this option is unspecified, or
              if it is set to the empty list, or if the File types listbox is
              not supported by the particular platform then all files are listed
              regardless of their types. See the section SPECIFYING FILE
              PATTERNS below for a discussion on the contents of
              filePatternList.

       -initialdir directory
              Specifies that the files in directory should be displayed when the
              dialog pops up. If this parameter is not specified, then the files
              in the current working directory are displayed. If the parameter
              specifies a relative path, the return value will convert the
              relative path to an absolute path.

       -initialfile filename
              Specifies a filename to be displayed in the dialog when it pops
              up.

       -message string
              Specifies a message to include in the client area of the dialog.
              This is only available on Mac OS X.

       -multiple boolean
              Allows the user to choose multiple files from the Open dialog.

       -parent window
              Makes window the logical parent of the file dialog. The file
              dialog is displayed on top of its parent window. On Mac OS X, this
              turns the file dialog into a sheet attached to the parent window.

       -title titleString
              Specifies a string to display as the title of the dialog box. If
              this option is not specified, then a default title is displayed.

       -typevariable variableName
              The global variable variableName is used to preselect which filter
              is used from filterList when the dialog box is opened and is
              updated when the dialog box is closed, to the last selected
              filter. The variable is read once at the beginning to select the
              appropriate filter. If the variable does not exist, or its value
              does not match any filter typename, or is empty ({}), the dialog
              box will revert to the default behavior of selecting the first
              filter in the list. If the dialog is canceled, the variable is not
              modified.

       If the user selects a file, both tk_getOpenFile and tk_getSaveFile return
       the full pathname of this file. If the user cancels the operation, both
       commands return the empty string.

SPECIFYING FILE PATTERNS
       The filePatternList value given by the -filetypes option is a list of
       file patterns. Each file pattern is a list of the form
              typeName {extension ?extension ...?} ?{macType ?macType ...?}?
       typeName is the name of the file type described by this file pattern and
       is the text string that appears in the File types listbox. extension is a
       file extension for this file pattern.  macType is a four-character
       Macintosh file type. The list of macTypes is optional and may be omitted
       for applications that do not need to execute on the Macintosh platform.

       Several file patterns may have the same typeName, in which case they
       refer to the same file type and share the same entry in the listbox. When
       the user selects an entry in the listbox, all the files that match at
       least one of the file patterns corresponding to that entry are listed.
       Usually, each file pattern corresponds to a distinct type of file. The
       use of more than one file pattern for one type of file is only necessary
       on the Macintosh platform.

       On the Macintosh platform, a file matches a file pattern if its name
       matches at least one of the extension(s) AND it belongs to at least one
       of the macType(s) of the file pattern. For example, the C Source Files
       file pattern in the sample code matches with files that have a .c
       extension AND belong to the macType TEXT. To use the OR rule instead, you
       can use two file patterns, one with the extensions only and the other
       with the macType only. The GIF Files file type in the sample code matches
       files that either have a .gif extension OR belong to the macType GIFF.

       On the Unix and Windows platforms, a file matches a file pattern if its
       name matches at least one of the extension(s) of the file pattern. The
       macTypes are ignored.

SPECIFYING EXTENSIONS
       On the Unix and Macintosh platforms, extensions are matched using glob-
       style pattern matching. On the Windows platform, extensions are matched
       by the underlying operating system. The types of possible extensions are:

       (1)    the special extension “*” matches any file;

       (2)    the special extension matches any files that do not have an
              extension (i.e., the filename contains no full stop character);

       (3)    any character string that does not contain any wild card
              characters (* and ?).

       Due to the different pattern matching rules on the various platforms, to
       ensure portability, wild card characters are not allowed in the
       extensions, except as in the special extension “*”.  Extensions without a
       full stop character (e.g.  “~”) are allowed but may not work on all
       platforms.  <>

EXAMPLE
              set types {
                  {{Text Files}       {.txt}        }
                  {{TCL Scripts}      {.tcl}        }
                  {{C Source Files}   {.c}      TEXT}
                  {{GIF Files}        {.gif}        }
                  {{GIF Files}        {}        GIFF}
                  {{All Files}        *             }
              }
              set filename [tk_getOpenFile -filetypes $types]

              if {$filename != ""} {
                  # Open the file ...
              }
