NAME
       uuid - UUID generation and comparison

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tcl  8.2

       package require uuid  ?1.0.1?

       ::uuid::uuid generate

       ::uuid::uuid equal id1 id2

________________________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a generator of universally unique identifiers
       (UUID) also known as globally unique identifiers (GUID). This
       implementation follows the draft specification from (1) although this is
       actually an expired draft document.

COMMANDS
       ::uuid::uuid generate
              Creates a type 4 uuid by MD5 hashing a number of bits of variant
              data including the time and hostname.  Returns the string
              representation of the new uuid.

       ::uuid::uuid equal id1 id2
              Compares two uuids and returns true if both arguments are the same
              uuid.

EXAMPLES

       % uuid::uuid generate
       b12dc22c-5c36-41d2-57da-e29d0ef5839c
