NAME
       platform::shell - System identification support code and utilities

SYNOPSIS
       package require platform::shell ?1.1.4?

       platform::shell::generic shell
       platform::shell::identify shell
       platform::shell::platform shell

DESCRIPTION
       The platform::shell package provides several utility commands useful for
       the identification of the architecture of a specific Tcl shell.

       This package allows the identification of the architecture of a specific
       Tcl shell different from the shell running the package. The only
       requirement is that the other shell (identified by its path), is actually
       executable on the current machine.

       While for most platform this means that the architecture of the
       interrogated shell is identical to the architecture of the running shell
       this is not generally true. A counter example are all platforms which
       have 32 and 64 bit variants and where a 64bit system is able to run 32bit
       code. For these running and interrogated shell may have different 32/64
       bit settings and thus different identifiers.

       For applications like a code repository it is important to identify the
       architecture of the shell which will actually run the installed packages,
       versus the architecture of the shell running the repository software.

COMMANDS
       platform::shell::identify shell
              This command does the same identification as platform::identify,
              for the specified Tcl shell, in contrast to the running shell.

       platform::shell::generic shell
              This command does the same identification as platform::generic,
              for the specified Tcl shell, in contrast to the running shell.

       platform::shell::platform shell
              This command returns the contents of tcl_platform(platform) for
              the specified Tcl shell.

KEYWORDS
       operating system, cpu architecture, platform, architecture
