DESCRIPTION
       This package provides commands for encoding and decoding of strings into
       and out of the extended hex base32 encoding as specified in the RFC
       3548bis draft.

API
       ::base32::hex::encode string
              This command encodes the given string in extended hex base32 and
              returns the encoded string as its result. The result may be padded
              with the character = to signal a partial encoding at the end of
              the input string.

       ::base32::hex::decode estring
              This commands takes the estring and decodes it under the
              assumption that it is a valid extended hex base32 encoded string.
              The result of the decoding is returned as the result of the
              command.

              Note that while the encoder will generate only uppercase
              characters this decoder accepts input in lowercase as well.

              The command will always throw an error whenever encountering
              conditions which signal some type of bogus input, namely if

              [1]    the input contains characters which are not valid output of
                     a extended hex base32 encoder,

              [2]    the length of the input is not a multiple of eight,

              [3]    padding appears not at the end of input, but in the middle,

              [4]    the padding has not of length six, four, three, or one
                     characters,

CODE MAP
       The code map used to convert 5-bit sequences is shown below, with the
       numeric id of the bit sequences to the left and the character used to
       encode it to the right. The important feature of the extended hex mapping
       is that the first 16 codes map to the digits and hex characters.
