       ::ident::query socket ?callback?

________________________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       The ident package provides a client implementation of the ident protocol
       as defined in RFC 1413 (http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1413.txt).

       ::ident::query socket ?callback?
              This command queries the ident daemon on the remote side of the
              given socket, and returns the result of the query as a dictionary.
              Interpreting the dictionary as list the first key will always be
              resp-type, and can have one of the values USERID, ERROR, and
              FATAL.  These response types have the following meanings:

              USERID This indicates a successful response. Two more keys and
                     associated values are returned, opsys, and user-id.

              ERROR  This means the ident server has returned an error.  A
                     second key named error is present whose value contains the
                     error-type field from the server response.

              FATAL  Fatal errors happen when no ident server is listening on
                     the remote side, or when the ident server gives a response
                     that does not conform to the RFC. A detailed error message
                     is returned under the error key.
