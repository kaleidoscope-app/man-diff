DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a single command for the convenient creation of
       procedures which delegate the actual work to a remote location via a
       "channel" created by the package comm.

API
       ::interp::delegate::proc ?-async? name arguments comm id
              This commands creates a procedure which is named by name and
              returns its fully-qualified name. All invokations of this
              procedure will delegate the actual work to the remote location
              identified by the comm channel comm and the endpoint id.

              The name of the remote procedure invoked by the delegator is
              [namespace tail name]. I.e., namespace information is stripped
              from the call.

              Normally the generated procedure marshalls the arguments, and
              returns the result from the remote procedure as its own result. If
              however the option -async was specified then the generated
              procedure will not wait for a result and return immediately.
