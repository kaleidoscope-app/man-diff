NAME
       dump - Dump information about Tcl interpreter in TkCon

SYNOPSIS
       dump method ?-nocomplain? ?-filter pattern? ?--? pattern ?pattern ...?

________________________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       The dump command provides a way for the user to spit out state
       information about the interpreter in a Tcl readable (and human readable)
       form.  It takes the general form:

       dump method ?-nocomplain? ?-filter pattern? ?--? pattern ?pattern ...?

       The patterns represent glob-style patterns (as in string match pattern
       $str).  -nocomplain will prevent dump from throwing an error if no items
       matched the pattern.  -filter is interpreted as appropriate for the
       method.  The various methods are:

       dump command args
              Outputs one or more commands.

       dump procedure args
              Outputs one or more procs in sourceable form.

       dump variable args
              Outputs the values of variables in sourceable form.  Recognizes
              nested arrays.  The -filter pattern is used as to filter array
              element names and is interepreted as a glob pattern (defaults to
              {*}).  It is passed down for nested arrays.

       dump widget args
              Outputs one or more widgets by giving their configuration options.
              The -filter pattern is used as to filter the config options and is
              interpreted as a case insensitive regexp pattern (defaults to
              {.*}).
