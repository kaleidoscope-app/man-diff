DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a class for managing a cache of tiles for slippy-
       based maps in the local filesystem.

API
       ::map::slippy::cache cacheName cachedir provider
              Creates the cache cacheName and configures it with both the path
              to the directory contaiing the locally cached tiles (cachedir),
              and the command prefix from which it will pull tiles asked for and
              not yet known to the cache itself (provider).

              The result of the command is cacheName.

   METHODS
       cacheName valid tile ?msgvar?
              This method checks the validity of a the given tile identifier.
              This is a convenience wrapper to ::map::slippy tile valid and has
              the same interface.

       cacheName exists tile
              This methods tests whether the cache contains the specified tile
              or not. The result is a boolean value, true if the tile is known,
              and false otherwise. The tile is identified by a list containing
              three elements, zoom level, row, and column number, in this order.

       cacheName get tile donecmd
              This is the main method of the cache, retrieving the image for the
              specified tile from the cache. The tile identifier is a list
              containing three elements, the zoom level, row, and column number
              of the tile, in this order.

              The command refix donecmd will be invoked when the cache either
              knows the image for the tile or that no image will forthcoming.
              It will be invoked with either 2 or 3 arguments, i.e.

              [1]    The string set, the tile, and the image.

              [2]    The string unset, and the tile.
       These two possibilities are used to either signal the image for the tile,
       or that the tile has no image defined for it.

       When the cache has no information about the tile it will invoke the
       provider command prefix specified during its construction, adding three
       arguments: The string get, the tile, and a callback into the cache. The
       latter will be invoked by the provider to either transfer the image to
       the cache, or signal that the tile has no image.

       When multiple requests for the same tile are made only one request will
       be issued to the provider.
