NAME
       otp - One-Time Passwords

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tcl  8.2

       package require otp  ?1.0.0?

       ::otp::otp-md4 ?-hex? ?-words? -seed seed -count count data

       ::otp::otp-md5 ?-hex? ?-words? -seed seed -count count data

       ::otp::otp-sha1 ?-hex? ?-words? -seed seed -count count data

       ::otp::otp-rmd160 ?-hex? ?-words? -seed seed -count count data

DESCRIPTION
       This package is an implementation in Tcl of the One-Time Password system
       as described in RFC 2289 (1). This system uses message-digest algorithms
       to sequentially hash a passphrase to create single-use passwords. The
       resulting data is then provided to the user as either hexadecimal digits
       or encoded using a dictionary of 2048 words. This system is used by
       OpenBSD for secure login and can be used as a SASL mechanism for
       authenticating users.

       In this implementation we provide support for four algorithms that are
       included in the tcllib distribution: MD5 (2), MD4 (3), RIPE-MD160 (4) and
       SHA-1 (5).

COMMANDS
       ::otp::otp-md4 ?-hex? ?-words? -seed seed -count count data

       ::otp::otp-md5 ?-hex? ?-words? -seed seed -count count data

       ::otp::otp-sha1 ?-hex? ?-words? -seed seed -count count data

       ::otp::otp-rmd160 ?-hex? ?-words? -seed seed -count count data

       SOON ARAB BURG LIMB FILE WAD
       % otp::otp-md5 -hex -count 99 -seed host67821 "My Secret Pass Phrase"
