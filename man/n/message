NAME
       message - Create and manipulate message widgets

SYNOPSIS
       message pathName ?options?

STANDARD OPTIONS
       -anchor               -background          -borderwidth
       -cursor               -font                -foreground
       -highlightbackground  -highlightcolor      -highlightthickness
       -padx                 -pady                -relief
       -takefocus            -text                -textvariable

       See the options manual entry for details on the standard options.

WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       [-aspect aspect] Specifies a non-negative integer value indicating
       desired aspect ratio for the text.  The aspect ratio is specified as
       100*width/height.  100 means the text should be as wide as it is tall,
       200 means the text should be twice as wide as it is tall, 50 means the
       text should be twice as tall as it is wide, and so on.  Used to choose
       line length for text if width option is not specified.  Defaults to 150.
       [-justify justify] Specifies how to justify lines of text.  Must be one
       of left, center, or right.  Defaults to left.  This option works together
       with the anchor, aspect, padX, padY, and width options to provide a
       variety of arrangements of the text within the window.  The aspect and
       width options determine the amount of screen space needed to display the
       text.  The anchor, padX, and padY options determine where this
       rectangular area is displayed within the widget's window, and the justify
       option determines how each line is displayed within that rectangular
       region.  For example, suppose anchor is e and justify is left, and that
       the message window is much larger than needed for the text.  The text
       will be displayed so that the left edges of all the lines line up and the
       right edge of the longest line is padX from the right side of the window;
       the entire text block will be centered in the vertical span of the
       window.  [-width width] Specifies the length of lines in the window.  The
       value may have any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.  If this
       option has a value greater than zero then the aspect option is ignored
       and the width option determines the line length.  If this option has a
       value less than or equal to zero, then the aspect option determines the
       line length.

DESCRIPTION
       The message command creates a new window (given by the pathName argument)
       and makes it into a message widget.  Additional options, described above,
       may be specified on the command line or in the option database to
       configure aspects of the message such as its colors, font, text, and
       initial relief.  The message command returns its pathName argument.  At
       the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named
       pathName, but pathName's parent must exist.

       A message is a widget that displays a textual string.  A message widget
       has three special features.  First, it breaks up its string into lines in
       order to produce a given aspect ratio for the window.  The line breaks
       are chosen at word boundaries wherever possible (if not even a single
       word would fit on a line, then the word will be split across lines).
       Newline characters in the string will force line breaks;  they can be
       used, for example, to leave blank lines in the display.

       The second feature of a message widget is justification.  The text may be
       displayed left-justified (each line starts at the left side of the
       window), centered on a line-by-line basis, or right-justified (each line
       ends at the right side of the window).

       The third feature of a message widget is that it handles control
       characters and non-printing characters specially.  Tab characters are
       replaced with enough blank space to line up on the next 8-character
       boundary.  Newlines cause line breaks.  Other control characters (ASCII
       code less than 0x20) and characters not defined in the font are displayed
       as a four-character sequence \xhh where hh is the two-digit hexadecimal
       number corresponding to the character.  In the unusual case where the
       font does not contain all of the characters in “0123456789abcdef\x” then
       control characters and undefined characters are not displayed at all.

WIDGET COMMAND
       The message command creates a new Tcl command whose name is pathName.
       This command may be used to invoke various operations on the widget.  It
       has the following general form:
              pathName option ?arg arg ...?
       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following commands are possible for message widgets:

       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the message
              command.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the message command.

DEFAULT BINDINGS
       When a new message is created, it has no default event bindings: messages
       are intended for output purposes only.

BUGS
       Tabs do not work very well with text that is centered or right-justified.
       The most common result is that the line is justified wrong.
