DESCRIPTION
       This package provides the most primitive commands for receiving
       characters to a terminal. They are in essence convenient wrappers around
       the builtin commands read and fileevent.

       ::term::receive::getch ?chan?
              This command reads a single character from the channel with handle
              chan and returns it as the result of the command.

              If not specified chan defaults to stdin.

              It is the responsibility of the caller to make sure that the
              channel can provide single characters. On unix this can be done,
              for example, by using the command of package
              term::ansi::ctrl::unix.

       ::term::receive::listen cmd ?chan?
              This command sets up a filevent listener for the channel with
              handle chan and invokes the command prefix cmd whenever characters
              have been received, or EOF was reached.

              If not specified chan defaults to stdin.

              The signature of the command prefix is

              cmd process string
                     This method is invoked when characters were received, and
                     string holds them for processing.

              cmd eof
                     This method is invoked when EOF was reached on the channel
                     we listen on.  It will be the last call to be received by
                     the callback.

       ::term::receive::unlisten ?chan?
              This command disables the filevent listener for the channel with
              handle chan.

              If not specified chan defaults to stdin.
