DESCRIPTION
       The ::javascript package provides commands that generate HTML and Java
       Script code.  These commands typically return an HTML string as their
       result.  In particular, they do not output their result to stdout.

       ::javascript::makeSelectorWidget id leftLabel leftValueList rightLabel
       rightValueList rightNameList ?length? ?minWidth?
              Construct HTML code to create a dual-multi-selection megawidget.
              This megawidget consists of two side-by-side multi-selection boxes
              separated by a left arrow and a right arrow button.  The right
              arrow button moves all items selected in the left box to the right
              box.  The left arrow button moves all items selected in the right
              box to the left box.  The id argument is the suffix of all HTML
              objects in this megawidget.  The leftLabel argument is the text
              that appears above the left selection box.  The leftValueList
              argument is the values of items in the left selection box.  The
              leftNameList argument is the names to appear in the left selection
              box.  The rightLabel argument is the text that appears above the
              right selection box.  The rightValueList argument is the values of
              items in the right selection box.  The rightNameList argument is
              the names to appear in the right selection box.  The length
              argument (optional) determines the number of elts to show before
              adding a vertical scrollbar; it defaults to 8.  The minWidth
              argument (optional) is the number of spaces to determine the
              minimum box width; it defaults to 32.

       ::javascript::makeSubmitButton name value
              Create an HTML submit button that resets a hidden field for each
              registered multi-selection box.  The name argument is the name of
              the HTML button object to create.  The value argument is the label
              of the HTML button object to create.

       ::javascript::makeProtectedSubmitButton name value msg
              Create an HTML submit button that prompts the user with a
              continue/cancel shutdown warning before the form is submitted.
              The name argument is the name of the HTML button object to create.
              The value argument is the label of the HTML button object to
              create. The msg argument is the message to display when the button
              is pressed.

       ::javascript::makeMasterButton master value slavePattern boolean
              Create an HTML button that sets its slave checkboxs to the boolean
              value.  The master argument is the name of the child's parent html
              checkbox object.  The value argument is the value of the master.
              The slaves argument is the name of child html checkbox object to
              create.  The boolean argument is the java script boolean value
              that will be given to all the slaves; it must be "true" or
              "false".

       ::javascript::makeParentCheckbox parentName childName
              Create an HTML checkbox and tie its value to that of its child
              checkbox.  If the parent is unchecked, the child is automatically
              unchecked.  The parentName argument is the name of parent html
              checkbox object to create. The childName argument is the name of
              the parent's child html checkbox object.

       ::javascript::makeChildCheckbox parentName childName
              Create an HTML checkbox and tie its value to that of its parent
              checkbox.  If the child is checked, the parent is automatically
              checked.  The parentName argument is the name of the child's
              parent html checkbox object.  The childName argument is the name
              of child html checkbox object to create.
