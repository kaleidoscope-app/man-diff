SYNOPSIS
       package require Tcl  8.2

DESCRIPTION
       This package provides two commands to quote and unquote the disallowed
       characters for url using the urn scheme, registers the scheme with the
       package uri, and provides internal helpers which will be automatically
       used by the commands uri::split and uri::join of package uri to handle
       urls using the urn scheme.

COMMANDS
       uri::urn::quote url
              This command quotes the characters disallowed by the urn scheme
              (per RFC 2141 sec2.2) in the url and returns the modified url as
              its result.

       uri::urn::unquote url
              This commands performs the reverse of ::uri::urn::quote. It takes
              an urn url, removes the quoting from all disallowed characters,
              and returns the modified urls as its result.
