NAME
       itk - framework for building mega-widgets in Tcl/Tk
________________________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       Mega-widgets are high-level widgets that are constructed using Tk widgets
       as component parts, usually without any C code.  A fileselectionbox, for
       example, may have a few listboxes, some entry widgets and some control
       buttons.  These individual widgets are put together in a way that makes
       them act like one big widget.  A fileselectionbox mega-widget can be
       created with a command like:
              fileselectionbox .fsb -background blue -foreground white
       Once it has been created, it can be reconfigured with a command like:
              .fsb configure -background green -foreground black
       and all of its internal components will change color.  Each mega-widget
       has a set of methods that can be used to manipulate it.  For example, the
       current selection can be queried from a fileselectionbox like this:
              set fileName [.fsb get]
       In effect, a mega-widget looks and acts exactly like a Tk widget, but is
       considerably easier to implement.

       [incr Tk] is a framework for building mega-widgets.  It uses [incr Tcl]
       to support the object paradigm, and adds base classes which provide
       default widget behaviors.

       All [incr Tk] widgets are derived from the Archetype base class.  This
       class manages internal component widgets, and provides methods like
       "configure" and "cget" to access configuration options.

       The Widget base class inherits everything from Archetype, and adds a Tk
       frame which acts as a container for the mega-widget.  It is used to build
       mega-widgets that sit inside of other frames and toplevels.  Derived
       classes create other internal components and pack them into the "hull"
       frame created by the Widget base class.

       The Toplevel base class inherits everything from Archetype, but adds a Tk
       toplevel which acts as a container for the mega-widget.  It is used to
       build mega-widgets, such as dialog boxes, that have their own toplevel
       window.  Derived classes create other internal components and pack them
       into the "hull" toplevel created by the Toplevel base class.


[incr Widgets] LIBRARY
       [incr Widgets] is a mega-widget library built using [incr Tk].  It can be
       used right out of the box, and contains more than 30 different widget
       classes, including:

       -      fileselectiondialog

       -      tabnotebook

       -      panedwindow

       -      combobox

       -      optionmenu

       -      scrolledlistbox

       -      scrolledframe

       -      messagedialog

       -      and many others...

       The catalog demo in the "iwidgets/demos" directory shows all of the
       available widgets in action.  Each widget class has its own man page
       describing the features available.
