DESCRIPTION
       This package implements a client for the RFC 868 TIME protocol
       (http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc868.txt) and also a minimal client for
       the RFC 2030 Simple Network Time Protocol (http://www.rfc-
       editor.org/rfc/rfc2030.txt).  RFC 868 returns the time in seconds since 1
       January 1900 to either tcp or udp clients. RFC 2030 also gives this time
       but also provides a fractional part which is not used in this client.

COMMANDS
       ::time::gettime ?options? timeserver ?port?
              Get the time from timeserver. You may specify any of the options
              listed for the configure command here. This command returns a
              token which must then be used with the remaining commands in this
              package. Once you have finished, you should use cleanup to release
              all resources. The default port is 37.

       ::time::getsntp ?options? timeserver ?port?
              Get the time from an SNTP server. This accepts exactly the same
              arguments as ::time::gettime except that the default port is 123.
              The result is a token as per ::time::gettime and should be handled
              in the same way.

              Note that it is unlikely that any SNTP server will reply using tcp
              so you will require the tcludp or the ceptcl package. If a
              suitable package can be loaded then the udp protocol will be used
              by default.

       ::time::configure ?options?
              Called with no arguments this command returns all the current
              configuration options and values. Otherwise it should be called
              with pairs of option name and value.

              -protocol number
                     Set the default network protocol. This defaults to udp if
                     the tcludp package is available. Otherwise it will use tcp.

              -port number
                     Set the default port to use. RFC 868 uses port 37, RFC 2030
                     uses port 123.

              -timeout number
                     Set the default timeout value in milliseconds. The default
                     is 10 seconds.

              -command number
                     Set a command procedure to be run when a reply is received.
                     The procedure is called with the time token appended to the
                     argument list.

              -loglevel number
                     Set the logging level. The default is 'warning'.

       ::time::cget name
              Get the current value for the named configuration option.

       ::time::unixtime token
              Format the returned time for the unix epoch. RFC 868 time defines
              time 0 as 1 Jan 1900, while unix time defines time 0 as 1 Jan
              1970. This command converts the reply to unix time.

       ::time::status token
              Returns the status flag. For a successfully completed query this
              will be ok. May be error or timeout or eof.  See also
              ::time::error

       ::time::error token
              Returns the error message provided for requests whose status is
              error.  If there is no error message then an empty string is
              returned.

       ::time::reset token ?reason?
              Reset or cancel the query optionally specfying the reason to
              record for the error command.

       ::time::wait token
              Wait for a query to complete and return the status upon
              completion.

       ::time::cleanup token
              Remove all state variables associated with the request.
