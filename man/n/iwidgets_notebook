WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       Name:           auto
       Class:          Auto
       Command-Line Switch:           -auto

              Specifies whether to use the automatic packing/unpacking algorithm
              of the notebook. A value of true indicates that page frames will
              be unpacked and packed acoording to the algorithm described in the
              select command.  A value of false leaves the current page packed
              and subsequent selects, next, or previous commands do not switch
              pages automatically. In either case the page's associated command
              (see the add command's description of the command option) is
              invoked. The value may have any of the forms accepted by the
              Tcl_GetBoolean, such as true, false, 0, 1, yes, or no.

              For example, if a series of pages in a notebook simply change
              certain display configurations of a graphical display, the -auto
              flag could be used.  By setting it, the -command procs could do
              the appropriate reconfiguring of the page when the page is
              switched.

DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::notebook command creates a new window (given by the
       pathName argument) and makes it into a notebook widget. Additional
       options, described above may be specified on the command line or in the
       option database to configure aspects of the notebook such as its colors,
       font, and text.  The iwidgets::notebook command returns its pathName
       argument. At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a
       window named pathName, but pathName's parent must exist.

       A notebook is a widget that contains a set of pages. It displays one page
       from the set as the selected page. When a page is selected, the page's
       contents are displayed in the page area. When first created a notebook
       has no pages. Pages may be added or deleted using widget commands
       described below.


NOTEBOOK PAGES
       A notebook's pages area contains a single child site frame. When a new
       page is created it is a child of this frame. The page's child site frame
       serves as a geometry container for applications to pack widgets into. It
       is this frame that is automatically unpacked or packed when the auto
       option is true. This creates the effect of one page being visible at a
       time. When a new page is selected, the previously selected page's child
       site frame is automatically unpacked from the notebook's child site frame
       and the newly selected page's child site is packed into the notebook's
       child site frame.

       However, sometimes it is desirable to handle page changes in a different
       manner. By specifying the auto option as false, child site packing can be
       disabled and done differently. For example, all widgets might be packed
       into the first page's child site frame. Then when a new page is selected,
       the application can reconfigure the widgets and give the appearance that
       the page was flipped.

       In both cases the command option for a page specifies a Tcl Command to
       execute when the page is selected. In the case of auto being true, it is
       called between the unpacking of the previously selected page and the
       packing of the newly selected page.


WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       The iwidgets::notebookfR command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
       pathName. This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
       widget. It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.

       Many of the widget commands for a notebook take as one argument an
       indicator of which page of the notebook to operate on. These indicators
       are called indexes and may be specified in any of the following forms:

       number Specifies the index of the the component. For menus, 0 corresponds
              to the left-most menu of the menu bar. For entries, 0 corresponds
              to the top-most entry of the menu.  number Specifies the page
              numerically, where 0 corresponds to the first page in the
              notebook, 1 to the second, and so on.

       select Specifies the currently selected page's index. If no page is
              currently selected, the value -1 is returned.

       end    Specifes the last page in the notebooks's index. If the notebook
              is empty this will return -1.

       pattern
              If the index doesn't satisfy the form of a number, then this form
              is used.  Pattern is pattern-matched against the label of each
              page in the notebook, in order from the first to the last page,
              until a matching entry is found. The rules of Tcl_StringMatch are
              used.

       The following commands are possible for notebook widgets:

       pathName add ?option value?
              Add a new page at the end of the notebook. A new child site frame
              is created. Returns the child site pathName. If additional
              arguments are present, they specify any of the following options:

              -background value
                     Specifies a background color to use for displaying the
                     child site frame of this page. If this option is specified
                     as an empty string (the default), then the background
                     option for the overall notebook is used.

              -command value
                     Specifies a Tcl command to be executed when this page is
                     selected. This allows the programmer a hook to reconfigure
                     this page's widgets or any other page's widgets.

                     If the notebook has the auto option set to true, when a
                     page is selected this command will be called immediately
                     after the previously selected page is unpacked and
                     immediately before this page is selected. The index value
                     select is valid during this Tcl command. `index select'
                     will return this page's page number.

                     If the auto option is set to false, when a page is selected
                     the unpack and pack calls are bypassed. This Tcl command is
                     still called.

              -foreground value
                     Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying tab
                     labels when tabs are in their normal unselected state. If
                     this option is specified as an empty string (the default),
                     then the foreground option for the overall notebook is
                     used.

              -label value
                     Specifies a string to associate with this page. This label
                     serves as an additional identifier used to reference the
                     page. This label may be used for the index value in widget
                     commands.

       pathName childSite ?index?
              If passed no arguments, returns a list of pathNames for all the
              pages in the notebook. If the notebook is empty, an empty list is
              returned

              If index is passed, it returns the pathName for the page's child
              site frame specified by index. Widgets that are created with this
              pathName will be displayed when the associated page is selected.
              If index is not a valid index, an empty string is returned.

       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list). If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified). If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in
              this case the command returns an empty string. Option may have any
              of the values accepted by the iwidgets::notebook command.

       pathName delete index1 ?index2?
              Delete all of the pages between index1 and index2 inclusive.  If
              index2 is omitted then it defaults to index1. Returns an empty
              string.

       pathName index index
              Returns the numerical index corresponding to index.

       pathName insert index ?option value?
              Insert a new page in the notebook before the page specified by
              index.  A new child site frame is created. See the add command for
              valid options. Returns the child site pathName.

       pathName next
              Advances the selected page to the next page (order is determined
              by insertion order). If the currently selected page is the last
              page in the notebook, the selection wraps around to the first page
              in the notebook.

              For notebooks with auto set to true the current page's child site
              is unpacked from the notebook's child site frame. Then the next
              page's child site is packed into the notebooks child site frame.
              The Tcl command given with the command option will be invoked
              between these two operations.

              For notebooks with auto set to false the Tcl command given with
              the command option will be invoked.

       pathName pagecget index ?option?
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option for the page specified by index. The valid available
              options are the same as available to the add command.

       pathName pageconfigure index ?option? ?value option value ...?
              This command is similar to the configure command, except that it
              applies to the options for an individual page, whereas configure
              applies to the options for the notebook. Options may have any of
              the values accepted by the add widget command. If options are
              specified, options are modified as indicated in the command and
              the command returns an empty string. If no options are specified,
              returns a list describing the current options for page index (see
              Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on the format of this list).

       pathName prev
              Moves the selected page to the previous page (order is determined
              by insertion order). If the currently selected page is the first
              page in the notebook, the selection wraps around to the last page
              in the notebook.

              For notebooks with auto set to true the current page's child site
              is unpacked from the notebook's child site frame. Then the
              previous page's child site is packed into the notebooks child site
              frame. The Tcl command given with the command option will be
              invoked between these two operations.

              For notebooks with auto set to false the Tcl command given with
              the command option will be invoked.

       pathName select index
              Selects the page specified by index as the currently selected
              page.

              For notebooks with auto set to true the current page's child site
              is unpacked from the notebook's child site frame. Then the index
              page's child site is packed into the notebooks child site frame.
              The Tcl command given with the command option will be invoked
              between these two operations.

              For notebooks with auto set to false the Tcl command given with
              the command option will be invoked.

       pathName view
              Returns the currently selected page. This command is for
              compatibility with the scrollbar widget.

       pathName view index
              Selects the page specified by index as the currently selected
              page.  This command is for compatibility with the scrollbar
              widget.

       pathName view moveto fraction
              Uses the fraction value to determine the corresponding page to
              move to.  This command is for compatibility with the scrollbar
              widget.

       pathName view scroll num what
              Uses the num value to determine how many pages to move forward or
              backward (num can be negative or positive). The what argument is
              ignored. This command is for compatibility with the scrollbar
              widget.


EXAMPLE
       Following is an example that creates a notebook with two pages. In this
       example, we use a scrollbar widget to control the notebook widget.


              package require Iwidgets 4.0
              # Create the notebook widget and pack it.
                iwidgets::notebook .nb -width 100 -height 100
                pack .nb -anchor nw \
                      -fill both \
                      -expand yes \
                      -side left \
                      -padx 10 \
                      -pady 10

                     # Add two pages to the notebook, labelled
                     # "Page One" and "Page Two", respectively.
                       .nb add -label "Page One"
                       .nb add -label "Page Two"

                     # Get the child site frames of these two pages.
                       set page1CS [.nb childsite 0]
                       set page2CS [.nb childsite "Page Two"]

                     # Create buttons on each page of the notebook
                       button $page1CS.b -text "Button One"
                       pack $page1CS.b
                       button $page2CS.b -text "Button Two"
                       pack $page2CS.b

                     # Select the first page of the notebook
                       .nb select 0

                     # Create the scrollbar and associate teh scrollbar
                     # and the notebook together, then pack the scrollbar
                       scrollbar .scroll -command ".nb view"
                       .nb configure -scrollcommand ".scroll set"
                       pack .scroll -fill y -expand yes -pady 10
