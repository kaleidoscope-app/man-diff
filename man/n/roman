NAME
       math::roman - Tools for creating and manipulating roman numerals

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tcl  8.3

       package require math::roman  ?1.0?

       ::math::roman::toroman i

       ::math::roman::tointeger r

       ::math::roman::sort list

       ::math::roman::expr args

DESCRIPTION
       ::math::roman is a pure-Tcl library for converting between integers and
       roman numerals. It also provides utility functions for sorting and
       performing arithmetic on roman numerals.

       This code was originally harvested from the Tcler's wiki at
       http://wiki.tcl.tk/1823 and as such is free for any use for any purpose.
       Many thanks to the ingeneous folk who devised these clever routines and
       generously contributed them to the Tcl community.

       While written and tested under Tcl 8.3, I expect this library will work
       under all 8.x versions of Tcl.

COMMANDS
       ::math::roman::toroman i
              Convert an integer to roman numerals. The result is always in
              upper case. The value zero is converted to an empty string.

       ::math::roman::tointeger r
              Convert a roman numeral into an integer.

       ::math::roman::sort list
              Sort a list of roman numerals from smallest to largest.

       ::math::roman::expr args
              Evaluate an expression where the operands are all roman numerals.

       Of these commands both toroman and tointeger are exported for easier use.
       The other two are not, as they could interfer or be confused with
       existing Tcl commands.
