DESCRIPTION
       The math::statistics package contains functions and procedures for basic
       statistical data analysis, such as:

       •      Descriptive statistical parameters (mean, minimum, maximum,
              standard deviation)

       •      Estimates of the distribution in the form of histograms and
              quantiles

       •      Basic testing of hypotheses

       •      Probability and cumulative density functions

       It is meant to help in developing data analysis applications or doing ad
       hoc data analysis, it is not in itself a full application, nor is it
       intended to rival with full (non-)commercial statistical packages.

       The purpose of this document is to describe the implemented procedures
       and provide some examples of their usage. As there is ample literature on
       the algorithms involved, we refer to relevant text books for more
       explanations.  The package contains a fairly large number of public
       procedures. They can be distinguished in three sets: general procedures,
       procedures that deal with specific statistical distributions, list
       procedures to select or transform data and simple plotting procedures
       (these require Tk).  Note: The data that need to be analyzed are always
       contained in a simple list. Missing values are represented as empty list
       elements.

GENERAL PROCEDURES
       The general statistical procedures are:

       ::math::statistics::mean data

       ::math::statistics::median data
              Determine the median of the data in the given list (Note that this

              (This routine is called whenever either or all of the basic
              statistical parameters are required. Hence all calculations are
              done and the relevant values are returned.)

              equidistance between samples, about 1/2 of the number of raw data)

              The correlation is determined in such a way that the first value
              is always 1 and all others are equal to or smaller than 1. The
              number of values involved will diminish as the "time" (the index

MULTIVARIATE LINEAR REGRESSION
       Besides the linear regression with a single independent variable, the
       statistics package provides two procedures for doing ordinary least
       squares (OLS) and weighted least squares (WLS) linear regression with
       several variables. They were written by Eric Kemp-Benedict.

       In addition to these two, it provides a procedure (tstat) for calculating
       the value of the t-statistic for the specified number of degrees of
       freedom that is required to demonstrate a given level of significance.

       Note: These procedures depend on the math::linearalgebra package.

       Description of the procedures

       ::math::statistics::tstat dof ?alpha?
              Returns the value of the t-distribution t* satisfying

                  P(t*)  =  1 - alpha/2
                  P(-t*) =  alpha/2

              for the number of degrees of freedom dof.

              Given a sample of normally-distributed data x, with an estimate
              xbar for the mean and sbar for the standard deviation, the alpha
              confidence interval for the estimate of the mean can be calculated
              as

                    ( xbar - t* sbar , xbar + t* sbar)

              The return values from this procedure can be compared to an
              estimated t-statistic to determine whether the estimated value of
              a parameter is significantly different from zero at the given
              confidence level.

              int dof
                     Number of degrees of freedom

              float alpha
                     Confidence level of the t-distribution. Defaults to 0.05.


       ::math::statistics::mv-wls wt1 weights_and_values
              Carries out a weighted least squares linear regression for the
              data points provided, with weights assigned to each point.

              The linear model is of the form

                  y = b0 + b1 * x1 + b2 * x2 ... + bN * xN + error

              and each point satisfies

                  yi = b0 + b1 * xi1 + b2 * xi2 + ... + bN * xiN + Residual_i


              The procedure returns a list with the following elements:

              •      The r-squared statistic

              •      The adjusted r-squared statistic

              •      A list containing the estimated coefficients b1, ... bN, b0
                     (The constant b0 comes last in the list.)

              •      A list containing the standard errors of the coefficients

              •      A list containing the 95% confidence bounds of the
                     coefficients, with each set of bounds returned as a list
                     with two values
       Arguments:

              list weights_and_values
                     A list consisting of: the weight for the first observation,
                     the data for the first observation (as a sublist), the
                     weight for the second observation (as a sublist) and so on.
                     The sublists of data are organised as lists of the value of
                     the dependent variable y and the independent variables x1,
                     x2 to xN.


       ::math::statistics::mv-ols values
              Carries out an ordinary least squares linear regression for the
              data points provided.

              This procedure simply calls ::mvlinreg::wls with the weights set
              to 1.0, and returns the same information.

       Example of the use:

       # Store the value of the unicode value for the "+/-" character
       set pm "\u00B1"

       # Provide some data
       set data {{  -.67  14.18  60.03 -7.5  }
                 { 36.97  15.52  34.24 14.61 }
                 {-29.57  21.85  83.36 -7.   }
                 {-16.9   11.79  51.67 -6.56 }
                 { 14.09  16.24  36.97 -12.84}
                 { 31.52  20.93  45.99 -25.4 }
                 { 24.05  20.69  50.27  17.27}
                 { 22.23  16.91  45.07  -4.3 }
                 { 40.79  20.49  38.92  -.73 }
                 {-10.35  17.24  58.77  18.78}}

       # Call the ols routine
       set results [::math::statistics::mv-ols $data]

       # Pretty-print the results
       puts "R-squared: [lindex $results 0]"
       puts "Adj R-squared: [lindex $results 1]"
       puts "Coefficients $pm s.e. -- \[95% confidence interval\]:"
       foreach val [lindex $results 2] se [lindex $results 3] bounds [lindex $results 4] {
           set lb [lindex $bounds 0]
           set ub [lindex $bounds 1]
           puts "   $val $pm $se -- \[$lb to $ub\]"
       }


STATISTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS
       In the literature a large number of probability distributions can be
       found. The statistics package supports:

       •      The normal or Gaussian distribution

       •      The uniform distribution - equal probability for all data within a
              given interval

       •      The exponential distribution - useful as a model for certain
              extreme-value distributions.

       •      The gamma distribution - based on the incomplete Gamma integral

       •      The chi-square distribution

       •      The student's T distribution

       •      The Poisson distribution

       •      PM - binomial,F.

       In principle for each distribution one has procedures for:

       •      The probability density (pdf-*)

       •      The cumulative density (cdf-*)

       •      Quantiles for the given distribution (quantiles-*)

       •      Histograms for the given distribution (histogram-*)

PLOT PROCEDURES
       The following simple plotting procedures are available:

       ::math::statistics::plot-scale canvas xmin xmax ymin ymax
              Set the scale for a plot in the given canvas. All plot routines
              expect this function to be called first. There is no automatic
              scaling provided.

              widget canvas
                     - Canvas widget to use

              float xmin
                     - Minimum x value

              float xmax
                     - Maximum x value

              float ymin
                     - Minimum y value

              float ymax
                     - Maximum y value


       ::math::statistics::plot-xydata canvas xdata ydata tag
              Create a simple XY plot in the given canvas - the data are shown
              as a collection of dots. The tag can be used to manipulate the
              appearance.

              widget canvas
                     - Canvas widget to use

              float xdata
                     - Series of independent data

              float ydata
                     - Series of dependent data

              string tag
                     - Tag to give to the plotted data (defaults to xyplot)


       ::math::statistics::plot-xyline canvas xdata ydata tag
              Create a simple XY plot in the given canvas - the data are shown
              as a line through the data points. The tag can be used to
              manipulate the appearance.

              widget canvas
                     - Canvas widget to use

              list xdata
                     - Series of independent data

              list ydata
                     - Series of dependent data

              string tag
                     - Tag to give to the plotted data (defaults to xyplot)


       ::math::statistics::plot-tdata canvas tdata tag
              Create a simple XY plot in the given canvas - the data are shown
              as a collection of dots. The horizontal coordinate is equal to the
              index. The tag can be used to manipulate the appearance.  This
              type of presentation is suitable for autocorrelation functions for
              instance or for inspecting the time-dependent behaviour.

              widget canvas
                     - Canvas widget to use

EXAMPLES
       The code below is a small example of how you can examine a set of data:



       # Simple example:
       # - Generate data (as a cheap way of getting some)
       # - Perform statistical analysis to describe the data
       #
       package require math::statistics

       #
       # Two auxiliary procs
       #
       proc pause {time} {
          set wait 0
          after [expr {$time*1000}] {set ::wait 1}
          vwait wait
       }

       proc print-histogram {counts limits} {
          foreach count $counts limit $limits {
             if { $limit != {} } {
                puts [format "<%12.4g\t%d" $limit $count]
                set prev_limit $limit
             } else {
                puts [format ">%12.4g\t%d" $prev_limit $count]
             }
          }
       }

       #
       # Our source of arbitrary data
       #
       proc generateData { data1 data2 } {
          upvar 1 $data1 _data1
          upvar 1 $data2 _data2

          set d1 0.0
          set d2 0.0
          for { set i 0 } { $i < 100 } { incr i } {
             set d1 [expr {10.0-2.0*cos(2.0*3.1415926*$i/24.0)+3.5*rand()}]
             set d2 [expr {0.7*$d2+0.3*$d1+0.7*rand()}]
             lappend _data1 $d1
             lappend _data2 $d2
          }
          return {}
       }

       #
       # The analysis session
       #
       package require Tk
       console show
       canvas .plot1
       canvas .plot2
       pack   .plot1 .plot2 -fill both -side top

       generateData data1 data2

       puts "Basic statistics:"
       set b1 [::math::statistics::basic-stats $data1]
       set b2 [::math::statistics::basic-stats $data2]
       foreach label {mean min max number stdev var} v1 $b1 v2 $b2 {
          puts "$label\t$v1\t$v2"
       }
       puts "Plot the data as function of \"time\" and against each other"

       ::math::statistics::plot-xydata .plot2 $data1 $data2

       puts "Correlation coefficient:"
       puts [::math::statistics::corr $data1 $data2]

       pause 2
       puts "Plot histograms"
       ::math::statistics::plot-scale .plot2  0 20 0 100
       set limits         [::math::statistics::minmax-histogram-limits 7 16]
       set histogram_data [::math::statistics::histogram $limits $data1]
       ::math::statistics::plot-histogram .plot2 $histogram_data $limits

       puts "First series:"
       print-histogram $histogram_data $limits

       pause 2
       set limits         [::math::statistics::minmax-histogram-limits 0 15 10]
       set histogram_data [::math::statistics::histogram $limits $data2]
       ::math::statistics::plot-histogram .plot2 $histogram_data $limits d2

       puts "Second series:"
       print-histogram $histogram_data $limits

       puts "Autocorrelation function:"
       set  autoc [::math::statistics::autocorr $data1]
       puts [::math::statistics::map $autoc {[format "%.2f" $x]}]
       puts "Cross-correlation function:"
       set  crossc [::math::statistics::crosscorr $data1 $data2]
       puts [::math::statistics::map $crossc {[format "%.2f" $x]}]

       ::math::statistics::plot-scale .plot1  0 100 -1  4
       ::math::statistics::plot-tline .plot1  $autoc "autoc"
       ::math::statistics::plot-tline .plot1  $crossc "crossc"

       puts "Quantiles: 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 0.9"
       puts "First:  [::math::statistics::quantiles $data1 {0.1 0.2 0.5 0.8 0.9}]"
       puts "Second: [::math::statistics::quantiles $data2 {0.1 0.2 0.5 0.8 0.9}]"


       If you run this example, then the following should be clear:

       •      There is a strong correlation between two time series, as
              displayed by the raw data and especially by the correlation
              functions.

       •      Both time series show a significant periodic component

       •      The histograms are not very useful in identifying the nature of
              the time series - they do not show the periodic nature.
