DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::scrolledcanvas command creates a scrolled canvas with
       additional options to manage horizontal and vertical scrollbars.  This
       includes options to control which scrollbars are displayed and the
       method, i.e. statically or dynamically.


METHODS
       The iwidgets::scrolledcanvas command creates a new Tcl command whose name
       is pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on
       the widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following commands are possible for scrolledcanvas widgets:

       canvasy         coords         create          dchars
       delete          dtag           find            focus

       raise           scale          scan            select
       type            xview          yview

       See the "canvas" manual entry for details on the associated methods.


WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::scrolledcanvas command.

       pathName childsite
              Returns the child site widget path name.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::scrolledcanvas
              command.

       pathName justify direction
              Justifies the canvas contents via the scroll bars in one of four
              directions: left, right, top, or bottom.
