SYNOPSIS
       tk_dialog window title text bitmap default string string ...
________________________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       This procedure is part of the Tk script library.  Its arguments describe
       a dialog box:

       window Name of top-level window to use for dialog.  Any existing window
              by this name is destroyed.

       title  Text to appear in the window manager's title bar for the dialog.

       text   Message to appear in the top portion of the dialog box.

       bitmap If non-empty, specifies a bitmap to display in the top portion of
              the dialog, to the left of the text.  If this is an empty string
              then no bitmap is displayed in the dialog.

       default
              If this is an integer greater than or equal to zero, then it gives
              the index of the button that is to be the default button for the
              dialog (0 for the leftmost button, and so on).  If less than zero
              or an empty string then there will not be any default button.

       string There will be one button for each of these arguments.  Each string
              specifies text to display in a button, in order from left to
              right.

       After creating a dialog box, tk_dialog waits for the user to select one
       of the buttons either by clicking on the button with the mouse or by
       typing return to invoke the default button (if any).  Then it returns the
       index of the selected button:  0 for the leftmost button, 1 for the
       button next to it, and so on.  If the dialog's window is destroyed before
       the user selects one of the buttons, then -1 is returned.

       While waiting for the user to respond, tk_dialog sets a local grab.  This
       prevents the user from interacting with the application in any way except
       to invoke the dialog box.

EXAMPLE
              set reply [tk_dialog .foo "The Title" "Do you want to say yes?" \
                      questhead 0 Yes No "I'm not sure"]
