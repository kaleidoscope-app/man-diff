DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a general facility for the handling of user events.
       Allows the binding of arbitrary commands to arbitrary events on arbitrary
       tags, removal of bindings, and event generation.

       The main difference to the event system built into the Tcl/Tk core is
       that the latter can generate only virtual events, and only for widgets.
       It is not possible to use the builtin facilities to bind to events on
       arbitrary (pseudo-)objects, nor is it able to generate events for such.

       Here we can, by assuming that each object in question is represented by
       its own tag. Which is possible as we allow arbitrary tags.

       More differences:

       [1]    The package uses only a two-level hierarchy, tags and events, to
              handle everything, whereas the Tcl/Tk system uses three levels,
              i.e.  objects, tags, and events, with a n:m relationship between
              objects and tags.

       [2]    This package triggers all bound commands for a tag/event
              combination, and they are independent of each other. A bound
              command cannot force the event processing core to abort the
              processing of command coming after it.

API
       The package exports three commands, as specified below:

       ::uevent::bind tag event command
              Using this command registers the command prefix to be triggered
              when the event occurs for the tag. The result of the command is an
              opaque token representing the binding. Note that if the same
              combination of <tag,event,command> is used multiple times the same
              token is returned by every call.

              The signature of the command prefix is

              command tag event details

       where details contains the argument(s) of the event. Its contents are
       event specific and have to be agreed upon between actual event generator
       and consumer. This package simply transfers the information and does not
       perform any processing beyond that.

       ::uevent::unbind token
              This command releases the event binding represented by the token.
              The token has to be the result of a call to ::uevent::bind. The
              result of the command is the empty string.

       ::uevent::generate tag event ?details?
              This command generates an event for the tag, triggering all
              commands bound to that combination. The details argument is simply
              passed unchanged to all event handlers. It is the responsibility
              of the code generating and consuming the event to have an
              agreement about the format and contents of the information carried
              therein. The result of the command is the empty string.

              Note that all bound commands are triggered, independently of each
              other. The event handlers cannot assume a specific order. They are
              also not called synchronously with the invokation of this command,
              but simply put into the event queue for processing when the system
              returns to the event loop.

              Generating an event for an unknown tag, or for a <tag,event>
              combination which has no commands bound to it is allowed, such
              calls will be ignored.

       ::uevent::list
              In this form the command returns a list containing the names of
              all tags which have events with commands bound to them.

       ::uevent::list tag
              In this format the command returns a list containing the names of
              all events for the tag with commands bound to them. Specifying an
              unknown tag, i.e. a tag without event and commands, will cause the
              command to throw an error.

       ::uevent::list tag event
              In this format the command returns a list containing all commands
              bound to the event for the tag. Specifying an unknown tag or
              unknown event, will cause the command to throw an error.
