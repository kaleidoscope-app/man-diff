NAME
       memchan - C API for creating memory channels

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tcl

       package require memchan

       Tcl_Channel Memchan_CreateMemoryChannel (Tcl_Interp *interp, int
       initialSize)

       Tcl_Channel Memchan_CreateFifoChannel (Tcl_Interp *interp)

       void Memchan_CreateFifo2Channel (Tcl_Interp *interp, Tcl_Channel *aPtr,
       Tcl_Channel *bPtr)

       Tcl_Channel Memchan_CreateNullChannel (Tcl_Interp *interp)

       Tcl_Channel Memchan_CreateZeroChannel (Tcl_Interp *interp)

       Tcl_Channel Memchan_CreateRandomChannel (Tcl_Interp *interp)

DESCRIPTION
       The memchan package provides a C API for use by third-party extension
       writers. This is exposed by a Tcl stubs library table to reduce version
       dependency as is available for Tcl itself.

COMMAND
       Tcl_Channel Memchan_CreateMemoryChannel (Tcl_Interp *interp, int
       initialSize)

       Tcl_Channel Memchan_CreateFifoChannel (Tcl_Interp *interp)

       void Memchan_CreateFifo2Channel (Tcl_Interp *interp, Tcl_Channel *aPtr,
       Tcl_Channel *bPtr)

       Tcl_Channel Memchan_CreateNullChannel (Tcl_Interp *interp)

       Tcl_Channel Memchan_CreateZeroChannel (Tcl_Interp *interp)

       Tcl_Channel Memchan_CreateRandomChannel (Tcl_Interp *interp)

       Each of these functions creates an returns a channel exactly as described
       in the Tcl command pages for each of the memchan commands. The Tcl
       commands internally call these functions to create the channels.

       The memchan channel accepts an initialSize argument to permit pre-
       allocating space for the internal buffer. Normally this may be set to 0.

       The fifo2 API function looks a little different because it must return
       two linked channels.
