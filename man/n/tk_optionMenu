________________________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       This procedure creates an option menubutton whose name is pathName, plus
       an associated menu.  Together they allow the user to select one of the
       values given by the value arguments.  The current value will be stored in
       the global variable whose name is given by varName and it will also be
       displayed as the label in the option menubutton.  The user can click on
       the menubutton to display a menu containing all of the values and thereby
       select a new value.  Once a new value is selected, it will be stored in
       the variable and appear in the option menubutton.  The current value can
       also be changed by setting the variable.

       The return value from tk_optionMenu is the name of the menu associated
       with pathName, so that the caller can change its configuration options or
       manipulate it in other ways.
