DESCRIPTION
       This is an implementation in Tcl of the Preparation of Internationalized
       Strings ("stringprep"). It allows to define stringprep profiles and use
       them to prepare Unicode strings for comparison as defined in RFC-3454.

COMMANDS
       ::stringprep::register profile ?-mapping list? ?-normalization form?
       ?-prohibited list? ?-prohibitedList list? ?-prohibitedCommand command?
       ?-prohibitedBidi boolean?
              Register the stringprep profile named profile. Options are the
              following.

              Option -mapping specifies stringprep mapping tables.  This
              parameter takes list of tables from appendix B of RFC-3454. The
              usual list values are {B.1 B.2} or {B.1 B.3} where B.1 contains
              characters which commonly map to nothing, B.3 specifies case
              folding, and B.2 is used in profiles with unicode normalization
              form KC. Defult value is {} which means no mapping.

              Option -normalization takes a string and if it is nonempty then it
              uses as a name of Unicode normalization form. Any value of "D",
              "C", "KD" or "KC" may be used, though RFC-3454 defines only two
              options: no normalization or normalization using form KC.

              Option -prohibited takes a list of RFC-3454 tables with prohibited
              characters. Current version does allow to prohibit either all
              tables from C.3 to C.9 or neither of them. An example of this list
              for RFC-3491 is {A.1 C.1.2 C.2.2 C.3 C.4 C.5 C.6 C.7 C.8 C.9}.

              Option -prohibitedList specifies a list of additional prohibited
              characters. The list contains not characters themselves but their
              Unicode numbers. For example, Nodeprep specification from RFC-3920
              forbids the following codes: {0x22 0x26 0x27 0x2f 0x3a 0x3c 0x3e
              0x40} (\" \& \' / : < > @).

              Option -prohibitedCommand specifies a command which is called for
              every character code in mapped and normalized string. If the
              command returns true then the character is considered prohibited.
              This option is useful when a list for -prohibitedList is too
              large.

              Option -prohibitedBidi takes boolean value and if it is true then
              the bidirectional character processing rules defined in section 6
              of RFC-3454 are used.

       ::stringprep::stringprep profile string
              Performs stringprep operations defined in profile profile to
              string string. Result is a prepared string or one of the following
              errors: invalid_profile (profile profile is not defined),
              prohibited_character (string string contains a prohibited
              character) or prohibited_bidi (string string contains a prohibited
              bidirectional sequence).

       ::stringprep::compare profile string1 string2
              Compares two unicode strings prepared accordingly to stringprep
              profile profile. The command returns 0 if prepared strings are
              equal, -1 if string1 is lexicographically less than string2, or 1
              if string1 is lexicographically greater than string2.

EXAMPLES
       Nameprep profile definition (see RFC-3491):

       ::stringprep::register nameprep  -mapping {B.1 B.2}  -normalization KC  -prohibited {A.1 C.1.2 C.2.2 C.3 C.4 C.5 C.6 C.7 C.8 C.9}  -prohibitedBidi 1

       Nodeprep and resourceprep profile definitions (see RFC-3920):

       ::stringprep::register nodeprep  -mapping {B.1 B.2}  -normalization KC  -prohibited {A.1 C.1.1 C.1.2 C.2.1 C.2.2 C.3 C.4 C.5 C.6 C.7 C.8 C.9}  -prohibitedList {0x22 0x26 0x27 0x2f 0x3a 0x3c 0x3e 0x40}  -prohibitedBidi 1

       ::stringprep::register resourceprep  -mapping {B.1}  -normalization KC  -prohibited {A.1 C.1.2 C.2.1 C.2.2 C.3 C.4 C.5 C.6 C.7 C.8 C.9}  -prohibitedBidi 1
