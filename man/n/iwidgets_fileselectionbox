DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::fileselectionbox command creates a file selection box
       similar to the OSF/Motif standard Xmfileselectionbox composite widget.
       The fileselectionbox is composed of directory and file scrolled lists as
       well as filter and selection entry fields.  Bindings are in place such
       that selection of a directory list item loads the filter entry field and
       selection of a file list item loads the selection entry field.  Options
       exist to control the appearance and actions of the widget.


METHODS
       The iwidgets::fileselectionbox command creates a new Tcl command whose
       name is pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations
       on the widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following commands are possible for fileselectionbox widgets:


WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::fileselectionbox command.

       pathName childsite
              Returns the child site widget path name.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::fileselectionbox
              command.

       pathName filter
              Update the current contents of the file selection box based on the
              current filter entry field value.

       pathName get
              Returns the current value of the selection entry widget.
