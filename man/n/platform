NAME
       platform - System identification support code and utilities

SYNOPSIS
       package require platform ?1.0.4?

       platform::generic
       platform::identify
       platform::patterns identifier

DESCRIPTION
       The platform package provides several utility commands useful for the
       identification of the architecture of a machine running Tcl.

       Whilst Tcl provides the tcl_platform array for identifying the current
       architecture (in particular, the platform and machine elements) this is
       not always sufficient. This is because (on Unix machines) tcl_platform
       reflects the values returned by the uname command and these are not
       standardized across platforms and architectures. In addition, on at least
       one platform (AIX) the tcl_platform(machine) contains the CPU serial
       number.

       Consequently, individual applications need to manipulate the values in
       tcl_platform (along with the output of system specific utilities) - which
       is both inconvenient for developers, and introduces the potential for
       inconsistencies in identifying architectures and in naming conventions.

       The platform package prevents such fragmentation - i.e., it establishes a
       standard naming convention for architectures running Tcl and makes it
       more convenient for developers to identify the current architecture a Tcl
       program is running on.

COMMANDS
       platform::identify
              This command returns an identifier describing the platform the Tcl
              core is running on. The returned identifier has the general format
              OS-CPU. The OS part of the identifier may contain details like
              kernel version, libc version, etc., and this information may
              contain dashes as well.  The CPU part will not contain dashes,
              making the preceding dash the last dash in the result.

       platform::generic
              This command returns a simplified identifier describing the
              platform the Tcl core is running on. In contrast to
              platform::identify it leaves out details like kernel version, libc
              version, etc. The returned identifier has the general format
              OS-CPU.

       platform::patterns  identifier
              This command takes an identifier as returned by platform::identify
              and returns a list of identifiers describing compatible
              architectures.

KEYWORDS
       operating system, cpu architecture, platform, architecture
