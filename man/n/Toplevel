NAME
       toplevel - Create and manipulate toplevel widgets

SYNOPSIS
       toplevel pathName ?options?

STANDARD OPTIONS
       -borderwidth          -highlightcolor      -pady
       -cursor               -highlightthickness  -relief
       -highlightbackground  -padx                -takefocus

       See the options manual entry for details on the standard options.

WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       [-background background] This option is the same as the standard
       background option except that its value may also be specified as an empty
       string.  In this case, the widget will display no background or border,
       and no colors will be consumed from its colormap for its background and
       border.  [-class class] Specifies a class for the window.  This class
       will be used when querying the option database for the window's other
       options, and it will also be used later for other purposes such as
       bindings.  The class option may not be changed with the configure widget
       command.  [-colormap colormap] Specifies a colormap to use for the
       window.  The value may be either new, in which case a new colormap is
       created for the window and its children, or the name of another window
       (which must be on the same screen and have the same visual as pathName),
       in which case the new window will use the colormap from the specified
       window.  If the colormap option is not specified, the new window uses the
       default colormap of its screen.  This option may not be changed with the
       configure widget command.  [-container container] The value must be a
       boolean.  If true, it means that this window will be used as a container
       in which some other application will be embedded (for example, a Tk
       toplevel can be embedded using the -use option).  The window will support
       the appropriate window manager protocols for things like geometry
       requests.  The window should not have any children of its own in this
       application.  This option may not be changed with the configure widget
       command.  [-height height] Specifies the desired height for the window in
       any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.  If this option is less than
       or equal to zero then the window will not request any size at all.
       [-menu menu] Specifies a menu widget to be used as a menubar. On the
       Macintosh, the menubar will be displayed across the top of the main
       monitor. On Microsoft Windows and all UNIX platforms, the menu will
       appear across the toplevel window as part of the window dressing
       maintained by the window manager.  [-screen ] Specifies the screen on
       which to place the new window.  Any valid screen name may be used, even
       one associated with a different display.  Defaults to the same screen as
       its parent.  This option is special in that it may not be specified via
       the option database, and it may not be modified with the configure widget
       command.  [-use use] This option is used for embedding. If the value is
       not an empty string, it must be the window identifier of a container
       window, specified as a hexadecimal string like the ones returned by the
       winfo id command. The toplevel widget will be created as a child of the
       given container instead of the root window for the screen.  If the
       container window is in a Tk application, it must be a frame or toplevel
       widget for which the -container option was specified.  This option may
       not be changed with the configure widget command.  [-visual visual]
       Specifies visual information for the new window in any of the forms
       accepted by Tk_GetVisual.  If this option is not specified, the new
       window will use the default visual for its screen.  The visual option may
       not be modified with the configure widget command.  [-width width]
       Specifies the desired width for the window in any of the forms acceptable
       to Tk_GetPixels.  If this option is less than or equal to zero then the
       window will not request any size at all.

DESCRIPTION
       The toplevel command creates a new toplevel widget (given by the pathName
       argument).  Additional options, described above, may be specified on the
       command line or in the option database to configure aspects of the
       toplevel such as its background color and relief.  The toplevel command
       returns the path name of the new window.

       A toplevel is similar to a frame except that it is created as a top-level
       window:  its X parent is the root window of a screen rather than the
       logical parent from its path name.  The primary purpose of a toplevel is
       to serve as a container for dialog boxes and other collections of
       widgets.  The only visible features of a toplevel are its background
       color and an optional 3-D border to make the toplevel appear raised or
       sunken.


WIDGET COMMAND
       The toplevel command creates a new Tcl command whose name is the same as
       the path name of the toplevel's window.  This command may be used to
       invoke various operations on the widget.  It has the following general
       form:
              pathName option ?arg arg ...?
       PathName is the name of the command, which is the same as the toplevel
       widget's path name.  Option and the args determine the exact behavior of
       the command.  The following commands are possible for toplevel widgets:

       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              toplevel command.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the toplevel command.


BINDINGS
       When a new toplevel is created, it has no default event bindings:
       toplevels are not intended to be interactive.
