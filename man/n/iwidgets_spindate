DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::spindate command creates a set of spinners for use in date
       value entry.  The set includes an month, day, and year spinner widget.


METHODS
       The iwidgets::spindate command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
       pathName. This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
       widget. It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command. The
       following commands are possible for spindate widgets:


WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::spindate command.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::spindate command.

       pathName get ?format?
              Returns the current contents of the spindate widget in a format of
              string or as an integer clock value using the -string and -clicks
              format options respectively.  The default is by string.  Reference
              the clock command for more information on obtaining dates and
              their formats.

       pathName show date
              Changes the currently displayed date to be that of the date
              argument.  The date may be specified either as a string, an
              integer clock value or the keyword "now".  Reference the clock
              command for more information on obtaining dates and their formats.
