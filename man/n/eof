NAME
       eof - Check for end of file condition on channel

SYNOPSIS
       eof channelId
________________________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       Returns 1 if an end of file condition occurred during the most recent
       input operation on channelId (such as gets), 0 otherwise.

       ChannelId must be an identifier for an open channel such as a Tcl
       standard channel (stdin, stdout, or stderr), the return value from an
       invocation of open or socket, or the result of a channel creation command
       provided by a Tcl extension.

EXAMPLES
       Read and print out the contents of a file line-by-line:
              set f [open somefile.txt]
              while {1} {
                  set line [gets $f]
                  if {[eof $f]} {
                      close $f
                      break
                  }
                  puts "Read line: $line"
              }

       Read and print out the contents of a file by fixed-size records:
              set f [open somefile.dat]
              fconfigure $f -translation binary
              set recordSize 40
              while {1} {
                  set record [read $f $recordSize]
                  if {[eof $f]} {
                      close $f
                      break
                  }
                  puts "Read record: $record"
              }
