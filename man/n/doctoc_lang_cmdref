DESCRIPTION
       This document specifies both names and syntax of all the commands which
       together are the doctoc markup language, version 1.  As this document is
       intended to be a reference the commands are listed in alphabetical order,
       and the descriptions are relatively short.  A beginner should read the
       much more informally written doctoc language introduction first.

COMMANDS
       comment plaintext
              Toc markup. The argument text is marked up as a comment standing
              outside of the actual text of the document. Main use is in free-
              form text.

       division_end
              Toc structure. This command closes the division opened by the last
              division_begin command coming before it, and not yet closed.

       division_start text ?symfile?
              Toc structure. This command opens a division in the table of
              contents. Its counterpart is division_end. Together they allow a
              user to give a table of contents additional structure.

              The title of the new division is provided by the argument text.

              If the symbolic filename symfile is present then the section title
              should link to the referenced document, if links are supported by
              the output format.

       include filename
              Templating. The contents of the named file are interpreted as text
              written in the doctoc markup and processed in the place of the
              include command. The markup in the file has to be self-contained.
              It is not possible for a markup command to cross the file
              boundaries.

       item file text desc
              Toc structure. This command adds an individual element to the
              table of contents. Each such element refers to a document. The
              document is specified through the symbolic name file. The text
              argument is used to label the reference, whereas the desc provides
              a short descriptive text of that document.

              The symbolic names are used to preserve the convertibility of this
              format to any output format. The actual name of the file will be
              inserted by the chosen formatting engine when converting the
              input. This will be based on a mapping from symbolic to actual
              names given to the engine.

       lb     Text. The command is replaced with a left bracket. Use in free-
              form text. Required to avoid interpretation of a left bracket as
              the start of a markup command. Its usage is restricted to the
              arguments of other markup commands.

       rb     Text. The command is replaced with a right bracket. Use in free-
              form text. Required to avoid interpretation of a right bracket as
              the end of a markup command. Its usage is restricted to the
              arguments of other commands.

       toc_begin text title
              Document structure. The command to start a table of contents. The
              arguments are a label for the whole group of documents the index
              refers to (text) and the overall title text for the index (title),
              without markup.

              The label often is the name of the package (or extension) the
              documents belong to.

       toc_end
              Document structure. Command to end a table of contents. Anything
              in the document coming after this command is in error.

       vset varname value
              Templating. In this form the command sets the named document
              variable to the specified value. It does not generate output. I.e.
              the command is replaced by the empty string.

       vset varname
              Templating. In this form the command is replaced by the value of
              the named document variable
