DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a Tcl-only implementation of the CRC algorithms
       based upon information provided at
       http://www.microconsultants.com/tips/crc/crc.txt There are a number of
       permutations available for calculating CRC checksums and this package can
       handle all of them. Defaults are set up for the most common cases.

COMMANDS
       ::crc::crc16 ?-format format? ?-seed value? ?-implementation procname?
       message

       ::crc::crc16 ?-format format? ?-seed value? ?-implementation procname?
       -filename file

       ::crc::crc-ccitt ?-format format? ?-seed value? ?-implementation
       procname? message

       ::crc::crc-ccitt ?-format format? ?-seed value? ?-implementation
       procname? -filename file

       ::crc::xmodem ?-format format? ?-seed value? ?-implementation procname?
       message

       ::crc::xmodem ?-format format? ?-seed value? ?-implementation procname?
       -filename file
              The command takes either string data or a file name and returns a
              checksum value calculated using the CRC algorithm. The command
              used sets up the CRC polynomial, initial value and bit ordering
              for the desired standard checksum calculation. The result is
              formatted using the format(n) specifier provided or as an unsigned
              integer (%u) by default.

              A number of common polynomials are in use with the CRC algorithm
              and the most commonly used of these are included in this package.
              For convenience each of these has a command alias in the crc
              namespace.

              It is possible to implement the CRC-32 checksum using this crc16
              package as the implementation is sufficiently generic to extend to
              32 bit checksums. As an example this has been done already -
              however this is not the fastest method to implement this algorithm
              in Tcl and a separate crc32 package is available.

OPTIONS
       -filename name
              Return a checksum for the file contents instead of for parameter
              data.

       -format string
              Return the checksum using an alternative format template.

       -seed value
              Select an alternative seed value for the CRC calculation. The
              default is 0 for the CRC16 calculation and 0xFFFF for the CCITT
              version.  This can be useful for calculating the CRC for data
              structures without first converting the whole structure into a
              string. The CRC of the previous member can be used as the seed for
              calculating the CRC of the next member. It is also used for
              accumulating a checksum from fragments of a large message (or
              file)

       -implementation procname
              This hook is provided to allow users to provide their own
              implementation (perhaps a C compiled extension). The procedure
              specfied is called with two parameters. The first is the data to
              be checksummed and the second is the seed value. An integer is
              expected as the result.

              The package provides some implementations of standard CRC
              polynomials for the XMODEM, CCITT and the usual CRC-16 checksum.
              For convenience, additional commands have been provided that make
              use of these implementations.
