WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       Name:   topics
       Class:  Topics
       Command-Line Switch:    -topics

              Specifies a list of help topics in the form {?topic? ... }. Topic
              may either be a topic name, in which case the document associated
              with the topic should be in the file helpdir/topic.html, or it may
              be of the form {name file}. In the latter case, name is displayed
              in the topic menu, and selecting the name loads file. If file has
              a relative path, it is assumed to be relative to helpdir.

       Name:   helpdir
       Class:  Directory
       Command-Line Switch:    -helpdir

              Specifies the directory where help files are located.

       Command-Line Switch:    -closecmd

              Specifies the tcl command to be executed when the close option is
              selected from the topics menu.

       Name:   maxHistory
       Class:  MaxHistory
       Command-Line Switch:    -maxhistory

              Specifies the maximum number of entries stored in the history list

       Name:   beforelink
       Class:  BeforeLink

              Specifies a command to be eval'ed before a new link is displayed.
              The path of the link to be displayed is appended before evaling
              the command. A suggested use might be to busy the widget while a
              new page is being displayed.

       Name:   afterlink
       Class:  AfterLink
       Command-Line Switch:    -afterlink

              Specifies a command to be eval'ed after a new link is completely
              displayed.  The path of the link that was displayed is appended
              before evaling the command.

DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::hyperhelp command creates a shell window with a pulldown
       menu showing a list of topics. The topics are displayed by importing a
       HTML formatted file named helpdir/topic.html. For a list of supported
       HTML tags, see scrolledhtml(n).


METHODS
       The iwidgets::hyperhelp command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
       pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
       widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following commands are possible for dialog widgets:

INHERITED METHODS
       activate        center         childsite       deactivate

       See the "shell" manual entry for details on the above inherited methods.


WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::hyperhelp command.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::hyperhelp command.

       pathName showtopic topic
              Display html file helpdir/topic.html. Topic may optionally be of
              the form topicname#anchorname. In this form, either topicname or
              anchorname or both may be empty. If topicname is empty, the
              current topic is assumed. If anchorname is empty, the top of the
              document is assumed

       pathName followlink href
              Display html file href. Href may be optionally be of the form
              filename#anchorname. In this form, either filename or anchorname
              or both may be empty. If filename is empty, the current document
              is assumed. If anchorname is empty, the top of the document is
              assumed.

       pathName forward
              Display html file one forward in history list, if applicable.

       pathName back
              Display html file one back in history list, if applicable.
