NAME
       concat - Join lists together

SYNOPSIS
       concat ?arg arg ...?
________________________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       This command joins each of its arguments together with spaces after
       trimming leading and trailing white-space from each of them.  If all the
       arguments are lists, this has the same effect as concatenating them into
       a single list.  It permits any number of arguments; if no args are
       supplied, the result is an empty string.

EXAMPLES
       Although concat will concatenate lists, flattening them in the process
       (so giving the following interactive session):

              % concat a b {c d e} {f {g h}}
              a b c d e f {g h}

       it will also concatenate things that are not lists, as can be seen from
       this session:

              % concat " a b {c   " d "  e} f"
              a b {c d e} f

       Note also that the concatenation does not remove spaces from the middle
       of values, as can be seen here:

              % concat "a   b   c" { d e f }
              a   b   c d e f

       (i.e., there are three spaces between each of the a, the b and the c).
