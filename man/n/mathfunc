DESCRIPTION
       The expr command handles mathematical functions of the form sin($x) or
       atan2($y,$x) by converting them to calls of the form [tcl::mathfunc::sin
       [expr {$x}]] or [tcl::mathfunc::atan2 [expr {$y}] [expr {$x}]].  A number
       of math functions are available by default within the namespace
       ::tcl::mathfunc; these functions are also available for code apart from
       expr, by invoking the given commands directly.

       Tcl supports the following mathematical functions in expressions, all of
       which work solely with floating-point numbers unless otherwise noted:

              abs         acos        asin       atan
              atan2       bool        ceil       cos
              cosh        double      entier     exp
              floor       fmod        hypot      int
              isqrt       log         log10      max
              min         pow         rand       round
              sin         sinh        sqrt       srand
              tan         tanh        wide


       In addition to these predefined functions, applications may define
       additional functions by using proc (or any other method, such as interp
       alias or Tcl_CreateObjCommand) to define new commands in the
       tcl::mathfunc namespace.  In addition, an obsolete interface named
       Tcl_CreateMathFunc() is available to extensions that are written in C.
       The latter interface is not recommended for new implementations.

   DETAILED DEFINITIONS
       abs arg
              Returns the absolute value of arg.  Arg may be either integer or
              floating-point, and the result is returned in the same form.

       acos arg
              Returns the arc cosine of arg, in the range [0,pi] radians. Arg
              should be in the range [-1,1].

       asin arg
              Returns the arc sine of arg, in the range [-pi/2,pi/2] radians.
              Arg should be in the range [-1,1].

       atan arg
              Returns the arc tangent of arg, in the range [-pi/2,pi/2] radians.

       atan2 y x
              Returns the arc tangent of y/x, in the range [-pi,pi] radians.  x
              and y cannot both be 0.  If x is greater than 0, this is
              equivalent to “atan [expr {y/x}]”.

       bool arg
              Accepts any numeric value, or any string acceptable to string is
              boolean, and returns the corresponding boolean value 0 or 1.  Non-
              zero numbers are true.  Other numbers are false.  Non-numeric
              strings produce boolean value in agreement with string is true and
              string is false.

       ceil arg
              Returns the smallest integral floating-point value (i.e. with a
              zero fractional part) not less than arg.  The argument may be any
              numeric value.

       cos arg
              Returns the cosine of arg, measured in radians.

       cosh arg
              Returns the hyperbolic cosine of arg.  If the result would cause
              an overflow, an error is returned.

       double arg
              The argument may be any numeric value, If arg is a floating-point
              value, returns arg, otherwise converts arg to floating-point and
              returns the converted value.  May return Inf or -Inf when the
              argument is a numeric value that exceeds the floating-point range.

       entier arg
              The argument may be any numeric value.  The integer part of arg is │
              determined and returned.  The integer range returned by this       │
              function is unlimited, unlike int and wide which truncate their    │
              range to fit in particular storage widths.

       exp arg
              Returns the exponential of arg, defined as e**arg.  If the result
              would cause an overflow, an error is returned.

       floor arg
              Returns the largest integral floating-point value (i.e. with a
              zero fractional part) not greater than arg.  The argument may be
              any numeric value.

       fmod x y
              Returns the floating-point remainder of the division of x by y.
              If y is 0, an error is returned.

       hypot x y
              Computes the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle
              “sqrt [expr {x*x+y*y}]”.

       int arg
              The argument may be any numeric value.  The integer part of arg is
              determined, and then the low order bits of that integer value up
              to the machine word size are returned as an integer value.  For
              reference, the number of bytes in the machine word are stored in
              tcl_platform(wordSize).

       isqrt arg
              Computes the integer part of the square root of arg.  Arg must be
              a positive value, either an integer or a floating point number.
              Unlike sqrt, which is limited to the precision of a floating point
              number, isqrt will return a result of arbitrary precision.

       log arg
              Returns the natural logarithm of arg.  Arg must be a positive
              value.

       log10 arg
              Returns the base 10 logarithm of arg.  Arg must be a positive
              value.

       max arg ...
              Accepts one or more numeric arguments.  Returns the one argument
              with the greatest value.

       min arg ...
              Accepts one or more numeric arguments.  Returns the one argument
              with the least value.

       pow x y
              Computes the value of x raised to the power y.  If x is negative,
              y must be an integer value.

       rand   Returns a pseudo-random floating-point value in the range (0,1).
              The generator algorithm is a simple linear congruential generator
              that is not cryptographically secure.  Each result from rand
              completely determines all future results from subsequent calls to
              rand, so rand should not be used to generate a sequence of
              secrets, such as one-time passwords.  The seed of the generator is
              initialized from the internal clock of the machine or may be set
              with the srand function.

       round arg
              If arg is an integer value, returns arg, otherwise converts arg to
              integer by rounding and returns the converted value.

       sin arg
              Returns the sine of arg, measured in radians.

       sinh arg
              Returns the hyperbolic sine of arg.  If the result would cause an
              overflow, an error is returned.

       sqrt arg
              The argument may be any non-negative numeric value.  Returns a
              floating-point value that is the square root of arg.  May return
              Inf when the argument is a numeric value that exceeds the square
              of the maximum value of the floating-point range.

       srand arg
              The arg, which must be an integer, is used to reset the seed for
              the random number generator of rand.  Returns the first random
              number (see rand) from that seed.  Each interpreter has its own
              seed.

       tan arg
              Returns the tangent of arg, measured in radians.

       tanh arg
              Returns the hyperbolic tangent of arg.

       wide arg
              The argument may be any numeric value.  The integer part of arg is
              determined, and then the low order 64 bits of that integer value
              are returned as an integer value.
