DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::radiobox command creates a radio button box widget capable
       of adding, inserting, deleting, selecting, and configuring radiobuttons
       as well as obtaining the currently selected button.


METHODS
       The iwidgets::radiobox command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
       pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
       widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.

       Many of the widget commands for the radiobox take as one argument an
       indicator of which radiobutton of the radiobox to operate on.  These
       indicators are called indexes and allow reference and manipulation of
       radiobuttons.  Radiobox indexes may be specified in any of the following
       forms:

       number      Specifies the radiobutton numerically, where 0 corresponds to
                   the top radiobutton of the radiobox.

       end         Indicates the last radiobutton of the radiobox.

       pattern     If the index doesn't satisfy one of the above forms then this
                   form is used.  Pattern is pattern-matched against the tag of
                   each radiobutton in the radiobox, in order from top to
                   bottom, until a matching entry is found.  The rules of
                   Tcl_StringMatch are used.


WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName add tag ?option value option value?
              Adds a new radiobutton to the radiobuttond window on the bottom.
              The command takes additional options which are passed on to the
              radiobutton as construction arguments.  These include the standard
              Tk radiobutton options.  The tag is returned.

       pathName buttonconfigure index ?options?
              This command is similar to the configure command, except that it
              applies to the options for an individual radiobutton, whereas
              configureapplies to the options for the radiobox as a whole.
              Options may have any of the values accepted by the add widget
              command.  If options are specified, options are modified as
              indicated in the command and the command returns an empty string.
              If no options are specified, returns a list describing the current
              options for entry index (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on
              the format of this list).

       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::radiobox command.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::radiobox command.

       pathName delete index
              Deletes a specified radiobutton given an index.

       pathName deselect index
              Deselects a specified radiobutton given an index.

       pathName flash index
              Flashes a specified radiobutton given an index.

       pathName get
              Returns the tag of the currently selected radiobutton.

       pathName index index
              Returns the numerical index corresponding to index.

       pathName insert index tag ?option value option value ...?
              Same as the add command except that it inserts the new radiobutton
              just before the one given by index, instead of appending to the
              end of the radiobox.  The option, and value arguments have the
              same interpretation as for the add widget command.

       pathName select index
              Selects a specified radiobutton given an index.
