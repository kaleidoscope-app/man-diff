DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::calendar command creates a calendar widget for the
       selection of a date, displaying a single month at a time.  Buttons exist
       on the top to change the month in effect turning the pages of a calendar.
       As a page is turned, the dates for the month are modified.  Selection of
       a date visually marks that date.  The selected value can be monitored via
       the -command option or just retrieved using the get command.


METHODS
       The iwidgets::calendar command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
       pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
       widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following commands are possible for calendar widgets:


WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::calendar command.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::calendar command.

       pathName get ?format?
              Returns the currently selected date in a format of string or as an
              integer clock value using the -string and -clicks format options
              respectively.  The default is by string.  Reference the clock
              command for more information on obtaining dates and their formats.

       pathName select date
              Changes the currently selected date to the value specified which
              must be in the form of a date string, an integer clock value or as
              the keyword "now".  Reference the clock command for more
              information on obtaining dates and their formats.  Note that
              selecting a date does not change the month being shown to that of
              the date given.  This chore is left to the show command.

       pathName show date
              Changes the currently displayed date to be that of the date
              argument which must be in the form of a date string, an integer
              clock value or as the keyword "now".  Reference the clock command
              for more information on obtaining dates and their formats.
