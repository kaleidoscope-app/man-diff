NAME
       otp_words - Encoding "otp_words"

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tcl  ?8.2?

       package require Trf  ?2.1.4?

       otp_words ?options...? ?data?

________________________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       The command otp_words is one of several data encodings provided by the
       package trf. See trf-intro for an overview of the whole package.

       This encoding transforms every block of four bytes (64 bit) into six
       english words, as defined in RFC 2289 (http://www.rfc-
       editor.org/rfc/rfc2289.txt).  This encoding is the sole one which is not
       able to handle an incomplete block at the end of the input.

       otp_words ?options...? ?data?

              -mode encode|decode
                     This option has to be present and is always understood by
                     the encoding.

                     For immediate mode the argument value specifies the
                     operation to use.  For an attached encoding it specifies
                     the operation to use for writing. Reading will
                     automatically use the reverse operation.  See section
                     IMMEDIATE versus ATTACHED for explanations of these two
                     terms.

                     Beyond the argument values listed above all unique
                     abbreviations are recognized too.

                     Encode converts from arbitrary (most likely binary) data
                     into the described representation, decode does the reverse
                     .

              -attach channel
                     The presence/absence of this option determines the main
                     operation mode of the transformation.

                     If present the transformation will be stacked onto the
                     channel whose handle was given to the option and run in
                     attached mode. More about this in section IMMEDIATE versus
                     ATTACHED.

                     If the option is absent the transformation is used in
                     immediate mode and the options listed below are recognized.
                     More about this in section IMMEDIATE versus ATTACHED.

              -in channel
                     This options is legal if and only if the transformation is
                     used in immediate mode. It provides the handle of the
                     channel the data to transform has to be read from.

                     If the transformation is in immediate mode and this option
                     is absent the data to transform is expected as the last
                     argument to the transformation.

              -out channel
                     This options is legal if and only if the transformation is
                     used in immediate mode. It provides the handle of the
                     channel the generated transformation result is written to.

                     If the transformation is in immediate mode and this option
                     is absent the generated data is returned as the result of
                     the command itself.

IMMEDIATE VERSUS ATTACHED
       The transformation distinguishes between two main ways of using it. These
       are the immediate and attached operation modes.

       For the attached mode the option -attach is used to associate the
       transformation with an existing channel. During the execution of the
       command no transformation is performed, instead the channel is changed in
       such a way, that from then on all data written to or read from it passes
       through the transformation and is modified by it according to the
       definition above.  This attachment can be revoked by executing the
       command unstack for the chosen channel. This is the only way to do this
       at the Tcl level.

       In the second mode, which can be detected by the absence of option
       -attach, the transformation immediately takes data from either its
       commandline or a channel, transforms it, and returns the result either as
       result of the command, or writes it into a channel.  The mode is named
       after the immediate nature of its execution.

       Where the data is taken from, and delivered to, is governed by the
       presence and absence of the options -in and -out.  It should be noted
       that this ability to immediately read from and/or write to a channel is
       an historic artifact which was introduced at the beginning of Trf's life
       when Tcl version 7.6 was current as this and earlier versions have
       trouble to deal with \0 characters embedded into either input or output.
