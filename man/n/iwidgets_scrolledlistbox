WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       Name:           dblClickCommand
       Class:          Command
       Command-Line Switch:           -dblclickcommand

              Specifies a Tcl command procedure which is called when an item is
              double clicked.  Typically this occurs when mouse button 1 is
              double clicked over an item.  Selection policy does not matter.

       Name:           height
       Class:          Height
       Command-Line Switch:           -height

              Specifies the height of the scrolled list box as an entire unit.
              The value may be specified in any of the forms acceptable to
              Tk_GetPixels.  Any additional space needed to display the other
              components such as labels, margins, and scrollbars force the
              listbox to be compressed.  A value of zero along with the same
              value for the width causes the value given for the visibleitems
              option to be applied which administers geometry constraints in a
              different manner.  The default height is zero.

       Name:           hscrollMode
       Class:          ScrollMode
       Command-Line Switch:           -hscrollmode

              Specifies the the display mode to be used for the horizontal
              scrollbar: static, dynamic, or none.  In static mode, the scroll
              bar is displayed at all times.  Dynamic mode displays the scroll
              bar as required, and none disables the scroll bar display.  The
              default is static.

       Name:           sbWidth
       Class:          Width
       Command-Line Switch:           -sbwidth

              Specifies the width of the scrollbar in any of the forms
              acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.  The default width is 15 pixels..

       Name:           scrollMargin
       Class:          Margin
       Command-Line Switch:           -scrollmargin

              Specifies the distance between the listbox and scrollbar in any of
              the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.  The default is 3 pixels.

       Name:           selectionCommand
       Class:          Command
       Command-Line Switch:           -selectioncommand

              Specifies a Tcl command procedure which is called when an item is
              selected.  Selection policy does not matter.

       Name:           state
       Class:          State
       Command-Line Switch:           -state

              Specifies one of two states for the listbox: normal or disabled.
              If the listbox is disabled then selection is ignored.  The default
              is normal.

       Name:           textBackground
       Class:          Background
       Command-Line Switch -textbackground

              Specifies the background color for the listbox.  This allows the
              background within the listbox to be different from the normal
              background color.

       Name:           textFont
       Class:          Font
       Command-Line Switch:           -textfont

              Specifies the font to be used for text in the listbox.  This
              allows for the font associated with text internal to the scrolled
              listbox to be different than the font for labels.

       Name:           visibleitems
       Class:          VisibleItems
       Command-Line Switch:           -visibleitems

              Specifies the widthxheight in characters and lines for the
              listbox.  This option is only administered if the width and height
              options are both set to zero, otherwise they take precedence.  The
              default value is 20x10.  With the visibleitems option engaged,
              geometry constraints are maintained only on the listbox.  The size
              of the other components such as labels, margins, and scroll bars,
              are additive and independent, effecting the overall size of the
              scrolled list box.  In contrast, should the width and height
              options have non zero values, they are applied to the scrolled
              list box as a whole.  The listbox is compressed or expanded to
              maintain the geometry constraints.

       Name:           vscrollMode
       Class:          ScrollMode
       Command-Line Switch:           -vscrollmode

              Specifies the the display mode to be used for the vertical
              scrollbar: static, dynamic, or none.  In static mode, the scroll
              bar is displayed at all times.  Dynamic mode displays the scroll
              bar as required, and none disables the scroll bar display.  The
              default is static.

       Name:           width
       Class:          Width
       Command-Line Switch:           -width

              Specifies the width of the scrolled list box as an entire unit.
              The value may be specified in any of the forms acceptable to
              Tk_GetPixels.  Any additional space needed to display the other
              components such as labels, margins, and scrollbars force the
              listbox to be compressed.  A value of zero along with the same
              value for the height causes the value given for the visibleitems
              option to be applied which administers geometry constraints in a
              different manner.  The default width is zero.

DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::scrolledlistbox command creates a scrolled listbox with
       additional options to manage horizontal and vertical scrollbars.  This
       includes options to control which scrollbars are displayed and the
       method, i.e. statically or dynamically.


METHODS
       The iwidgets::scrolledlistbox command creates a new Tcl command whose
       name is pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations
       on the widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.

       Many of the widget commands for a scrolledlistbox take as one argument an
       indicator of which entry of the list box to operate on.  These indicators
       are called indexes and may be specified in any of the following forms:

       number      Specifies the element as a numerical index, where 0
                   corresponds to the first element in the listbox.

       active      Indicates the element that has the location cursor.  This
                   element will be displayed with an underline when the listbox
                   has the keyboard focus, and it is specified with the activate
                   widget command.

       anchor      Indicates the anchor point for the selection, which is set
                   with the selection anchor widget command.

       end         Indicates the end of the listbox.  For some commands this
                   means just after the last element; for other commands it
                   means the last element.

       @x,y        Indicates the element that covers the point in the listbox
                   window specified by x and y (in pixel coordinates).  If no
                   element covers that point, then the closest element to that
                   point is used.

       pattern     If the index doesn't satisfy one of the above forms then this
                   form is used.  Pattern is pattern-matched against the items
                   in the list box, in order from the top down, until a matching
                   entry is found.  The rules of Tcl_StringMatch are used.

       The following widget commands are possible for scrolledlistbox widgets:


ASSOCIATED METHODS
       activate        bbox           curselection    delete
       get             index          insert          itemconfigure
       nearest         scan           see             selection
       size            xview          yview

       See the "listbox" manual entry for details on the associated methods.


WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::scrolledlistbox command.

       pathName clear
              Clears the listbox of all items.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::scrolledlistbox
              command.

       pathName getcurselection
              Returns the contents of the listbox element indicated by the
              current selection indexes.  Short cut version of get and
              curselection command combination.

       pathName justify direction
              Justifies the list contents via teh scroll bars in one of four
              directions: left, right, top, or bottom.

       pathName selecteditemcount
              Returns the number of items currently selected in the list.

       pathName sort order
              Sort the current list in any of the forms accepted by Tcl's lsort
              command.  Also accepts either ascending or descending order.
