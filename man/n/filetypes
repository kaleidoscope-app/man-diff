DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a command for the recognition of file types in pure
       Tcl.

       The core part of the recognizer was generated from a "magic(5)" file
       containing the checks to perform to recognize files, and associated file-
       types.

       Beware! This recognizer is large, about 276 Kilobyte of generated Tcl
       code.

       ::fileutil::magic::filetype filename
              This command is similar to the command fileutil::fileType.

              The output of the command for the specified file is a string
              describing the type of the file.

              This list will be empty if the type of the file is not recognized.

              magic definitions used by it. The latter were used by us to
              generate this recognizer.
