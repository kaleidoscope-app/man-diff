________________________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       A ttk::combobox combines a text field with a pop-down list of values; the
       user may select the value of the text field from among the values in the
       list.

STANDARD OPTIONS
       -class                -cursor              -takefocus
       -style

       See the ttk_widget manual entry for details on the standard options.

WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       [-exportselection exportSelection] Boolean value.  If set, the widget
       selection is linked to the X selection.  [-justify justify] Specifies how
       the text is aligned within the widget.  Must be one of left, center, or
       right.  [-height height] Specifies the height of the pop-down listbox, in
       rows.  [-postcommand postCommand] A Tcl script to evaluate immediately
       before displaying the listbox.  The -postcommand script may specify the
       -values to display.  [-state state] One of normal, readonly, or disabled.
       In the readonly state, the value may not be edited directly, and the user
       can only select one of the -values from the dropdown list.  In the normal
       state, the text field is directly editable.  In the disabled state, no
       interaction is possible.  [-textvariable textVariable] Specifies the name
       of a variable whose value is linked to the widget value.  Whenever the
       variable changes value the widget value is updated, and vice versa.
       [-values values] Specifies the list of values to display in the drop-down
       listbox.  [-width width] Specifies an integer value indicating the
       desired width of the entry window, in average-size characters of the
       widget's font.

WIDGET COMMAND
       The following subcommands are possible for combobox widgets:

       pathName current ?newIndex?
              If newIndex is supplied, sets the combobox value to the element at
              position newIndex in the list of -values.  Otherwise, returns the
              index of the current value in the list of -values or -1 if the
              current value does not appear in the list.

       pathName get
              Returns the current value of the combobox.

       pathName set value
              Sets the value of the combobox to value.

       The combobox widget also supports the following ttk::entry widget
       subcommands (see ttk::entry(n) for details):

              bbox                  delete               icursor
              index                 insert               selection
              xview

       The combobox widget also supports the following generic ttk::widget
       widget subcommands (see ttk::widget(n) for details):

              cget                  configure            identify
              instate               state


VIRTUAL EVENTS
       The combobox widget generates a <<ComboboxSelected>> virtual event when
       the user selects an element from the list of values.  If the selection
       action unposts the listbox, this event is delivered after the listbox is
       unposted.
