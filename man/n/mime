DESCRIPTION
       The mime library package provides the commands to create and manipulate
       MIME body parts.

       ::mime::initialize ?-canonical type/subtype ?-param {key value}...?
       ?-encoding value? ?-header {key value}...?? (-file name | -string value |
       -part {token1 ... tokenN})
              This command creates a MIME part and returns a token representing
              it.

              •      If the -canonical option is present, then the body is in
                     canonical (raw) form and is found by consulting either the
                     -file, -string, or -part option.

                     In addition, both the -param and -header options may occur
                     zero or more times to specify Content-Type parameters
                     (e.g., charset) and header keyword/values (e.g., Content-
                     Disposition), respectively.

                     Also, -encoding, if present, specifies the Content-
                     Transfer-Encoding when copying the body.

              •      If the -canonical option is not present, then the MIME part
                     contained in either the -file or the -string option is
                     parsed, dynamically generating subordinates as appropriate.

       ::mime::finalize token ?-subordinates all | dynamic | none?
              This command destroys the MIME part represented by token. It
              returns an empty string.

              If the -subordinates option is present, it specifies which
              subordinates should also be destroyed. The default value is
              dynamic, destroying all subordinates which were created by
              ::mime::initialize together with the containing body part.

       ::mime::getproperty token ?property | -names?
              This command returns a string or a list of strings containing the
              properties of a MIME part. If the command is invoked with the name
              of a specific property, then the corresponding value is returned;
              instead, if -names is specified, a list of all properties is
              returned; otherwise, a serialized array of properties and values
              is returned.

              The possible properties are:

              content
                     The type/subtype describing the content

              encoding
                     The "Content-Transfer-Encoding"

              params A list of "Content-Type" parameters

              parts  A list of tokens for the part's subordinates.  This
                     property is present only if the MIME part has subordinates.

              size   The approximate size of the content (unencoded)

       ::mime::getheader token ?key | -names?
              This command returns the header of a MIME part, as a list of
              strings.

              A header consists of zero or more key/value pairs. Each value is a
              list containing one or more strings.

              If this command is invoked with the name of a specific key, then a
              list containing the corresponding value(s) is returned; instead,
              if -names is specified, a list of all keys is returned; otherwise,
              a serialized array of keys and values is returned. Note that when
              a key is specified (e.g., "Subject"), the list returned usually
              contains exactly one string; however, some keys (e.g., "Received")
              often occur more than once in the header, accordingly the list
              returned usually contains more than one string.

       ::mime::setheader token key value ?-mode write | append | delete?
              This command writes, appends to, or deletes the value associated
              with a key in the header. It returns a list of strings containing
              the previous value associated with the key.

              The value for -mode is one of:

              write  The key/value is either created or overwritten (the
                     default).

              append A new value is appended for the key (creating it as
                     necessary).

              delete All values associated with the key are removed (the value
                     parameter is ignored).

       ::mime::getbody token ?-decode? ?-command callback ?-blocksize octets??
              This command returns a string containing the body of the leaf MIME
              part represented by token in canonical form.

              If the -command option is present, then it is repeatedly invoked
              with a fragment of the body as this:

                uplevel #0 $callback [list "data" $fragment]


              (The -blocksize option, if present, specifies the maximum size of
              each fragment passed to the callback.)

              When the end of the body is reached, the callback is invoked as:

                  uplevel #0 $callback "end"


              Alternatively, if an error occurs, the callback is invoked as:

                  uplevel #0 $callback [list "error" reason]


              Regardless, the return value of the final invocation of the
              callback is propagated upwards by ::mime::getbody.

              If the -command option is absent, then the return value of
              ::mime::getbody is a string containing the MIME part's entire
              body.

              If the option -decode is absent the return value computed above is
              returned as is. This means that it will be in the charset
              specified for the token and not the usual utf-8.  If the option
              -decode is present however the command will use the charset
              information associated with the token to convert the string from
              its encoding into utf-8 before returning it.

       ::mime::copymessage token channel
              This command copies the MIME represented by token part to the
              specified channel. The command operates synchronously, and uses
              fileevent to allow asynchronous operations to proceed
              independently. It returns an empty string.

       ::mime::buildmessage token
              This command returns the MIME part represented by token as a
              string.  It is similar to ::mime::copymessage, only it returns the
              data as a return string instead of writing to a channel.

       ::mime::parseaddress string
              This command takes a string containing one or more 822-style
              address specifications and returns a list of serialized arrays,
              one element for each address specified in the argument. If the
              string contains more than one address they will be separated by
              commas.

              Each serialized array contains the properties below. Note that one
              or more of these properties may be empty.

              address
                     local@domain

              comment
                     822-style comment

              domain the domain part (rhs)

              error  non-empty on a parse error

              group  this address begins a group

              friendly
                     user-friendly rendering

              local  the local part (lhs)

              memberP
                     this address belongs to a group

              phrase the phrase part

              proper 822-style address specification

              route  822-style route specification (obsolete)

       ::mime::parsedatetime (string | -now) property
              This command takes a string containing an 822-style date-time
              specification and returns the specified property as a serialized
              array.

              The list of properties and their ranges are:

              hour   0 .. 23

              lmonth January, February, ..., December

              lweekday
                     Sunday, Monday, ... Saturday

              mday   1 .. 31

              min    0 .. 59

              mon    1 .. 12

              month  Jan, Feb, ..., Dec

              proper 822-style date-time specification

              rclock elapsed seconds between then and now

              sec    0 .. 59

              wday   0 .. 6 (Sun .. Mon)

              weekday
                     Sun, Mon, ..., Sat

              yday   1 .. 366

              year   1900 ...

              zone   -720 .. 720 (minutes east of GMT)

       ::mime::mapencoding encoding_name
              This commansd maps tcl encodings onto the proper names for their
              MIME charset type.  This is only done for encodings whose charset
              types were known.  The remaining encodings return "" for now.

       ::mime::reversemapencoding charset_type
              This command maps MIME charset types onto tcl encoding names.
              Those that are unknown return "".

KNOWN BUGS
       SourceForge Tcllib Bug #447037
              This problem affects only people which are using Tcl and Mime on a
              64-bit system. The currently recommended fix for this problem is
              to upgrade to Tcl version 8.4. This version has extended 64 bit
              support and the bug does not appear anymore.

              The problem could have been generally solved by requiring the use
              of Tcl 8.4 for this package. We decided against this solution as
              it would force a large number of unaffected users to upgrade their
              Tcl interpreter for no reason.
