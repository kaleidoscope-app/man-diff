NAME
       is - test argument to see if it is a class or an object

SYNOPSIS
       itcl::is option ?arg arg ...?
________________________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       The is command is used to check if the argument given is a class or an
       object; depending on the option given. If the argument if a class or
       object, then 1 is returned. Otherwise, 0 is returned.  The is command
       also recognizes the commands wrapped in the itcl code command.

       The option argument determines what action is carried out by the command.
       The legal options (which may be abbreviated) are:

       is class command
              Returns 1 if command is a class, and returns 0 otherwise.

              The fully qualified name of the class needs to be given as the
              command argument. So, if a class resides in a namespace, then the
              namespace needs to be specified as well. So, if a class C resides
              in a namespace N, then the command should be called like:
              is N::C
                  or
              is ::N::C

       is object ?-class className? command
              Returns 1 if command is an object, and returns 0 otherwise.

              If the optional "-class" parameter is specified, then the command
              will be checked within the context of the class given. Note that
              className has to exist. If not, then an error will be given. So,
              if className is uncertain to be a class, then the programmer will
              need to check it's existance beforehand, or wrap it in a catch
              statement.

              So, if c is an object in the class C, in namespace N then these
              are the possibilities (all return 1):
              set obj [N::C c]
              itcl::is object N::c
              itcl::is object c
              itcl::is object $obj
              itcl::is object [itcl::code c]
