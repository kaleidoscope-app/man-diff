DESCRIPTION
       This document specifies both names and syntax of all the commands which
       together are the doctools markup language, version 1.  As this document
       is intended to be a reference the commands are listed in alphabetical
       order, and the descriptions are relatively short.  A beginner should read
       the much more informally written doctools language introduction first.

COMMANDS
       arg text
              Text markup. The argument text is marked up as the argument of a
              command. Main uses are the highlighting of command arguments in
              free-form text, and for the argument parameters of the markup
              commands call and usage.

       arg_def type name ?mode?
              Text structure. List element. Argument list. Automatically closes
              the previous list element. Specifies the data-type of the
              described argument of a command, its name and its i/o-mode. The
              latter is optional.

       bullet Deprecated. Text structure. List element. Itemized list. See item
              for the canonical command to open a list item in an itemized list.

       call args
              Text structure. List element. Definition list. Automatically
              closes the previous list element. Defines the term as a command
              and its arguments.  The first argument is the name of the command
              described by the following free-form text, and all arguments
              coming after that are descriptions of the command's arguments.  It
              is expected that the arguments are marked up with arg, method,
              option etc., as is appropriate, and that the command itself is
              marked up with cmd.  It is expected that the formatted term is not
              only printed in place, but also in the table of contents of the
              document, or synopsis, depending on the output format.

       category text
              Document information. Anywhere. This command registers its plain
              text arguments as the category this document belongs to. If this
              command is used multiple times the last value specified is used.

       class text
              Text markup. The argument is marked up as the name of a class. The
              text may have other markup already applied to it. Main use is the
              highlighting of class names in free-form text.

       cmd text
              Text markup. The argument text is marked up as the name of a Tcl
              command. The text may have other markup already applied to it.
              Main uses are the highlighting of commands in free-form text, and
              for the command parameters of the markup commands call and usage.

       cmd_def command
              Text structure. List element. Command list. Automatically closes
              the previous list element. The argument specifies the name of the
              Tcl command to be described by the list element. Expected to be
              marked up in the output as if it had been formatted with cmd.

       comment plaintext
              Text markup. The argument text is marked up as a comment standing
              outside of the actual text of the document. Main use is in free-
              form text.

       const text
              Text markup. The argument is marked up as a constant value. The
              text may have other markup already applied to it. Main use is the
              highlighting of constants in free-form text.

       copyright text
              Document information. Anywhere. The command registers the plain
              text argument as a copyright assignment for the manpage. When
              invoked more than once the assignments are accumulated.

       def text
              Text structure. List element. Definition list. Automatically
              closes the previous list element. The argument text is the term
              defined by the new list element. Text markup can be applied to it.

       description
              Document structure. This command separates the header from the
              document body.  Implicitly starts a section named "DESCRIPTION"
              (See command section).

       enum   Text structure. List element. Enumerated list. Automatically
              closes the previous list element.

       emph text
              Text markup. The argument text is marked up as emphasized. Main
              use is for general highlighting of pieces of free-form text
              without attaching special meaning to the pieces.

       example text
              Text structure, Text markup. This command marks its argument up as
              an example. Main use is the simple embedding of examples in free-
              form text. It should be used if the example does not need special
              markup of its own. Otherwise use a sequence of example_begin ...
              example_end.

       example_begin
              Text structure. This commands starts an example. All text until
              the next example_end belongs to the example. Line breaks, spaces,
              and tabs have to be preserved literally. Examples cannot be
              nested.

       example_end
              Text structure. This command closes the example started by the
              last example_begin.

       file text
              Text markup. The argument is marked up as a file or directory,
              i.e. in general a path. The text may have other markup already
              applied to it. Main use is the highlighting of paths in free-form
              text.

       fun text
              Text markup. The argument is marked up as the name of a function.
              The text may have other markup already applied to it. Main use is
              the highlighting of function names in free-form text.

       image name ?label?
              Text markup. The argument is the symbolic name of an image and
              replaced with the image itself, if a suitable variant is found by
              the backend. The second argument, should it be present, will be
              interpreted the human-readable description of the image, and put
              into the output in a suitable position, if such is supported by
              the format. The HTML format, for example, can place it into the
              alt attribute of image references.

       include filename
              Templating. The contents of the named file are interpreted as text
              written in the doctools markup and processed in the place of the
              include command. The markup in the file has to be self-contained.
              It is not possible for a markup command to cross the file
              boundaries.

       item   Text structure. List element. Itemized list. Automatically closes
              the previous list element.

       keywords args
              Document information. Anywhere. This command registers all its
              plain text arguments as keywords applying to this document. Each
              argument is a single keyword. If this command is used multiple
              times all the arguments accumulate.

       lb     Text. The command is replaced with a left bracket. Use in free-
              form text.  Required to avoid interpretation of a left bracket as
              the start of a markup command.

       list_begin what
              Text structure. This command starts a list. The exact nature of
              the list is determined by the argument what of the command. This
              further determines which commands are have to be used to start the
              list elements. Lists can be nested, i.e. it is allowed to start a
              new list within a list element.

              The allowed types (and their associated item commands) are:

              arguments
                     arg_def.

              commands
                     cmd_def.

              definitions
                     def and call.

              enumerated
                     enum

              itemized
                     item

              options
                     opt_def

              tkoptions
                     tkoption_def

       Additionally the following names are recognized as shortcuts for some of
       the regular types:

              args   Short for arguments.

              cmds   Short for commands.

              enum   Short for enumerated.

              item   Short for itemized.

              opts   Short for options.

       At last the following names are still recognized for backward
       compatibility, but are otherwise considered to be deprecated.

              arg    Deprecated. See arguments.

              bullet Deprecated. See itemized.

              cmd    Deprecated. See commands.

              of the manpages this manpage resides in, and the version of the
              module containing the command. All arguments have to be plain
              text, without markup.

       manpage_end

              the document coming after this command is in error.

       method text
              Text markup. The argument text is marked up as the name of an
              object method, i.e. subcommand of a Tcl command. The text may have
              other markup already applied to it. Main uses are the highlighting
              of method names in free-form text, and for the command parameters

       opt_def name ?arg?
              Text structure. List element. Option list. Automatically closes
              the previous list element. Specifies name and arguments of the
              option described by the list element. It is expected that the name
              is marked up using option.

       option text
              Text markup. The argument is marked up as option. The text may
              have other markup already applied to it. Main use is the

       rb     Text. The command is replaced with a right bracket. Use in free-
              form text.  Required to avoid interpretation of a right bracket as
              the end of a markup command.

       require package ?version?
              Document information. Header. This command registers its argument
              package as the name of a package or application required by the
              described package or application. A minimum version can be
              provided as well. This argument can be marked up. The usual markup

       sectref-external text
              Text markup. Like sectref, except that the section is assumed to
              be in a different document and therefore doesn't need to be
              identified, nor are any checks for existence made. Only the text
              to format is needed.

       see_also args
              Document information. Anywhere. The command defines direct cross-
              references to other documents. Each argument is a plain text label
              identifying the referenced document. If this command is used
              multiple times all the arguments accumulate.

       strong text

              emphasize text.

       subsection name
              Text structure. This command starts a new named subsection of a

              first paragraph of the new subsection.

       syscmd text
              Text markup. The argument text is marked up as the name of an
              external command. The text may have other markup already applied
              to it. Main use is the highlighting of external commands in free-
              form text.

       term text
              Text markup. The argument is marked up as unspecific terminology.
              The text may have other markup already applied to it. Main use is
              the highlighting of important terms and concepts in free-form
              text.

       titledesc desc
              Document information. Header. Optional. Registers the plain text
              argument as the title of the manpage. Defaults to the value
              registered by moddesc.

       tkoption_def name dbname dbclass
              Text structure. List element. Widget option list. Automatically
              closes the previous list element. Specifies the name of the option
              as used in scripts, the name used by the option database (dbname),
              and its class (dbclass), i.e. its type. It is expected that the
              name is marked up using option.

       type text
              Text markup. The argument is marked up as the name of a data type.
              The text may have other markup already applied to it. Main use is
              the highlighting of data types in free-form text.

       uri text ?text?
              Text markup. The argument is marked up as an uri (i.e. a uniform
              resource identifier. The text may have other markup already
              applied to it. Main use is the highlighting of uris in free-form
              text. The second argument, should it be present, will be
              interpreted the human-readable description of the uri. In other
              words, as its label. Without an explicit label the uri will be its
              own label.

       usage args
              Text markup. See call for the full description, this command is
              syntactically identical, as it is in its expectations for the
              markup of its arguments.  In contrast to call it is however not
              allowed to generate output where this command occurs in the text.
              The command is silent.  The formatted text may only appear in a
              different section of the output, for example a table of contents,
              or synopsis, depending on the output format.

       var text
              Text markup. The argument is marked up as the name of a variable.
              The text may have other markup already applied to it. Main use is
              the highlighting of variables in free-form text.

       vset varname value
              Templating. In this form the command sets the named document
              variable to the specified value. It does not generate output. I.e.
              the command is replaced by the empty string.

       vset varname
              Templating. In this form the command is replaced by the value of
              the named document variable

       widget text
              Text markup. The argument is marked up as the name of a widget.
              The text may have other markup already applied to it. Main use is
