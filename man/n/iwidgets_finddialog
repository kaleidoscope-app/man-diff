              Specifies a command to be invoked following a clear operation.
              The option is meant to be used as means of notification that the
              clear has taken place and allow other actions to take place such

              that the match is located.  Should a match not be found the match
              point is {}.  The option is meant to be used as a means of
              notification that the find operation has completed and allow other

DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::finddialog command creates a find dialog that works in
       conjunction with a text or scrolledtext widget to provide a means of
       performing search operations.  The user is prompted for a text pattern to
       be found in the text or scrolledtext widget.  The search can be for all
       occurances, by regular expression, considerate of the case, or backwards.


METHODS
       The iwidgets::finddialog command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
       pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
       widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following commands are possible for finddialog widgets:

INHERITED METHODS
       add             buttonconfigure                defaulthide
       invoke          show

       See the "buttonbox" widget manual entry for details on the above
       inherited methods.

       activate        center         deactivate

       See the "shell" widget manual entry for details on the above inherited
       methods.

WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::finddialog command.

       pathName clear
              Clears the pattern in the entry field and the pattern matchin
              indicators in the text or scrolledtext widget.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::finddialog command.

       pathName find
              Search for a specific text string in the text widget given by the
              -textwidget option.  This method is the standard callback for the
              Find button.  It is made available such that it can be bound to a
              find again action.


COMPONENTS
       Name:           all
       Class:          Checkbutton

              The all component specifies that all the matches of the pattern

       Name:           backwards
       Class:          Checkbutton

              for details on the backwards component item.

              The case component specifies that the case of the pattern should
              be taken into consideration when performing the search.  See the
