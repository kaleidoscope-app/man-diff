DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::dialogshell command creates a dialog shell which is a top
       level widget composed of a button box, separator, and child site area.
       The class also has methods to control button construction.


METHODS
       The iwidgets::dialogshell command create a new Tcl command whose name is
       pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
       widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following commands are possible for dialogshell widgets:

INHERITED METHODS
       activate        center         deactivate

       See the "shell" manual entry for details on the above inherited methods.

ASSOCIATED METHODS
       add             buttonconfigure                defaultdelete
       hide            index          insert          invoke
       show

       See the "buttonbox" manual entry for details on the associated methods.

WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::dialogshell command.

       pathName childsite
              Returns the pathname of the child site widget.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::dialogshell command.
