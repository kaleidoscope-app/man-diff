NAME
       ttk::scale - Create and manipulate a scale widget

SYNOPSIS
       ttk::scale pathName ?options...?
________________________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       A ttk::scale widget is typically used to control the numeric value of a
       linked variable that varies uniformly over some range. A scale displays a
       slider that can be moved along over a trough, with the relative position
       of the slider over the trough indicating the value of the variable.

STANDARD OPTIONS
       -class                -cursor              -style
       -takefocus

       See the ttk_widget manual entry for details on the standard options.

WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       [-command command] Specifies the prefix of a Tcl command to invoke
       whenever the scale's value is changed via a widget command. The actual
       command consists of this option followed by a space and a real number
       indicating the new value of the scale.  [-from from] A real value
       corresponding to the left or top end of the scale.  [-length length]
       Specifies the desired long dimension of the scale in screen units (i.e.
       any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels). For vertical scales this is
       the scale's height; for horizontal scales it is the scale's width.
       [-orient orient] Specifies which orientation whether the widget should be
       laid out horizontally or vertically. Must be either horizontal or
       vertical or an abbreviation of one of these.  [-to to] Specifies a real
       value corresponding to the right or bottom end of the scale.  This value
       may be either less than or greater than the from option.  [-value value]
       Specifies the current floating-point value of the variable.
       [-variable variable] Specifies the name of a global variable to link to
       the scale. Whenever the value of the variable changes, the scale will
       update to reflect this value.  Whenever the scale is manipulated
       interactively, the variable will be modified to reflect the scale's new
       value.

WIDGET COMMAND
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the specified option; see
              ttk::widget(n).

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Modify or query widget options; see ttk::widget(n).

       pathName get ?x y?
              Get the current value of the -value option, or the value
              corresponding to the coordinates x,y if they are specified. X and
              y are pixel coordinates relative to the scale widget origin.

       pathName identify x y
              Returns the name of the element at position x, y.  See
              ttk::widget(n).

       pathName instate statespec ?script?
              Test the widget state; see ttk::widget(n).

       pathName set value
              Set the value of the widget (i.e. the -value option) to value.
              The value will be clipped to the range given by the -from and -to
              options. Note that setting the linked variable (i.e. the variable
              named in the -variable option) does not cause such clipping.

       pathName state ?stateSpec?
              Modify or query the widget state; see ttk::widget(n).

INTERNAL COMMANDS
       pathName coords ?value?
              Get the coordinates corresponding to value, or the coordinates
              corresponding to the current value of the -value option if value
              is omitted.
