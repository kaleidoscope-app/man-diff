DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a single utility command for easy dataflow based
       manipulation of arbitrary data structures, especially abstract syntax
       trees.

API
       ::page::util::flow start flowvar nodevar script
              This command contains the core logic to drive the walking of an
              arbitrary data structure which can partitioned into separate
              parts. Examples of such structures are trees and graphs.

              The command makes no assumptions at all about the API of the
              structure to be walked, except that that its parts, here called
              nodes, are identified by strings. These strings are taken as is,
              from the arguments, and the body, and handed back to the body,
              without modification.

              Access to the actual data structure, and all decisions regarding
              which nodes to visit in what order are delegated to the body of
              the loop, i.e. the script.

              The body is invoked first for the nodes in the start-set specified
              via start), and from then on for the nodes the body has requested
              to be visited. The command stops when the set of nodes to visit
              becomes empty. Note that a node can be visited more than once. The
              body has complete control about this.

              The body is invoked in the context of the caller. The variable
              named by nodevar will be set to the current node, and the variable
              named by flowvar will be set to the command of the flow object
              through which the body can request the nodes to visit next. The
              API provided by this object is described in the next section, FLOW
              API.

              Note that the command makes no promises regarding the order in
              which nodes are visited, excpt that the nodes requested to be
              visited by the current iteration will be visited afterward, in
              some order.

FLOW API
       This section describes the API provided by the flow object made
       accessible to the body script of ::page::util::flow.

       flow visit node
              Invoking this method requests that the node n is visited after the
              current iteration.

       flow visitl nodelist
              Invoking this method requests that all the nodes found in the list
              nodelist are visited after the current iteration.

       flow visita node...
              This is the variadic arguments form of the method visitl, see
              above.
