DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a few utility commands to convert characters into
       various forms.

API
       ::page::util::quote::unquote char
              A character, as stored in an abstract syntax tree by a PEG
              processor (See the packages grammar::peg::interpreter,
              grammar::me, and their relations), i.e. in some quoted form, is
              converted into the equivalent Tcl character. The character is
              returned as the result of the command.

       ::page::util::quote::quote'tcl char
              This command takes a Tcl character (internal representation) and
              converts it into a string which is accepted by the Tcl parser,
              will regenerate the character in question and is 7bit ASCII. The
              string is returned as the result of this command.

       ::page::util::quote::quote'tclstr char
              This command takes a Tcl character (internal representation) and
              converts it into a string which is accepted by the Tcl parser and
              will generate a human readable representation of the character in
              question.  The string is returned as the result of this command.

              The string does not use any unprintable characters. It may use
              backslash-quoting. High UTF characters are quoted to avoid
              problems with the still prevalent ascii terminals. It is assumed
              that the string will be used in a double-quoted environment.

       ::page::util::quote::quote'tclcom char
              This command takes a Tcl character (internal representation) and
              converts it into a string which is accepted by the Tcl parser when
              used within a Tcl comment. The string is returned as the result of
              this command.
