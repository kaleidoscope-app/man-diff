NAME

DESCRIPTION
       This command takes the contents of the specified file or resource and
       passes it to the Tcl interpreter as a text script.  The return value from
       source is the return value of the last command executed in the script.
       If an error occurs in evaluating the contents of the script then the
       source command will return that error.  If a return command is invoked
       from within the script then the remainder of the file will be skipped and
       the source command will return normally with the result from the return
       command.

       The end-of-file character for files is “\32” (^Z) for all platforms.  The
       source command will read files up to this character.  This restriction
       does not exist for the read or gets commands, allowing for files
       containing code and data segments (scripted documents).  If you require a
       “^Z” in code for string comparison, you can use “\032” or “\u001a”, which
       will be safely substituted by the Tcl interpreter into “^Z”.

       The -encoding option is used to specify the encoding of the data stored   │
       in fileName.  When the -encoding option is omitted, the system encoding   │
       is assumed.

EXAMPLE
       Run the script in the file foo.tcl and then the script in the file
       bar.tcl:
              source foo.tcl
              source bar.tcl
       Alternatively:
              foreach scriptFile {foo.tcl bar.tcl} {
                 source $scriptFile
              }
