DESCRIPTION
       A ttk::panedwindow widget displays a number of subwindows, stacked either
       vertically or horizontally.  The user may adjust the relative sizes of
       the subwindows by dragging the sash between panes.

STANDARD OPTIONS
       -class                -cursor              -takefocus
       -style

       See the ttk_widget manual entry for details on the standard options.

WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       [-orient orient] Specifies the orientation of the window.  If vertical,
       subpanes are stacked top-to-bottom; if horizontal, subpanes are stacked
       left-to-right.  [-width width] If present and greater than zero,
       specifies the desired width of the widget in pixels.  Otherwise, the
       requested width is determined by the width of the managed windows.
       [-height height] If present and greater than zero, specifies the desired
       height of the widget in pixels.  Otherwise, the requested height is
       determined by the height of the managed windows.

PANE OPTIONS
       The following options may be specified for each pane: [-weight weight] An
       integer specifying the relative stretchability of the pane.  When the
       paned window is resized, the extra space is added or subtracted to each
       pane proportionally to its -weight.

WIDGET COMMAND
       Supports the standard configure, cget, state, and instate commands; see
       ttk::widget(n) for details.  Additional commands:

       pathname add subwindow options...
              Adds a new pane to the window.  See PANE OPTIONS for the list of
              available options.

       pathname forget pane
              Removes the specified subpane from the widget.  pane is either an
              integer index or the name of a managed subwindow.

       pathname identify component x y
              Returns the name of the element under the point given by x and y,
              or the empty string if no component is present at that location.
              If component is omitted, it defaults to sash.  The following
              subcommands are supported:

              pathname identify element x y
                     Returns the name of the element at the specified location.

              pathname identify sash x y
                     Returns the index of the sash at the specified location.

       pathname insert pos subwindow options...
              Inserts a pane at the specified position.  pos is either the
              string end, an integer index, or the name of a managed subwindow.
              If subwindow is already managed by the paned window, moves it to
              the specified position.  See PANE OPTIONS for the list of
              available options.

       pathname pane pane -option ?value ?-option value...
              Query or modify the options of the specified pane, where pane is
              either an integer index or the name of a managed subwindow.  If no
              -option is specified, returns a dictionary of the pane option
              values.  If one -option is specified, returns the value of that
              option.  Otherwise, sets the -options to the corresponding values.

       pathname panes
              Returns the list of all windows managed by the widget.

       pathname sashpos index ?newpos?
              If newpos is specified, sets the position of sash number index.
              May adjust the positions of adjacent sashes to ensure that
              positions are monotonically increasing.  Sash positions are
              further constrained to be between 0 and the total size of the
              widget.  Returns the new position of sash number index.
