DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::mainwindow command creates a mainwindow shell which
       contains a menubar, toolbar, mousebar, childsite, status line, and help
       line.  Each item may be filled and configured to suit individual needs.


METHODS
       The iwidgets::mainwindow command create a new Tcl command whose name is
       pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
       widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following commands are possible for mainwindow widgets:

INHERITED METHODS
       activate        center         deactivate

       See the "shell" manual entry for details on the above inherited methods.

WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::mainwindow command.

       pathName childsite
              Returns the pathname of the child site widget.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::mainwindow command.

       pathName menubar ?args?
              The menubar method provides access to the menubar.  Invoked with
              no arguments it returns the pathname of the menubar.  With
              arguments, they are evaluated against the menubar which in effect
              provides access to the entire API of the menubar.  See the
              "menubar" manual entry for details on the commands available in
              the menubar.

       pathName mousebar ?args?
              The mousebar method provides access to the mousebar which is a
              vertical toolbar.  Invoked with no arguments it returns the
              pathname of the mousebar.  With arguments, they are evaluated
              against the mousebar which in effect provides access to the entire
              API of the underlying toolbar.  See the "toolbar" manual entry for
              details on the commands available in the mousebar.

       pathName msgd ?args?
              The msgd method provides access to the messagedialog contained in
              the mainwindow.  Invoked with no arguments it returns the pathname
              of the messagedialog.  With arguments, they are evaluated against
              the messagedialog which in effect provides access to the entire
              API of the messagedialog.  See the "messagedialog" manual entry
              for details on the commands available in the messagedialog.

       pathName toolbar ?args?
              The toolbar method provides access to the toolbar.  Invoked with
              no arguments it returns the pathname of the toolbar.  With
              arguments, they are evaluated against the toolbar which in effect
              provides access to the entire API of the toolbar.  See the
              "toolbar" manual entry for details on the commands available in
              the toolbar.
