NAME
       find - search for classes and objects

SYNOPSIS
       itcl::find option ?arg arg ...?
________________________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       The find command is used to find classes and objects that are available
       in the current interpreter.  Classes and objects are reported first in
       the active namespace, then in all other namespaces in the interpreter.

       The option argument determines what action is carried out by the command.
       The legal options (which may be abbreviated) are:

       find classes ?pattern?
              Returns a list of [incr Tcl] classes.  Classes in the current
              namespace are listed first, followed by classes in all other
              namespaces in the interpreter.  If the optional pattern is
              specified, then the reported names are compared using the rules of
              the "string match" command, and only matching names are reported.

              If a class resides in the current namespace context, this command
              reports its simple name--without any qualifiers.  However, if the
              pattern contains :: qualifiers, or if the class resides in another
              context, this command reports its fully-qualified name.
              Therefore, you can use the following command to obtain a list
              where all names are fully-qualified:
              itcl::find classes ::*

       find objects ?pattern? ?-class className? ?-isa className?
              Returns a list of [incr Tcl] objects.  Objects in the current
              namespace are listed first, followed by objects in all other
              namespaces in the interpreter.  If the optional pattern is
              specified, then the reported names are compared using the rules of
              the "string match" command, and only matching names are reported.
              If the optional "-class" parameter is specified, this list is
              restricted to objects whose most-specific class is className.  If
              the optional "-isa" parameter is specified, this list is further
              restricted to objects having the given className anywhere in their
              heritage.

              If an object resides in the current namespace context, this
              command reports its simple name--without any qualifiers.  However,
              if the pattern contains :: qualifiers, or if the object resides in
              another context, this command reports its fully-qualified name.
              Therefore, you can use the following command to obtain a list
              where all names are fully-qualified:
              itcl::find objects ::*
