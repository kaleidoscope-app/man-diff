DESCRIPTION
       The package textutil::tabify provides commands that convert between
       tabulation and ordinary whitespace in strings.

       The complete set of procedures is described below.

       ::textutil::tabify::tabify string ?num?
              Tabify the string by replacing any substring of num space chars by
              a tabulation and return the result as a new string. num defaults
              to 8.

       ::textutil::tabify::tabify2 string ?num?
              Similar to ::textutil::tabify this command tabifies the string and
              returns the result as a new string. A different algorithm is used
              however. Instead of replacing any substring of num spaces this
              command works more like an editor. num defaults to 8.

              Each line of the text in string is treated as if there are
              tabstops every num columns. Only sequences of space characters
              containing more than one space character and found immediately
              before a tabstop are replaced with tabs.

       ::textutil::tabify::untabify string ?num?
              Untabify the string by replacing any tabulation char by a
              substring of num space chars and return the result as a new
              string. num defaults to 8.

       ::textutil::tabify::untabify2 string ?num?
              Untabify the string by replacing any tabulation char by a
              substring of at most num space chars and return the result as a
              new string. Unlike textutil::tabify::untabify each tab is not
              replaced by a fixed number of space characters.  The command
              overlays each line in the string with tabstops every num columns
              instead and replaces tabs with just enough space characters to
              reach the next tabstop. This is the complement of the actions
              taken by ::textutil::tabify::tabify2. num defaults to 8.

              There is one asymmetry though: A tab can be replaced with a single
              space, but not the other way around.
