DESCRIPTION
       The scrolledframe combines the functionallity of scrolling with that of a
       typical frame widget to implement a clipable viewing area whose visible
       region may be modified with the scroll bars. This enables the contruction
       of visually larger areas than which could normally be displayed,
       containing a heterogenous mix of other widgets. Options exist which allow
       full control over which scrollbars are displayed and the method, i.e.
       statically or dynamically. The frame itself may be accessed by the
       childsite method and then filled with other widget combinations.


METHODS
       The iwidgets::scrolledframe command creates a new Tcl command whose name
       is pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on
       the widget.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following commands are possible for scrolledframe widgets:

       See the "canvas" manual entry for details on the associated methods.


WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::scrolledframe command.

       pathName childsite
              Return the path name of the child site.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::scrolledframe command.

       pathName justify direction
              Justifies the frame contents via the scroll bars in one of four
              directions: left, right, top, or bottom.
