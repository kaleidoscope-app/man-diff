rename(n)                     Tcl Built-In Commands                    rename(n)



________________________________________________________________________________

NAME
       rename - Rename or delete a command

SYNOPSIS
       rename oldName newName
________________________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       Rename the command that used to be called oldName so that it is now
       called newName.  If newName is an empty string then oldName is deleted.
       oldName and newName may include namespace qualifiers (names of containing
       namespaces).  If a command is renamed into a different namespace, future
       invocations of it will execute in the new namespace.  The rename command
       returns an empty string as result.

EXAMPLE
       The rename command can be used to wrap the standard Tcl commands with
       your own monitoring machinery.  For example, you might wish to count how
       often the source command is called:
              rename ::source ::theRealSource
              set sourceCount 0
              proc ::source args {
                  global sourceCount
                  puts "called source for the [incr sourceCount]'th time"
                  uplevel 1 ::theRealSource $args
              }
