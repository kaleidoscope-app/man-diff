SYNOPSIS
       package require Tcl

       package require memchan

       random

________________________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       random creates a random channel which absorbs everything written into it
              and uses it as a seed for a random number generator. This
              generator is used to create a random sequence of bytes when
              reading from the channel. It is not possible to seek the channel.

OPTIONS
       Memory channels created by random provide one additional option to set or
       query.

       -delay ?milliseconds?
              A random channel is always writable and readable. This means that
              all fileevent-handlers will fire continuously.  To avoid
              starvation of other event sources the events raised by this
              channel type have a configurable delay. This option is set in
              milliseconds and defaults to 5.
