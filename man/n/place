NAME
       place - Geometry manager for fixed or rubber-sheet placement

SYNOPSIS
       place option arg ?arg ...?
________________________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       The placer is a geometry manager for Tk.  It provides simple fixed
       placement of windows, where you specify the exact size and location of
       one window, called the slave, within another window, called the master.
       The placer also provides rubber-sheet placement, where you specify the
       size and location of the slave in terms of the dimensions of the master,
       so that the slave changes size and location in response to changes in the
       size of the master.  Lastly, the placer allows you to mix these styles of
       placement so that, for example, the slave has a fixed width and height
       but is centered inside the master.

       place window option value ?option value ...?
              Arrange for the placer to manage the geometry of a slave whose
              pathName is window.  The remaining arguments consist of one or
              more option-value pairs that specify the way in which window's
              geometry is managed.  Option may have any of the values accepted
              by the place configure command.

       place configure window ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the geometry options of the slave given by window.
              If no option is specified, this command returns a list describing
              the available options (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on the
              format of this list).  If option is specified with no value, then
              the command returns a list describing the one named option (this
              list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value
              returned if no option is specified).  If one or more option-value
              pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given option(s)
              to have the given value(s); in this case the command returns an
              empty string.

              The following option-value pairs are supported:

              -anchor where
                     Where specifies which point of window is to be positioned
                     at the (x,y) location selected by the -x, -y, -relx, and
                     -rely options.  The anchor point is in terms of the outer
                     area of window including its border, if any.  Thus if where
                     is se then the lower-right corner of window's border will
                     appear at the given (x,y) location in the master.  The
                     anchor position defaults to nw.

              -bordermode mode
                     Mode determines the degree to which borders within the
                     master are used in determining the placement of the slave.
                     The default and most common value is inside.  In this case
                     the placer considers the area of the master to be the
                     innermost area of the master, inside any border: an option
                     of -x 0 corresponds to an x-coordinate just inside the
                     border and an option of -relwidth 1.0 means window will
                     fill the area inside the master's border.

                     If mode is outside then the placer considers the area of
                     the master to include its border; this mode is typically
                     used when placing window outside its master, as with the
                     options -x 0 -y 0 -anchor ne.  Lastly, mode may be
                     specified as ignore, in which case borders are ignored:
                     the area of the master is considered to be its official X
                     area, which includes any internal border but no external
                     border.  A bordermode of ignore is probably not very
                     useful.

              -height size
                     Size specifies the height for window in screen units (i.e.
                     any of the forms accepted by Tk_GetPixels).  The height
                     will be the outer dimension of window including its border,
                     if any.  If size is an empty string, or if no -height or
                     -relheight option is specified, then the height requested
                     internally by the window will be used.

              -in master
                     Master specifies the path name of the window relative to
                     which window is to be placed.  Master must either be
                     window's parent or a descendant of window's parent.  In
                     addition, master and window must both be descendants of the
                     same top-level window.  These restrictions are necessary to
                     guarantee that window is visible whenever master is
                     visible.  If this option is not specified then the master
                     defaults to window's parent.

              -relheight size
                     Size specifies the height for window.  In this case the
                     height is specified as a floating-point number relative to
                     the height of the master: 0.5 means window will be half as
                     high as the master, 1.0 means window will have the same
                     height as the master, and so on.  If both -height and
                     -relheight are specified for a slave, their values are
                     summed.  For example, -relheight 1.0 -height -2 makes the
                     slave 2 pixels shorter than the master.

              -relwidth size
                     Size specifies the width for window.  In this case the
                     width is specified as a floating-point number relative to
                     the width of the master: 0.5 means window will be half as
                     wide as the master, 1.0 means window will have the same
                     width as the master, and so on.  If both -width and
                     -relwidth are specified for a slave, their values are
                     summed.  For example, -relwidth 1.0 -width 5 makes the
                     slave 5 pixels wider than the master.

              -relx location
                     Location specifies the x-coordinate within the master
                     window of the anchor point for window.  In this case the
                     location is specified in a relative fashion as a floating-
                     point number:  0.0 corresponds to the left edge of the
                     master and 1.0 corresponds to the right edge of the master.
                     Location need not be in the range 0.0-1.0.  If both -x and
                     -relx are specified for a slave then their values are
                     summed.  For example, -relx 0.5 -x -2 positions the left
                     edge of the slave 2 pixels to the left of the center of its
                     master.

              -rely location
                     Location specifies the y-coordinate within the master
                     window of the anchor point for window.  In this case the
                     value is specified in a relative fashion as a floating-
                     point number:  0.0 corresponds to the top edge of the
                     master and 1.0 corresponds to the bottom edge of the
                     master.  Location need not be in the range 0.0-1.0.  If
                     both -y and -rely are specified for a slave then their
                     values are summed.  For example, -rely 0.5 -x 3 positions
                     the top edge of the slave 3 pixels below the center of its
                     master.

              -width size
                     Size specifies the width for window in screen units (i.e.
                     any of the forms accepted by Tk_GetPixels).  The width will
                     be the outer width of window including its border, if any.
                     If size is an empty string, or if no -width or -relwidth
                     option is specified, then the width requested internally by
                     the window will be used.

              -x location
                     Location specifies the x-coordinate within the master
                     window of the anchor point for window.  The location is
                     specified in screen units (i.e. any of the forms accepted
                     by Tk_GetPixels) and need not lie within the bounds of the
                     master window.

              -y location
                     Location specifies the y-coordinate within the master
                     window of the anchor point for window.  The location is
                     specified in screen units (i.e. any of the forms accepted
                     by Tk_GetPixels) and need not lie within the bounds of the
                     master window.

              If the same value is specified separately with two different
              options, such as -x and -relx, then the most recent option is used
              and the older one is ignored.

       place forget window
              Causes the placer to stop managing the geometry of window.  As a
              side effect of this command window will be unmapped so that it
              does not appear on the screen.  If window is not currently managed
              by the placer then the command has no effect.  This command
              returns an empty string.

       place info window
              Returns a list giving the current configuration of window.  The
              list consists of option-value pairs in exactly the same form as
              might be specified to the place configure command.

       place slaves window
              Returns a list of all the slave windows for which window is the
              master.  If there are no slaves for window then an empty string is
              returned.

       If the configuration of a window has been retrieved with place info, that
       configuration can be restored later by first using place forget to erase
       any existing information for the window and then invoking place configure
       with the saved information.

FINE POINTS
       It is not necessary for the master window to be the parent of the slave
       window.  This feature is useful in at least two situations.  First, for
       complex window layouts it means you can create a hierarchy of subwindows
       whose only purpose is to assist in the layout of the parent.  The “real
       children” of the parent (i.e. the windows that are significant for the
       application's user interface) can be children of the parent yet be placed
       inside the windows of the geometry-management hierarchy.  This means that
       the path names of the “real children” do not reflect the geometry-
       management hierarchy and users can specify options for the real children
       without being aware of the structure of the geometry-management
       hierarchy.

       A second reason for having a master different than the slave's parent is
       to tie two siblings together.  For example, the placer can be used to
       force a window always to be positioned centered just below one of its
       siblings by specifying the configuration
              -in sibling -relx 0.5 -rely 1.0 -anchor n -bordermode outside
       Whenever the sibling is repositioned in the future, the slave will be
       repositioned as well.

       Unlike many other geometry managers (such as the packer) the placer does
       not make any attempt to manipulate the geometry of the master windows or
       the parents of slave windows (i.e. it does not set their requested
       sizes).  To control the sizes of these windows, make them windows like
       frames and canvases that provide configuration options for this purpose.

EXAMPLE
       Make the label occupy the middle bit of the toplevel, no matter how it is
       resized:
              label .l -text "In the\nMiddle!" -bg black -fg white
              place .l -relwidth .3 -relx .35 -relheight .3 -rely .35
