DESCRIPTION
       This package provides commands for encoding and decoding of strings into
       and out of the standard base32 encoding as specified in RFC 3548.

API
       ::base32::encode string
              This command encodes the given string in base32 and returns the
              encoded string as its result. The result may be padded with the
              character = to signal a partial encoding at the end of the input
              string.

       ::base32::decode estring
              This commands takes the estring and decodes it under the
              assumption that it is a valid base32 encoded string. The result of
              the decoding is returned as the result of the command.

              Note that while the encoder will generate only uppercase
              characters this decoder accepts input in lowercase as well.

              The command will always throw an error whenever encountering
              conditions which signal some type of bogus input, namely if

              [1]    the input contains characters which are not valid output of
                     a base32 encoder,

              [2]    the length of the input is not a multiple of eight,

              [3]    padding appears not at the end of input, but in the middle,

              [4]    the padding has not of length six, four, three, or one
                     characters,

CODE MAP
       The code map used to convert 5-bit sequences is shown below, with the
       numeric id of the bit sequences to the left and the character used to
       encode it to the right. It should be noted that the characters "0" and
       "1" are not used by the encoding. This is done as these characters can be
       easily confused with "O", "o" and "l" (L).
