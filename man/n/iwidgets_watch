DESCRIPTION
       The iwidgets::watch command creates a watch with hour, minute, and second
       hands modifying the time value.


METHODS
       The iwidgets::watch command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
       pathName. This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
       widget. It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command. The
       following commands are possible for watch widgets:


WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              iwidgets::watch command.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for
              information on the format of this list).  If option is specified
              with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one
              named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
              sublist of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one
              or more option-value pairs are specified, then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);
              in this case the command returns an empty string.  Option may have
              any of the values accepted by the iwidgets::watch command.

       pathName get ?format?
              Returns the current time of the watch in a format of string or as
              an integer clock value using the -string and -clicks format
              options respectively.  The default is by string.  Reference the
              clock command for more information on obtaining time and its
              formats.

       pathName show time
              Changes the currently displayed time to be that of the time
              argument.  The time may be specified either as a string, an
              integer clock value or the keyword "now".  Reference the clock
              command for more information on obtaining time and its format.

       pathName watch ?args?
              Evaluates the specifieds args against the canvas component.


COMPONENTS
       Name:           canvas
       Class:          Canvas

              The canvas component is the where the clock is drawn.  See the
              Canvas widget manual entry for details.

       Name:           frame
       Class:          Frame

              The frame component is the where the "AM" and "PM" radiobuttons
              are displayed.  See the Frame widget manual entry for details.

       Name:           am
       Class:          Radiobutton

              The am component indicates whether on not the time is relative to
              "AM".  See the Radiobutton widget manual entry for details.

       Name:           pm
       Class:          Radiobutton

              The pm component indicates whether on not the time is relative to
              "PM".  See the Radiobutton widget manual entry for details.


EXAMPLE

              package require Iwidgets 4.0
              iwidgets::watch .w -state disabled -showampm no -width 155 -height 155
              pack .w -padx 10 -pady 10 -fill both -expand yes

              while {1} {
                after 1000
                .w show
