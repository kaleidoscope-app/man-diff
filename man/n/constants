DESCRIPTION
       This package defines some common mathematical and numerical constants.
       By using the package you get consistent values for numbers like pi and
       ln(10).

       It defines two commands:

       •      One for importing the constants

       •      One for reporting which constants are defined and what values they
              actually have.

       The motivation for this package is that quite often, with (mathematical)
       computations, you need a good approximation to, say, the ratio of degrees
       to radians. You can, of course, define this like:

           variable radtodeg [expr {180.0/(4.0*atan(1.0))}]

       and use the variable radtodeg whenever you need the conversion.

       This has two drawbacks:

       •      You need to remember the proper formula or value and that is
              error-prone.

       •      Especially with the use of mathematical functions like atan you
              assume that they have been accurately implemented. This is seldom
              or never the case and for each platform you can get subtle
              differences.

       Here is the way you can do it with the math::constants package:

           package require math::constants
           ::math::constants::constants radtodeg degtorad

       which creates two variables, radtodeg and (its reciprocal) degtorad in
       the calling namespace.

       Constants that have been defined (their values are mostly taken from
       mathematical tables with more precision than usually can be handled)
       include:

       •      basic constants like pi, e, gamma (Euler's constant)

       •      derived values like ln(10) and sqrt(2)

       •      purely numerical values such as 1/3 that are included for
              convenience and for the fact that certain seemingly trivial
              computations like:

                  set value [expr {3.0*$onethird}]

              give exactly the value you expect (if IEEE arithmetic is
              available).

PROCEDURES
       The package defines the following public procedures:

       ::math::constants::constants args
              Import the constants whose names are given as arguments


       ::math::constants::print-constants args
              Print the constants whose names are given as arguments on the
              screen (name, value and description) or, if no arguments are
              given, print all defined constants. This is mainly a convenience
              procedure.
