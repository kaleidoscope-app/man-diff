DESCRIPTION
       The pie peripheral style labeler object is used as a slice label placer
       for a pie object and is passed to the pie constructor via its -labeler
       option (see the pie class manual).

       The slice description text labels are arranged in 2 columns below the pie
       graphics, whereas the slice values are placed next to the slice and
       actually follow the slice as the pie is updated. Each description label
       text is placed to the right of a rectangle, the background color of which
       matches its corresponding slice. Each description label is actually a
       canvasLabel object.

       There is no need to delete a piePeripheralLabeler object as it is
       automatically handled by the pie class.

       stooop::new piePeripheralLabeler canvas ?options?
              Creates a piePeripheralLabeler object in the specified Tk canvas.
              The piePeripheralLabeler object identifier is returned (refered to
              as piePeripheralLabelerObject in this document).

       switched::configure piePeripheralLabelerObject ?options?
              Configures a piePeripheralLabeler object or returns all the
              options with their current values if no options are passed as
              parameters.

       switched::cget piePeripheralLabelerObject option
              Returns an option value for the specified piePeripheralLabeler
              object.

OPTIONS
       -font value
              Specifies a font for the slice labels. If not specified, the
              default font is system dependent.

       -justify value
              Specifies how to justify labels within their own column. Must be
              one of left, center or right. Defaults to left. For example, if
              justification is right, all column labels right edges are aligned.

       -offset value
              Specifies the distance between the pie graphics and the closest
              slice label. This value may be specified in any of the forms
              described in the canvas COORDINATES manual section.

       -smallfont
              Specifies a font for the slice values. It is usually a small font
              in order to avoid values overlapping when 2 slices are very close
              to each other. If not specified, the description label font (-font
              option) is used.

       -widestvaluetext
              Specifies a string of maximum width for slice values (placed
              around the pie next to the slices), so that enough room is
              allocated for these value labels when the pie width and height are
              set. It defaults to 00.0. For example, it could be set to "00.00
              %".
