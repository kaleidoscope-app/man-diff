DESCRIPTION
       This command allows an application to send Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)
       command when running under Microsoft Windows. Dynamic Data Exchange is a
       mechanism where applications can exchange raw data. Each DDE transaction
       needs a service name and a topic. Both the service name and topic are
       application defined; Tcl uses the service name TclEval, while the topic
       name is the name of the interpreter given by dde servername. Other
       applications have their own service names and topics. For instance,
       Microsoft Excel has the service name Excel.

DDE COMMANDS
       The following commands are a subset of the full Dynamic Data Exchange set
       of commands.

       dde servername ?-force? ?-handler proc? ?--? ?topic?
              dde servername registers the interpreter as a DDE server with the
              service name TclEval and the topic name specified by topic.  If no
              topic is given, dde servername returns the name of the current
              topic or the empty string if it is not registered as a service. If
              the given topic name is already in use, then a suffix of the form
              “ #2” or “ #3” is appended to the name to make it unique. The
              command's result will be the name actually used. The -force option
              is used to force registration of precisely the given topic name.

              The -handler option specifies a Tcl procedure that will be called
              to process calls to the dde server. If the package has been loaded
              into a safe interpreter then a -handler procedure must be defined.
              The procedure is called with all the arguments provided by the
              remote call.

       dde execute ?-async? service topic data
              dde execute takes the data and sends it to the server indicated by
              service with the topic indicated by topic. Typically, service is
              the name of an application, and topic is a file to work on.  The
              data field is given to the remote application.  Typically, the
              application treats the data field as a script, and the script is
              run in the application.  The -async option requests asynchronous
              invocation.  The command returns an error message if the script
              did not run, unless the -async flag was used, in which case the
              command returns immediately with no error.

       dde poke service topic item data
              dde poke passes the data to the server indicated by service using
              the topic and item specified.  Typically, service is the name of
              an application.  topic is application specific but can be a
              command to the server or the name of a file to work on.  The item
              is also application specific and is often not used, but it must
              always be non-null.  The data field is given to the remote
              application.

       dde request ?-binary? service topic item
              dde request is typically used to get the value of something; the
              value of a cell in Microsoft Excel or the text of a selection in
              Microsoft Word. service is typically the name of an application,
              topic is typically the name of the file, and item is application-
              specific. The command returns the value of item as defined in the
              application.  Normally this is interpreted to be a string with
              terminating null.  If -binary is specified, the result is returned
              as a byte array.

       dde services service topic
              dde services returns a list of service-topic pairs that currently
              exist on the machine. If service and topic are both empty strings
              ({}), then all service-topic pairs currently available on the
              system are returned. If service is empty and topic is not, then
              all services with the specified topic are returned. If service is
              non-empty and topic is, all topics for a given service are
              returned. If both are non-empty, if that service-topic pair
              currently exists, it is returned; otherwise, an empty string is
              returned.

       dde eval ?-async? topic cmd ?arg arg ...?
              dde eval evaluates a command and its arguments using the
              interpreter specified by topic. The DDE service must be the
              TclEval service.  The -async option requests asynchronous
              invocation.  The command returns an error message if the script
              did not run, unless the -async flag was used, in which case the
              command returns immediately with no error.  This command can be
              used to replace send on Windows.

DDE AND TCL
       A Tcl interpreter always has a service name of TclEval.  Each different
       interpreter of all running Tcl applications must be given a unique name
       specified by dde servername. Each interp is available as a DDE topic only
       if the dde servername command was used to set the name of the topic for
       each interp. So a dde services TclEval {} command will return a list of
       service-topic pairs, where each of the currently running interps will be
       a topic.

       When Tcl processes a dde execute command, the data for the execute is run
       as a script in the interp named by the topic of the dde execute command.

       When Tcl processes a dde request command, it returns the value of the
       variable given in the dde command in the context of the interp named by
       the dde topic. Tcl reserves the variable $TCLEVAL$EXECUTE$RESULT for
       internal use, and dde request commands for that variable will give
       unpredictable results.

       An external application which wishes to run a script in Tcl should have
       that script store its result in a variable, run the dde execute command,
       and the run dde request to get the value of the variable.

       When using DDE, be careful to ensure that the event queue is flushed
       using either update or vwait.  This happens by default when using wish
       unless a blocking command is called (such as exec without adding the & to
       place the process in the background).  If for any reason the event queue
       is not flushed, DDE commands may hang until the event queue is flushed.
       This can create a deadlock situation.

EXAMPLE
       This asks Internet Explorer (which must already be running) to go to a
       particularly important website:
              package require dde
              dde execute iexplore WWW_OpenURL http://www.tcl.tk/
