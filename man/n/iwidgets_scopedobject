NAME

SYNOPSIS
       scopedobject objName ?options?

INHERITANCE

       Name:     enterscopecommand:
       Command-Line Switch:     -enterscopecommand

              Specifies a Tcl command to invoke when an object enters scope
              (i.e. when it is created..). The default is {}.

       Name:     enterscopecommand:
       Command-Line Switch:     -enterscopecommand

              when it is deleted..). The default is {}.

DESCRIPTION
       The scopedobject command creates a base class for defining Itcl classes
       which posses scoped behavior like Tcl variables.  The objects are only
       accessible within the procedure in which they are instantiated and are
       deleted when the procedure returns.  This class was designed to be a
       general purpose base class for supporting scoped incr Tcl classes.  The
       options include the execute a Tcl script command when an object enters
       and exits its scope.

METHODS
       The scopedobject command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
       pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on the
       object.  It has the following general form:

              pathName option ?arg arg ...?

       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The
       following commands are possible for scopedobject objects:

OBJECT-SPECIFIC METHODS
       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the
              scopedobject command.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the object.  If no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the
              available options for pathName.  If option is specified with no
              value, then the command returns a list describing the one named
              option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist
              of the value returned if no option is specified).  If one or more
              option-value pairs are specified, then the command modifies the
              given objects option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this case
              the command returns an empty string.  Option may have any of the
              values accepted by the scopedobject command.


EXAMPLE
              The scopedobject was primarily meant to be a base class.  The
              following is an example of usage without inheritance:


                proc scopedobject_demo {} {
                  iwidgets::scopedobject #auto         -exitscopecommand {puts "enter scopedobject_demo"}         -exitscopecommand {puts "exit scopedobject_demo"}
                }

                scopedobject_demo
