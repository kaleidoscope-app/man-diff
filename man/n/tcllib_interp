DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a number of commands for the convenient creation of
       Tcl interpreters for highly restricted execution.

API
       ::interp::createEmpty ?path?
              This commands creates an empty Tcl interpreter and returns it
              name. Empty means that the new interpreter has neither namespaces,
              nor any commands. It is useful only for the creation of aliases.

              If a path is specified then it is taken as the name of the new
              interpreter.

       ::interp::snitLink path methodlist
              This command assumes that it was called from within a method of a
              snit object, and that the command mymethod is available.

              It extends the interpreter specified by path with aliases for all
              methods found in the methodlist, with the alias directing
              execution to the same-named method of the snit object invoking
              this command.  Each element of methodlist is actually interpreted
              as a command prefix, with the first word of each prefix the name
              of the method to link to.

              The result of the command is the empty string.

       ::interp::snitDictLink path methoddict
              This command behaves like ::interp::snitLink, except that it takes
              a dictionary mapping from commands to methods as its input, and
              not a list of methods.  Like for ::interp::snitLink the method
              references are actually command prefixes.  This command allows the
              creation of more complex command-method mappings than
              ::interp::snitLink.

              The result of the command is the empty string.
