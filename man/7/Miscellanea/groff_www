NAME
       groff_www - groff macros for authoring web pages

SYNOPSIS
       groff -mwww [ options ] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page describes the GNU -mwww macro package, which is part
       of the groff document formatting system.  The manual  page  is  very  a
       basic  guide,  and the html device driver (grohtml) has been completely
       rewritten but still remains as in an alpha state.  It has been included
       into the distribution so that a lot of people have a chance to test it.
       Note that this macro file will be automatically called (via the troffrc
       file) if you use -Thtml.

       To  see  the hyperlinks in action, please format this man page with the
       grohtml device.

       Here is a summary of the functions found in this macro set.

REQUESTS
       .JOBNAME filename
              Split output into multiple HTML files.  A file is split whenever
              a .SH or .NH 1 is encountered.  Its argument is  the  file  stem
              name  for  future  output  files.   This option is equivalent to
              grohtml's -j option.

       .HX n  Specify the cut off depth when  generating  links  from  section
              headings.   For example, a parameter of 2 would cause grohtml to
              generate a list of links for .NH 1 and .NH 2 but not for  .NH 3.
              Whereas

                     .HX 0

              will  tell  grohtml  that  no heading links should be created at
              all.  Another method for turning automatic headings  off  is  by
              issuing the the command line switch -P-l to groff.

       .BCL foreground background active not-visited visited
              This macro takes five parameters: foreground, background, active
              hypertext link, hypertext link  not  yet  visited,  and  visited
              hypertext link colour.

       .BGIMG imagefile
              the only parameter to this macro is the background image file.

       .URL url [description] [after]
              generates  a  URL using either one, two or three arguments.  The
              first parameter is the actual URL, the second is the name of the
              link,  and the third is optional stuff to be printed immediately
              afterwards.  If description and after are absent  then  the  url
              becomes the anchor text.  Hyphenation is disabled while printing
              the actual URL; explicit breakpoints should be inserted with the
              \: escape.  Here is how to encode foo <http://foo.org/>:

                     .URL http://\:foo.\:org/ foo :

              If  this  is  processed by a device other than -Thtml it appears
              as:

                     foo <http://foo.org>:

              The URL macro can be of any type; for example we can reference
              Eric Raymond's pic guide <pic.html> by:

                     .URL pic.html "Eric Raymond's pic guide"

       .MTO address [description] [after]
              Generate  an email html reference.  The first argument is manda-
              tory as the email address.  The optional second argument is  the
              text  you  see  in  your  browser If an empty argument is given,
              address is used instead.  An optional third  argument  is  stuff
              printed  immediately  afterwards.  Hyphenation is disabled while
              printing the actual email address.  For example,

              Joe User <joe@user.org> was achieved by the following macro:

                     .MTO joe@user.org "Joe User"

              Note that all the URLs actually are treated as consuming no tex-
              tual space in groff.  This could be considered as a bug since it
              causes some problems.  To circumvent this,  www.tmac  inserts  a
              zero-width  character which expands to a harmless space (only if
              run with -Thtml).

       .FTP url [description] [after]
              indicates that data can be obtained via ftp.  The first argument
              is  the  url  and the second is the browser text.  A third argu-
              ment, similar to the macros above, is intended for stuff printed
              immediately  afterwards.  The second and the third parameter are
              optional.  Hyphenation is disabled  while  printing  the  actual
              URL.  As an example, here the location of the GNU ftp server
              <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/>.  The macro example above was specified by:

                     .FTP ftp://\:ftp.gnu.org/ "GNU ftp server" .

       .TAG name
              Generates  an html name tag from its argument.  This can then be
              referenced using the URL <#URL> macro.  As you can see, you must
              precede the tag name with # since it is a local reference.  This
              link was achieved via placing  a  TAG  in  the  URL  description
              above; the source looks like this:

                     .TP
                     .B URL
                     generates
                     .TAG URL
                     a URL using either two or three arguments.
                     ...

       .IMG [-R|-L|-C] filename [width] [height]
              Include  a picture into the document.  The first argument is the
              horizontal location: right, left, or center  (-R,  -L,  or  -C).
              Alignment  is  centered by default (-C).  The second argument is
              the filename.  The optional third and fourth arguments  are  the
              width and height.  If the width is absent it defaults to 1 inch.
              If the height is absent it defaults to  the  width.   This  maps
              onto  an html img tag.  If you are including a png image then it
              is advisable to use the PIMG macro.

       .PIMG [-R|-L|-C] filename [width [height]]
              Include an image in PNG format.  This macro  takes  exactly  the
              same  parameters as the IMG macro; it has the advantage of work-
              ing with postscript and html devices also since it can automati-
              cally convert the image into the EPS format, using the following
              programs of the netpbm package: pngtopnm, pnmcrop, and  pnmtops.
              If  the  document isn't processed with -Thtml it is necessary to
              use the -U option of groff.

       .MPIMG [-R|-L] [-G gap] filename [width [height]]
              Place a PNG image on the margin and wrap text  around  it.   The
              first parameters are optional.  The alignment: left or right (-L
              or -R) specifies the margin where the picture is placed at.  The
              default  alignment is left (-L).  Optionally, -G gap can be used
              to arrange a gap between the picture and  the  text  that  wraps
              around it.  The default gap width is zero.
              The  first  non-optional argument is the filename.  The optional
              following arguments are the width and height.  If the  width  is
              absent  it  defaults  to  1  inch.   If  the height is absent it
              defaults to the width.  Example:

                     .MPIMG -L -G 2c foo.png 3c 1.5c

              The height and width may also be given as percentages. The Post-
              Script  device calculates the width from the .l register and the
              height from the .p register. For example:

                     .MPIMG -L -G 2c foo.png 15%

       .HnS n Begin heading.  The numeric heading level n is specified by  the
              first  parameter.   Use this macro if your headings contain URL,
              FTP or MTO macros.  Example:

                     .HnS 1
                     .HR
                     GNU Troff
                     .URL http://groff.ffii.org (Groff)
                     -- a
                     .URL http://www.gnu.org/ GNU
                     project.
                     Hosted by
                     .URL http://ffii.org/ FFII .
                     .HR
                     .HnE

              In this case you might wish to disable automatic links to  head-
              ings.  This can be done via -P-l from the command line.


       .HnE   End heading.

       .LK    Force grohtml to place the automatically generated links at this
              position.  If this manual page has been  processed  with  -Thtml
              those links can be seen right here.

       .HR    Generate a full-width horizontal rule for -Thtml.  No effect for
              all other devices.

       .NHR   Suppress generation of the top and bottom  rules  which  grohtml
              emits by default.

       .HTL   Generate  an HTML title only.  This differs from the TL macro of
              the ms macro package which generates both an HTML title  and  an
              <H1>  heading.  Use it to provide an HTML title as search engine
              fodder but a graphic title in the document.   The  macro  termi-
              nates when a space or break is seen (.sp, .br).

       .HEAD  Add  arbitrary  HTML  data  to the <head> block.  Ignored if not
              processed with -Thtml.  Example:

                     .HEAD "<link \
                       rel=""icon"" \
                       type=""image/png"" \
                       href=""http://foo.org//bar.png""/>"

       .HTML  All text after this macro is treated as raw html.  If the  docu-
              ment  is  processed  without  -Thtml  then the macro is ignored.
              Internally, this macro is used as a  building  block  for  other
              higher-level macros.

              For example, the BGIMG macro is defined as

                     .de BGIMG
                     .   HTML <body background=\$1>
                     ..

       .DC l text [color]
              Produce a drop capital.  The first parameter is the letter to be
              dropped and enlarged, the second parameter text is the  ajoining
              text  whose  height  the  first  letter  should not exceed.  The
              optional third parameter is the color of the dropped letter.  It
              defaults to black.

       .CDS   Start displaying a code section in constant width font.

       .CDE   End code display

SECTION HEADING LINKS
       By  default  grohtml generates links to all section headings and places
       these at the top of the html document. (See LINKS <#LK> for details  of
       how to switch this off or alter the position).
