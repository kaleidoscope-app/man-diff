NAME
     SmartCardServices – overview of SmartCard support

DESCRIPTION
     SmartCardServices is a set of components for macOS SmartCard support.

     SmartCards which adhere to the PIV standard are supported natively by
     macOS. Additional smartcard support is provided through the installation of
     third party drivers.  Access to SmartCard content is possible using the
     keychain interface.

     SmartCard certificates are automatically added to a user's keychain when a
     SmartCard is inserted and authenticated. SmartCard certificates can be
     listed with the security command using the list-smartcards or
     export-smartcard options. Keychain Access GUI cannot be used to manipulate
     or list these certificates.


     Card Provisioning
              In order to use smartcards with macOS, identities must be
              populated into Slot 9a (PIV Authentication) and 9d (Key
              Managment), and optionally 9c, if signing functions such as e-mail
              signing are to be used.

     Supported Services
              Authentication Login, Screen Saver, ssh, sudo, Safari, PAM
              Authorization, su, Finder

              Authentication is performed using the PIV Authentication Identity
              (9a).  For login, the Key Management key (9d) is used to unlock
              the encrypted harddrive (Apple Silicon devices) and to unlock
              Keychain.

              Encryption and Signing Mail and code signing

              Requires signing certificate.

              Mail in macOS will use Digital Signing and Encryption Identities
              on an attached smartcard.  Signing and Encryption buttons will
              appear in the toolbar when a case-sensitive email address matches
              the subject or subject alternative name on a smartcard's signing
              or encryption certificate.

SETUP
     macOS smart card support can be configured for either fixed key mapping or
     attribute based mapping. To configure fixed keymapping, use sc_auth(8) or
     use the pairing notification dialog which automatically appears when an
     unassociated SmartCard is inserted into a reader. This dialog can be
     globally suppressed by:

           sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.smartcard UserPairing -bool NO

     To configure attribute mapping, use the appropriate AttributeMapping
     section in the configuration file as described below. A configuration file
     is not provided by default. If no AttributeMapping section exists or the
     configuration file is missing, attribute matching is not used. If both
     fixed key mapping and attribute mapping are able to associate the inserted
     SmartCard with a user, attribute mapping takes precedence.

     By default, certificates do not need to be trusted to allow pairing.
     Certificate trust can be globally modified using the checkCertificateTrust
     setting:

           sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.smartcard checkCertificateTrust -int <level>

     Possible trust level values are:

     0   certificate trust check is turned off

     1   certificate trust check is turned on

     2   certificate trust check is turned on and revocation check is set to the
         soft level (If the OCSP/CRL server is unreachable, authentication
         succeeds)

     3   certificate trust check is turned on and revocation check is set to the
         hard level (A verified positive response from the OCSP/CRL server is
         needed to succeed)

CONFIGURATION FILE
     A configuration file for SmartCardServices may be set up using
     /etc/SmartcardLogin.plist and should use a standard plist format. The file
     permissions must be world readable (644) and recommended ownership is root
     or a system administrator.

     It may contain the following optional sections:

     UserSelectorPath
              This string value points to the custom UserSelector process which
              is used for associating users with SmartCards. If this section is
              not found or the component at that path does not exist, the system
              UserSelector is used.

     TrustedAuthorities
              It is possible to specify the Certificate Authorities to be used
              for the trust evaluation of SmartCard certificates. This trust
              works in conjunction with Certificate Trust settings (1, 2, or 3
              required) and is also referred to as Certificate Pinning. Place
              SHA-256 fingerprints of Certificate Authorities (as string values,
              comma delimited, and without spaces) in an array named
              TrustedAuthorities. When Certificate Pinning is used, only
              SmartCard certificates issued by a Certificate Authorities in this
              list will be evaluated as trusted. Please note that
              TrustedAuthorities will be ignored when the checkCertificateTrust
              setting is set to 0 (off).

     AttributeMapping
              This section is used to set up an optional attribute mapping for
              the system UserSelector. For each available user record in
              OpenDirectory, certificate field values are combined into a format
              string which is then compared to a predefined attribute string.
              Specifying multiple OpenDirectory attribute strings or using
              conditional formatting in the format string is not supported. All
              items in this section are mandatory.

              fields contains an array of string values. This is the list of
              certificate field names that will be used to compare against the
              attribute string. The following field names are supported:

              -   Common Name

              -   RFC 822 Name

              -   NT Principal Name

              -   Organization

              -   OrganizationalUnit:1

              -   OrganizationalUnit:2

              -   OrganizationalUnit:3

              -   Country

              formatString contains a string value which specifies how
              certificate fields will be concatenated. Dollar sign plus number
              (starting with 1) is replaced with the field value at the
              appropriate index.

              dsAttributeString contains a string value. This defines the target
              attributes for the desired OpenDirectory user record. It will be
              compared against the generated format strings.

     NotEnforcedGroup
              NotEnforcedGroup contains a string value. This defines the name of
              an Open Directory group that will not be included in mandatory
              smartcard enforcement, when enabled.  This is sometimes referred
              to as User Based Enforcement, and provides per-user granularity to
              SmartcardServices.

              Please see section SMARTCARD ENFORCEMENT for more details.



              In addition, the system must be configured to allow users who are
              not paired with SmartCard to login with password:

                    sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.smartcard allowUnmappedUsers -int 1


              Remember to update the FileVault Login settings using the diskutil
              apfs updatePreboot command.


ATTRIBUTE MAPPING CONFIG EXAMPLE
     Sample configuration (Please note that if copying and pasting the provided
     example, the second line starting with <!DOCTYPE and third line ending with
     .dtd"> should be a single line.  This example presents it as two lines due
     to formatting and will need a line break removed to be a properly formatted
     plist):

     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
     <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
     "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
     <plist version="1.0">
     <dict>
         <key>AttributeMapping</key>
         <dict>
             <key>fields</key>
             <array>
                 <string>Common Name</string>
                 <string>RFC 822 Name</string>
             </array>
             <key>formatString</key>
             <string>$2-$1</string>
             <key>dsAttributeString</key>
             <string>dsAttrTypeNative:longName</string>
         </dict>
     </dict>
     </plist>

     In this example, assume that a certificate has a Common Name with value
     "John Appleseed" and an RFC 822 Name with value "jappleseed@apple.com". The
     formatString "$1-$2" will join both values and the result will be
     jappleseed@apple.com-John Appleseed.  This result will be compared to a
     directory attribute - in this case, the dsAttrTypeNative:email field. When
     a match is found, the corresponding user is considered associated with the
     SmartCard.

OFFLINE SMARTCARD LOGIN VIA KERBEROS CACHING
     In environments where macOS clients may not always be able to reach
     Directory Servers, cached SmartCard login support is possible via Kerberos
     caching. This configuration allows users with network accounts to
     authenticate via SmartCard when operating outside the enterprise
     environment. Note: Initial account setup requires machine binding and
     access to the directory server.

KERBEROS ATTRIBUTE MAPPING CONFIG EXAMPLE
     Sample configuration (Please note that if copying and pasting the provided
     example, the second line starting with <!DOCTYPE and third line ending with
     .dtd"> should be a single line.  This example presents it as two lines due
     to formatting and will need a line break removed to be a properly formatted
     plist).

     The following example SmartcardLogin.plist file matches the Subject
     Alternative Name type, NT Principal Name, in the identity on the SmartCard
     against the Directory Server's altSecurityIdentities field (Kerberos),
     allowing for offline login and authentication:

     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
     <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
     "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
     <plist version="1.0">
     <dict>
         <key>AttributeMapping</key>
         <dict>
             <key>fields</key>
             <array>
                 <string>NT Principal Name</string>
             </array>
             <key>formatString</key>
             <string>Kerberos:$1</string>
             <key>dsAttributeString</key>
             <string>dsAttrTypeStandard:AltSecurityIdentities</string>
         </dict>
     </dict>
     </plist>

   Additional considerations
     Certificate Checking: checkCertificateTrust should not be set to 3 (hard
     revocation check) if certificate revocation or OCSP servers are not always
     available to the client machines.
     User accounts should be created setting the "Create Mobile User on Login"
     flag in the Directory Utility application, when binding client machines via
     the command line, or with a Configuration Profile. When used in conjunction
     with Kerberos Caching, a mobile user account will allow users to
     authenticate either online and offline.

SMARTCARD ENFORCEMENT
     There may be a requirement to use a SmartCard for user authentication in
     your environment. Enforcing the use of the SmartCard for the entire system
     can be done using MDM or a command:

           sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.smartcard enforceSmartCard -bool true

     In addition, the system might be configured to allow users who are not
     paired with SmartCard to login with password using MDM or the command:


           sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.smartcard allowUnmappedUsers -int 1

     Remember to update the FileVault Login settings using the diskutil apfs
     updatePreboot command.

     It is also possible to specify an entire group whose members will be
     exempted from using the card. See the NotEnforcedGroup section above for
     usage. Please note that this option is not compatible with FileVault
     Unlock.

     In addition, it is possible to use the attribute
     kDSNativeAttrTypePrefix:SmartCardEnforcement in the OpenDirectory user
     record. It always refers to that specific user and can take the following
     values:

     0   the system default is respected

     1   card use is always enforced

     2   card enforcement is always disabled, the user can use a password

     If ActiveDirectory is used in your environment, the value of the
     userAccountControl attribute is respected.

   Temporarily disabling card enforcement
     In case the system is configured for SmartCard enforced login and this
     cannot be used, the following command can be used to enable password login
     once:


           security filevault skip-sc-enforcement

     For more details please see the man page of the security command.


   Evaluation order
     The exceptions for enforcement are processed in the following order:

     -   OD kDSNativeAttrTypePrefix:SmartCardEnforcement

     -   AD userAccountControl

     -   NotEnforced group (not available in FileVault Unlock)

     -   AllowUnmappedUsers setting

     -   System-wide setting using defaults or MDM


EXTENSIONS
     Extensions can be created using the Xcode SmartCard Token Extension
     template. Refer to the developer documentation for further details.
     To enable the app extension and make the token available to the system for
     authentication, launch the sc_auth command line tool with value of
     '‘com.apple.ctk.class-id’ from Info.plist:

           sudo sc_auth enable_for_login -t  com.example.HostApp.TokenExtension

SYSTEM REPORT
     It is possible to show the current status of SmartCardServices by command:

           system_profiler SPSmartCardsDataType

     Information presented includes reader, reader driver, card, card driver,
     available smartcards and provisioned certificates.


USB SMART CARD READER DRIVERS
     OS X has built-in support for USB CCID class-compliant SmartCard readers.
     For other readers, install the reader driver in
     /usr/local/libexec/SmartCardServices/drivers.  Each driver is a bundle. The
     bundle contains an XML file Info.plist which contains the device's USB
     vendor ID and product ID. For detailed description of the plist format and
     how to write a reader driver, see
     http://pcsclite.alioth.debian.org/api/group__IFDHandler.html

SMART CARD APDU LOGGING
     It is possible to turn on logging for SmartCards by setting the global
     preference:

           sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.smartcard Logging -bool yes

     After a SmartCard reader is connected (or after reboot) all operations
     including contents of sent and received APDU messages are logged into the
     system log. Logging uses the subsystem com.apple.CryptoTokenKit and
     category APDULog so it is possible to set up logging with a predicate (see
     log(1) ). Example:

           log show --predicate '(subsystem == "com.apple.CryptoTokenKit") && (category == "APDULog")'

     To avoid security and privacy risks that could occur if logging is turned
     on indefinitely, the logging setting is one-shot - it must be turned on by
     the command above to start logging again with a new reader. This includes
     unplugging and replugging the same reader.  If a USB token is used, it is
     treated as both a card and a reader.  Use ssh from a remote system to log
     back in and re-enable logging as needed

DISABLING SMART CARD DRIVERS
     It is possible to turn off token drivers by setting the global preference:

           sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.smartcard DisabledTokens -array com.apple.CryptoTokenKit.pivtoken

     This statement disables built-in PIV SmartCard driver, but it can be used
     to disable any token driver or set of token drivers just by replacing token
     driver extension identifier.

ENTITLEMENT
     Sandboxed PCSC clients require 'com.apple.security.smartcard=YES'
     entitlement. Non-sandboxed PCSC clients do not require such entitlement (in
     order to keep backward compatibility with macOS < 10.10). Users of
     TKSmartCard* API from CryptoTokenKit.framework always require that
     entitlement no matter whether they are sandboxed or not.
