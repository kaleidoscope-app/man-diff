SANDBOX(7)              Miscellaneous Information Manual              SANDBOX(7)

NAME
     sandbox â€“ overview of the sandbox facility

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sandbox.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The sandbox facility allows applications to voluntarily restrict their
     access to operating system resources.  This safety mechanism is intended to
     limit potential damage in the event that a vulnerability is exploited.  It
     is not a replacement for other operating system access controls.

     New processes inherit the sandbox of their parent.  Restrictions are
     generally enforced upon acquisition of operating system resources only.
     For example, if file system writes are restricted, an application will not
     be able to open(2) a file for writing.  However, if the application already
     has a file descriptor opened for writing, it may use that file descriptor
     regardless of restrictions.
