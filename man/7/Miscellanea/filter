DESCRIPTION
       The CUPS filter interface provides a standard method for adding support
       for new document types or printers to CUPS.  Each filter is capable of
       converting from one or more input formats to another format that can
       either be printed directly or piped into another filter to get it to a
       printable format.

       Filters MUST be capable of reading from a filename on the command-line or
       from the standard input, copying the standard input to a temporary file
       as required by the file format.  All output MUST be sent to the standard
       output.  Filters MUST NOT attempt to communicate directly with the
       printer, other processes, or other services.

       The command name (argv[0]) is set to the name of the destination printer
       but is also available in the PRINTER environment variable.

OPTIONS
       Options are passed in argv[5] and are encoded from the corresponding IPP
       attributes used when the job was submitted. Use the cupsParseOptions()
       function to load the options into a cups_option_t array and the
       cupsGetOption() function to get the value of a specific attribute.  Be
       careful to look for common aliases of IPP attributes such as "landscape"
       for the IPP "orientation-requested" attribute.

       Options passed on the command-line typically do not include the default
       choices the printer's PPD file. Use the ppdMarkDefaults() and
       cupsMarkOptions() functions in the CUPS library to apply the options to
       the PPD defaults and map any IPP attributes to the corresponding PPD
       options.  Use ppdFindMarkedChoice() to get the user-selected choice for a
       PPD option. For example, a filter might use the following code to
       determine the current value of the Duplex PPD option:

           ppd_file_t *ppd = ppdOpenFile(getenv("PPD"));
           cups_option_t *options = NULL;
           int num_options = cupsParseOptions(argv[5], 0, &options);

           ppdMarkDefaults(ppd);
           cupsMarkOptions(ppd, num_options, options);

           ppd_choice_t *choice = ppdFindMarkedChoice(ppd, "Duplex");

       Raster filters should use option choices set through the raster page
       header, as those reflect the options in effect for a given page.  Options
       specified on the command-line determine the default values for the entire
       job, which can be overridden on a per-page basis.

LOG MESSAGES
       Messages sent to the standard error are generally stored in the printer's
       "printer-state-message" attribute and the current ErrorLog file.  Each
       line begins with a standard prefix:

       ALERT: message
            Sets the "printer-state-message" attribute and adds the specified
            message to the current ErrorLog using the "alert" log level.

       ATTR: attribute=value [ ... attribute=value]
            Sets the named job or printer attribute(s). The following job
            attributes can be set: "job-media-progress". The following printer
            attributes can be set: "auth-info-required", "marker-colors",
            "marker-high-levels", "marker-levels", "marker-low-levels", "marker-
            message", "marker-names", "marker-types", "printer-alert", and
            "printer-alert-description".

       CRIT: message
            Sets the "printer-state-message" attribute and adds the specified
            message to the current ErrorLog using the "critical" log level.

       DEBUG: message
            Adds the specified message to the current ErrorLog using the "debug"
            log level.  DEBUG messages are never stored in the "printer-state-
            message" attribute.

       DEBUG2: message
            Adds the specified message to the current ErrorLog using the
            "debug2" log level.  DEBUG2 messages are never stored in the
            "printer-state-message" attribute.

       EMERG: message
            Sets the "printer-state-message" attribute and adds the specified
            message to the current ErrorLog using the "emergency" log level.

       ERROR: message
            Sets the "printer-state-message" attribute and adds the specified
            message to the current ErrorLog using the "error" log level.

       INFO: message
            Sets the "printer-state-message" attribute. If the current LogLevel
            is set to "debug2", also adds the specified message to the current
            ErrorLog using the "info" log level.

       NOTICE: message
            Sets the "printer-state-message" attribute and adds the specified
            message to the current ErrorLog using the "notice" log level.

       PAGE: page-number #-copies

       PAGE: total #-pages
            Adds an entry to the current PageLog. The first form adds #-copies
            to the "job-media-sheets-completed" attribute. The second form sets
            the "job-media-sheets-completed" attribute to #-pages.

       PPD: Keyword=Value [ ... KeywordN=Value ]
            Sets the named keywords in the printer's PPD file. This is typically
            used to update default option keywords such as DefaultPageSize and
            the various installable options in the PPD file.

       STATE: printer-state-reason [ ... printer-state-reason ]

       STATE: + printer-state-reason [ ... printer-state-reason ]

       STATE: - printer-state-reason [ ... printer-state-reason ]
            Sets, adds, or removes "printer-state-reason" keywords for the
            current queue. Typically this is used to indicate media, ink, and
            toner conditions on a printer.

       WARNING: message
            Sets the "printer-state-message" attribute and adds the specified
            message to the current ErrorLog using the "warning" log level.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables are defined by the CUPS server when
       executing the filter:

       CHARSET
            The default text character set, typically "utf-8".

       CLASS
            When a job is submitted to a printer class, contains the name of the
            destination printer class. Otherwise this environment variable will
            not be set.

       CONTENT_TYPE
            The MIME media type associated with the submitted job file, for
            example "application/postscript".

       CUPS_CACHEDIR
            The directory where semi-persistent cache files can be found and
            stored.

       CUPS_DATADIR
            The directory where data files can be found.

       CUPS_FILETYPE
            The type of file being printed: "job-sheet" for a banner page and
            "document" for a regular print file.

       CUPS_MAX_MESSAGE
            The maximum size of a message sent to stderr, including any leading
            prefix and the trailing newline.

       CUPS_SERVERROOT
            The root directory of the server.

       FINAL_CONTENT_TYPE
            The MIME media type associated with the output destined for the
            printer, for example "application/vnd.cups-postscript".

       LANG The default language locale (typically C or en).

       PATH The standard execution path for external programs that may be run by
            the filter.

       PPD  The full pathname of the PostScript Printer Description (PPD) file
            for this printer.

       PRINTER
            The name of the printer.

       RIP_CACHE
            The recommended amount of memory to use for Raster Image Processors
            (RIPs).

       SOFTWARE
            The name and version number of the server (typically
            CUPS/major.minor).

       TZ   The timezone of the server.

       USER The user executing the filter, typically "lp" or "root"; consult the
            cups-files.conf file for the current setting.

CONFORMING TO
       While the filter interface is compatible with System V interface scripts,
       CUPS does not support System V interface scripts.

NOTES
       CUPS printer drivers and backends are deprecated and will no longer be
       supported in a future feature release of CUPS.  Printers that do not
       support IPP can be supported using applications such as ippeveprinter(1).

       CUPS filters are not meant to be run directly by the user.  Aside from
       the legacy System V interface issues (argv[0] is the printer name), CUPS
       filters also expect specific environment variables and file descriptors,
       and typically run in a user session that (on macOS) has additional
       restrictions that affect how it runs.  Unless you are a developer and
       know what you are doing, please do not run filters directly.  Instead,
       use the cupsfilter(8) program to use the appropriate filters to do the
       conversions you need.
