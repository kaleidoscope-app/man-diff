NAME
       notifier - cups notification interface

SYNOPSIS
       notifier recipient [ user-data ]

DESCRIPTION
       The CUPS notifier interface provides a standard method for adding support
       for new event notification methods to CUPS.  Each notifier delivers one
       or more IPP events from the standard input to the specified recipient.

       Notifiers MUST read IPP messages from the standard input using the
       ippNew() and ippReadFile() functions and exit on error.  Notifiers are
       encouraged to exit after a suitable period of inactivity, however they
       may exit after reading the first message or stay running until an error
       is seen.  Notifiers inherit the environment and can use the logging
       mechanism documented in filter(7).
