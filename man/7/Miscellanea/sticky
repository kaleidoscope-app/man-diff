STICKY(7)               Miscellaneous Information Manual               STICKY(7)

NAME
     sticky â€“ sticky text and append-only directories

DESCRIPTION
     A special file mode, called the sticky bit (mode S_ISVTX), is used to
     indicate special treatment for directories.  It is ignored for regular
     files.  See chmod(2) or the file <sys/stat.h> for an explanation of file
     modes.

STICKY DIRECTORIES
     A directory whose `sticky bit' is set becomes an append-only directory, or,
     more accurately, a directory in which the deletion of files is restricted.
     A file in a sticky directory may only be removed or renamed by a user if
     the user has write permission for the directory and the user is the owner
     of the file, the owner of the directory, or the super-user.  This feature
     is usefully applied to directories such as /tmp which must be publicly
     writable but should deny users the license to arbitrarily delete or rename
     each others' files.

     Any user may create a sticky directory.  See chmod(1) for details about
     modifying file modes.

HISTORY
     A sticky command appeared in Version 32V AT&T UNIX.

BUGS
     Neither open(2) nor mkdir(2) will create a file with the sticky bit set.
