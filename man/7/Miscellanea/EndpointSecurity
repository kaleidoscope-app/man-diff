NAME
     EndpointSecurity â€“ APIs for applications to implement system security
     policy

DESCRIPTION
     The EndpointSecurity (ES) subsystem is a set of functionality to expose
     security relevant system events to applications (ES clients).  ES clients
     can either be standalone applications/executables or installed as system
     extensions.

     If the ES client is a system extension, the following optional keys can be
     set in the bundle's Info.plist:

     NSEndpointSecurityEarlyBoot
              Type: Boolean

              If set to TRUE, the ES subsystem will hold up all third party
              executions (anything that is not a platform binary) until all
              early boot ES extensions make their first subscription.

     NSEndpointSecurityRebootRequired
              Type: Boolean

              If not set or set to FALSE, the new version of the extension is
              started immediately after terminating the old version.

              If set to TRUE, the new version of the extension is NOT started
              until the system reboots.  When the system reboots, only the new
              version will be started and the old version will be removed.  This
              ensures there is no gap in monitoring of subscribed events.

     NSEndpointSecurityMachServiceName
              Type: String

              If set, this string will be the name of the MachService which can
              be used for XPC between the ES extension and its app.  If not set,
              a default mach service (name: <teamID>.<bundleID>.xpc) will be
              provided but its usage is deprecated.
