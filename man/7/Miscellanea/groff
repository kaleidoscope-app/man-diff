NAME
       groff - a short reference for the GNU roff language

DESCRIPTION
       The  name  groff  stands for GNU roff and is the free implementation of
       the roff type-setting system.  See roff(7) for a survey and  the  back-
       ground of the groff system.

       This document gives only short descriptions of the predefined roff lan-
       guage elements as used in groff.  Both the classical features  and  the
       groff extensions are provided.

       Historically,  the roff language was called troff.  groff is compatible
       with the classical system and provides proper extensions.  So  in  GNU,
       the  terms  roff,  troff, and groff language could be used as synonyms.
       However troff slightly tends to refer more to  the  classical  aspects,
       whereas  groff  emphasizes  the GNU extensions, and roff is the general
       term for the language.

       This file is only a short version of the complete documentation that is
       found  in the groff info(1) file, which contains more detailed, actual,
       and concise information.

       The general syntax for writing groff documents is relatively easy,  but
       writing extensions to the roff language can be a bit harder.

       The roff language is line-oriented.  There are only two kinds of lines,
       control lines and text lines.  The control lines start with  a  control
       character,  by  default  a period "."  or a single quote "'"; all other
       lines are text lines.

       Control lines represent commands, optionally with arguments.  They have
       the following syntax.  The leading control character can be followed by
       a command name; arguments, if any, are separated  by  blanks  from  the
       command name and among themselves, for example,

              .command_name arg1 arg2

       For  indentation, any number of space or tab characters can be inserted
       between the leading control character and the  command  name,  but  the
       control character must be on the first position of the line.

       Text lines represent the parts that will be printed.  They can be modi-
       fied by escape sequences, which are recognized by a  leading  backslash
       `\'.   These  are  in-line or even in-word formatting elements or func-
       tions.  Some of these take arguments separated by  single  quotes  "'",
       others  are regulated by a length encoding introduced by an open paren-
       thesis `(' or enclosed in brackets `[' and `]'.

       The roff language provides flexible instruments  for  writing  language
       extension,  such  as  macros.  When interpreting macro definitions, the
       roff system enters a special operating mode, called the copy mode.

       The copy mode behavior can be quite tricky, but there  are  some  rules
       that ensure a safe usage.

       1.     Printable  backslashes  must  be denoted as \e.  To be more pre-
              cise, \e represents the current  escape  character.   To  get  a
              backslash glyph, use \(rs or \[rs].

       2.     Double all backslashes.

       3.     Begin  all text lines with the special non-spacing character \&.

       This does not produce the most efficient code, but it should work as  a
       first  measure.   For  better  strategies,  see the groff info file and
       groff_tmac(5).

       Reading roff source files is easier, just reduce all double backslashes
       to a single one in all macro definitions.

GROFF ELEMENTS
       The  roff  language elements add formatting information to a text file.
       The fundamental elements are predefined  commands  and  variables  that
       make roff a full-blown programming language.

       There  are  two  kinds  of  roff  commands,  possibly  with  arguments.
       Requests are written on a line of their own starting with a dot `.'  or
       a  "'", whereas Escape sequences are in-line functions and in-word for-
       matting elements starting with a backslash `\'.

       The user can define her own formatting commands using the  de  request.
       These  commands  are  called  macros,  but  they  are used exactly like
       requests.  Macro packages are pre-defined sets of macros written in the
       groff language.  A user's possibilities to create escape sequences her-
       self is very limited, only special characters can be mapped.

       The groff language provides several kinds of variables  with  different
       interfaces.   There  are pre-defined variables, but the user can define
       her own variables as well.

       String variables store character sequences.  They are set with  the  ds
       request  and  retrieved  by  the \* escape sequences.  Strings can have
       variables.

       Register variables can store numerical values,  numbers  with  a  scale
       unit,  and  occasionally string-like objects.  They are set with the nr
       request and retrieved by the \n escape sequences.

       Environments allow the user  to  temporarily  store  global  formatting
       parameters  like line length, font size, etc. for later reuse.  This is
       done by the ev request.

       Fonts are identified either by a name or by an  internal  number.   The
       current font is chosen by the ft request or by the \f escape sequences.
       Each device has special fonts, but the following  fonts  are  available
       for all devices.  R is the standard font Roman.  B is its bold counter-
       part.  The italic font is called I and is available everywhere, but  on
       text  devices  it  is  displayed  as an underlined Roman font.  For the
       graphical output devices, there exist constant-width pendants of  these
       fonts, CR, CI, and CB.  On text devices, all characters have a constant
       width anyway.

       Moreover, there are some advanced roff elements.   A  diversion  stores
       information  into a macro for later usage.  A trap is a positional con-
       dition like a certain number of lines from page top or in  a  diversion
       or in the input.  Some action can be prescribed to be run automatically
       when the condition is met.

       More detailed information and examples can be found in the  groff  info
       file.

CONTROL CHARACTERS
       There is a small set of characters that have a special controlling task
       in certain conditions.

       .      A dot is only special at the beginning of a line  or  after  the
              condition  in  the  requests if, ie, el, and while.  There it is
              the control character that introduces a request (or macro).  The
              special  behavior  can  be  delayed by using the \.  escape.  By
              using the cc request, the control character can be set to a dif-
              ferent character, making the dot `.' a non-special character.

              In  all other positions, it just means a dot character.  In text
              paragraphs, it is advantageous to start each sentence at a  line
              of its own.

       '      The single quote has two controlling tasks.  At the beginning of
              a line and in the conditional requests it  is  the  non-breaking
              control character.  That means that it introduces a request like
              the dot, but with the  additional  property  that  this  request
              doesn't  cause  a  linebreak.  By using the c2 request, the non-
              break control character can be set to a different character.

              As a second task, it is the most commonly used argument  separa-
              tor in some functional escape sequences (but any pair of charac-
              ters not part of the argument will work).  In  all  other  posi-
              tions,  it  denotes  the  single  quote or apostrophe character.
              Groff provides a printable representation with the  \(cq  escape
              sequence.

       "      The  double  quote  is  used  to  enclose arguments in requests,
              macros, and strings.  In the ds and as requests, a leading  dou-
              ble  quote  in  the argument will be stripped off, making every-
              thing else afterwards the string to be defined (enabling leading
              whitespace).   The escaped double quote \" introduces a comment.
              Otherwise, it is not special.  Groff provides a printable repre-
              sentation with the \(dq escape sequence.

       \      The backslash usually introduces an escape sequence (this can be
              changed with the ec request).  A printed version of  the  escape
              character is the \e escape; a backslash glyph can be obtained by
              \(rs.

       (      The open parenthesis is only special in  escape  sequences  when
              introducing an escape name or argument consisting of exactly two
              characters.  In groff, this behavior can be replaced by  the  []
              construct.

       [      The  opening  bracket is only special in groff escape sequences;
              there it is used to introduce a long escape name or long  escape
              argument.  Otherwise, it is non-special, e.g. in macro calls.

       ]      The  closing  bracket is only special in groff escape sequences;
              there it terminates a long escape name or long escape  argument.
              Otherwise, it is non-special.

       space  Space  characters are only functional characters.  They separate
              the arguments in requests, macros, and strings, and the words in
              text lines.  They are subject to groff's horizontal spacing cal-
              culations.  To get a defined space width, escape sequences  like
              `\ ' (this is the escape character followed by a space), \|, \^,
              or \h should be used.

       newline
              In text paragraphs, newlines mostly behave  like  space  charac-
              ters.   Continuation  lines  can be specified by an escaped new-
              line, i.e., by specifying a backslash `\' as the last  character
              of a line.

       tab    If  a  tab  character occurs during text the interpreter makes a
              horizontal jump to the next pre-defined tab position.  There  is
              a sophisticated interface for handling tab positions.

NUMERICAL EXPRESSIONS
       A  numerical  value  is  a  signed or unsigned integer or float with or
       without an appended scaling indicator.  A scaling indicator is  a  one-
       character abbreviation for a unit of measurement.  A number followed by
       a scaling indicator signifies a size value.  By default, numerical val-
       ues do not have a scaling indicator, i.e., they are normal numbers.

       The roff language defines the following scaling indicators.

              c         Centimeter
              i         Inch
              P         Pica = 1/6 inch
              p         Point = 1/72 inch
              m         Em = the font size in points (width of letter `m')
              M         100th of an Em
              n         En = Em/2
              u         Basic unit for actual output device
              v         Vertical    line   space   in   basic   units   scaled
                        point = 1/sizescale of a point (defined in  font  DESC
                        file)
              f         Scale by 65536.

       Numerical  expressions are combinations of the numerical values defined
       above with the following  arithmetical  operators  already  defined  in
       classical troff.

              +         Addition
              -         Subtraction
              *         Multiplication
              /         Division
              %         Modulo
              =         Equals
              ==        Equals
              <         Less than
              >         Greater than
              <=        Less or equal
              >=        Greater or equal
              &         Logical and
              :         Logical or
              !         Logical not
              (         Grouping of expressions
              )         Close current grouping

       Moreover,  groff  added  the  following operators for numerical expres-
       sions:

              e1>?e2    The maximum of e1 and e2.
              e1<?e2    The minimum of e1 and e2.
              (c;e)     Evaluate e using c as the default scaling indicator.

       For details see the groff info file.

CONDITIONS
       Conditions occur in tests raised by the if, ie, and the while requests.
       The following table characterizes the different types of conditions.

              N         A  numerical  expression N yields true if its value is
                        greater than 0.
              !N        True if the value of I is 0.
              's1's2'   True if string s1 is identical to string s2.
              !'s1's2'  True if string s1 is not identical to string s2.
              cch       True if there is a character ch available.
              dname     True if  there  is  a  string,  macro,  diversion,  or
                        request called name.
              e         Current page number is even.
              o         Current page number is odd.
              mname     True if there is a color called name.
              n         Formatter is nroff.
              rreg      True if there is a register named reg.
              t         Formatter is troff.
              Ffont     True if there exists a font named font.
              Sstyle    True if a style named style has been registered.

REQUESTS
       This  section  provides  a short reference for the predefined requests.
       In groff, request and macro names can be arbitrarily long.  No bracket-
       ing or marking of long names is needed.

       Most  requests take one or more arguments.  The arguments are separated
       by space characters (no tabs!); there is no inherent  limit  for  their
       length  or  number.   An  argument  can be enclosed by a pair of double
       quotes.  This is very handy if an argument contains  space  characters,
       e.g., "arg with space" denotes a single argument.

       Some  requests have optional arguments with a different behaviour.  Not
       all of these details are outlined here.  Refer to the groff  info  file
       and groff_diff(7) for all details.

       In  the following request specifications, most argument names were cho-
       sen to be descriptive.  Only the following denotations need  clarifica-
       tion.

              c         denotes a single character.
              font      a  font either specified as a font name or a font num-
                        ber.
              anything  all characters up to the end of the line or within  \{
                        and \}.
              n         is a numerical expression that evaluates to an integer
                        value.
              N         is  an  arbitrary  numerical  expression,  signed   or
                        unsigned.
              +-N       has  three  meanings  depending on its sign, described
                        below.

       If an expression defined as +-N starts with a `+'  sign  the  resulting
       value  of  the  expression  will  be added to an already existing value
       inherent to the related request, e.g. adding to a number register.   If
       the  expression  starts  with a `-' the value of the expression will be
       subtracted from the request value.

       Without a sign, N replaces the existing value directly.   To  assign  a
       negative  number  either  prepend  0  or enclose the negative number in
       parentheses.

ESCAPE SEQUENCES
       Escape sequences are in-line language elements usually introduced by  a
       backslash  `\'  and  followed  by  an  escape  name  and sometimes by a
       required argument.  Input processing is continued  directly  after  the
       escaped  character or the argument resp. without an intervening separa-
       tion character.  So there must be a way to determine  the  end  of  the
       escape name and the end of the argument.

       This  is  done by enclosing names (escape name and arguments consisting
       of a variable name) by a pair of brackets [name] and constant arguments
       (number  expressions  and  characters) by apostrophes (ASCII 0x27) like
       'constant'.

       There are abbreviations for short names.  Two  character  escape  names
       can  be specified by an opening parenthesis like \(xy without a closing
       counterpart.  And all one-character names different  from  the  special
       characters  `['  and  `(' can even be specified without a marker in the
       form \c.

       Constant arguments of length 1 can omit the  marker  apostrophes,  too,
       but there is no two-character analogue.

       While  1-character  escape  sequences are mainly used for in-line func-
       tions and system related tasks, the 2-letter  names  following  the  \(
       construct  are  used for special characters predefined by the roff sys-
       tem.  Escapes sequences with names of more than two characters  \[name]
       denote user defined named characters (see the char request).

   Single Character Escapes
       \"     Beginning of a comment.  Everything up to the end of the line is
              ignored.
       \#     Everything up to and including  the  next  newline  is  ignored.
              This  is  interpreted in copy mode.  This is like \" except that
              the terminating newline is ignored as well.

              name stringvar, taking arg1, arg2, ... as arguments.
       \$0    The  name  by  which  the  current  macro  was invoked.  The als
              request can make a macro have more than one name.

              numerical expression evaluating to an integer >=1.
       \$*    In a macro or string, the concatenation  of  all  the  arguments
              separated by spaces.

              with each surrounded by double quotes, and separated by  spaces.
       \\     reduces  to  a single backslash; useful to delay its interpreta-
              tion as escape character in copy mode.  For  a  printable  back-
              slash,  use \e, or even better \[rs], to be independent from the
              current escape character.

              the  cflags request to be transparent for the purposes of end of
              sentence recognition.
       \/     Increases the width of the preceding character so that the spac-
              ing  between  that character and the following character will be
              correct if the following character is a roman character.
       \,     Modifies the spacing of the  following  character  so  that  the

              when a line is adjusted.
       \:     Inserts  a  zero-width  break point (similar to \% but without a
              soft hyphen character).

       The  escape  sequences \e, \., \", \$, \*, \a, \n, \t, \g, and \newline
       are interpreted in copy mode.

       Escape sequences starting with \( or \[ do not represent single charac-
       ter escape sequences, but introduce escape names with two or more char-
       acters.

       If a backslash is followed by a character that does  not  constitute  a
       defined escape sequence the backslash is silently ignored and the char-
       acter maps to itself.

   Special Characters
       Common special characters are predefined by  escape  sequences  of  the
       form  \(xy  with  characters x and y.  Some of these exist in the usual
       font while most of them are only available in the special font.   Below
       you'll  find  a selection of the most important glyphs; a complete list
       can be found in groff_char(7).

              \(<-   Left arrow
              \(+-   Plus-minus sign

   Strings
       Strings are defined by the ds request and can be retrieved  by  the  \*
       escape sequence.

       Strings  share  their  name  space  with macros.  So strings and macros
       without arguments are roughly equivalent; it  is  possible  to  call  a
       string  like  a  macro  and  vice-versa, but this often leads to unpre-
       dictable results.  The following strings are predefined in groff.

       \*[.T]    The name of the current output device as specified by the  -T
                 command line option.

REGISTERS
       Registers  are  variables that store a value.  In groff, most registers
       store numerical values (see section NUMERICAL EXPRESSIONS  above),  but
       some can also hold a string value.

       Each  register is given a name.  Arbitrary registers can be defined and
       set with the request nr register.

       The value stored in a register can be retrieved by the escape sequences
       introduced by \n.

       Most  useful  are  predefined registers.  In the following the notation
       name is used to refer to a register called register name to make  clear
       that we speak about registers.  Please keep in mind that the \n[] deco-
       ration is not part of the register name.

   Read-only Registers
       The following registers have predefined values that should not be modi-
       fied  by the user (usually, registers starting with a dot a read-only).
       Mostly, they provide information  on  the  current  settings  or  store
       results from request calls.

                 of characters.
       \n[sb]    Depth  of string below base line (generated by width function
                 \w).
       \n[seconds]

                 \w argument.
       \n[slimit]
                 If greater than 0, the maximum number of objects on the input
                 stack.   If  <=0  there is no limit, i.e., recursion can con-
                 tinue until virtual memory is exhausted.
       \n[ssc]   The amount  of  horizontal  space  (possibly  negative)  that
                 should  be  added  to  the  last character before a subscript
                 (generated by width function \w).
       \n[st]    Height of string above base line (generated by width function
                 \w).
       \n[systat]

                 PostScript image (set by .psbb).
       \n[ury]   Upper  right  y-coordinate  (in  PostScript units) of a given
                 PostScript image (set by .psbb).
       \n[year]  The current year (year 2000 compliant).
       \n[yr]    Current year minus 1900.  For  Y2K  compliance  use  register

COMPATIBILITY
       The  differences of the groff language in comparison to classical troff
       as defined by [CSTR #54] are documented in groff_diff(7).

       The groff system provides a compatibility mode, see groff(1) on how  to
       invoke this.

BUGS
       Report bugs to the

       groff  bug mailing list <bug-groff@gnu.org>.  Include a complete, self-
       contained example that will allow the bug to  be  reproduced,  and  say
       which version of groff you are using.
