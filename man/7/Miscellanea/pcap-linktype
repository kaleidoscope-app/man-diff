PCAP-LINKTYPE(7)        Miscellaneous Information Manual        PCAP-LINKTYPE(7)



NAME
       pcap-linktype - link-layer header types supported by libpcap

DESCRIPTION
       For a live capture or ``savefile'', libpcap supplies, as the return value
       of the pcap_datalink(3PCAP) routine, a value that indicates the type of
       link-layer header at the beginning of the packets it provides.  This is
       not necessarily the type of link-layer header that the packets being
       captured have on the network from which they're being captured; for
       example, packets from an IEEE 802.11 network might be provided by libpcap
       with Ethernet headers that the network adapter or the network adapter
       driver generates from the 802.11 headers.  The names for those values
       begin with DLT_, so they are sometimes called "DLT_ values".

       The values stored in the link-layer header type field in the savefile
       header are, in most but not all cases, the same as the values returned by
       pcap_datalink().  The names for those values begin with LINKTYPE_.

       The link-layer header types supported by libpcap are described at
       https://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html.
