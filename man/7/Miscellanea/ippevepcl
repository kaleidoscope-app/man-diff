NAME
       ippevepcl/ps - pcl and postscript print commands for ippeveprinter

SYNOPSIS
       ippevepcl [ filename ]
       ippeveps [ filename ]

DESCRIPTION
       ippevepcl and ippeveps are print commands for ippeveprinter(1).  As with
       all print commands, these commands read either the filename specified on
       the command-line or from the standard input.  Output is sent to the
       standard output.  Status and progress messages are sent to the standard
       error.

       ippevepcl prints to B&W HP PCL laser printers and supports printing of HP
       PCL (application/vnd.hp-pcl), PWG Raster (image/pwg-raster), and Apple
       Raster (image/urf) print files.

       ippeveps print to Adobe PostScript printers and supports printing of PDF
       (application/pdf), PostScript (application/postscript), JPEG
       (image/jpeg), PWG Raster (image/pwg-raster), and Apple Raster (image/urf)
       print files.  Printer-specific commands are read from a supplied PPD
       file.  If no PPD file is specified, generic commands suitable for any
       Level 2 or Level 3 PostScript printer are used instead to specify duplex
       printing and media size.

EXIT STATUS
       These programs return 1 on error and 0 on success.
