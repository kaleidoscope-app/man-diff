FD(4)                         Device Drivers Manual                        FD(4)

NAME
     fd, stdin, stdout, stderr â€“ file descriptor files

DESCRIPTION
     The files /dev/fd/0 through /dev/fd/# refer to file descriptors which can
     be accessed through the file system.  If the file descriptor is open and
     the mode the file is being opened with is a subset of the mode of the
     existing descriptor, the call:

           fd = open("/dev/fd/0", mode);

     and the call:

           fd = fcntl(0, F_DUPFD, 0);

     are equivalent.

     Opening the files /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout and /dev/stderr is equivalent to
     the following calls:

           fd = fcntl(STDIN_FILENO,  F_DUPFD, 0);
           fd = fcntl(STDOUT_FILENO, F_DUPFD, 0);
           fd = fcntl(STDERR_FILENO, F_DUPFD, 0);

     Flags to the open(2) call other than O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY and O_RDWR are
     ignored.
