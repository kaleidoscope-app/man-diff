AUDITPIPE(4)                  Device Drivers Manual                 AUDITPIPE(4)

NAME
     auditpipe – pseudo-device for live audit event tracking

SYNOPSIS
     pseudo-device auditpipe

     #include <security/audit/audit_ioctl.h>

DESCRIPTION
     While audit trail files generated with audit(4) and maintained by auditd(8)
     provide a reliable long-term store for audit log information, current log
     files are owned by the audit daemon until terminated making them somewhat
     unwieldy for live monitoring applications such as host-based intrusion
     detection.  For example, the log may be cycled and new records written to a
     new file without notice to applications that may be accessing the file.

     The audit facility provides an audit pipe facility for applications
     requiring direct access to live BSM audit data for the purposes of real-
     time monitoring.  Audit pipes are available via a clonable special device,
     /dev/auditpipe, subject to the permissions on the device node, and provide
     a "tee" of the audit event stream.  As the device is clonable, more than
     one instance of the device may be opened at a time; each device instance
     will provide independent access to all records.

     The audit pipe device provides discrete BSM audit records; if the read
     buffer passed by the application is too small to hold the next record in
     the sequence, it will be dropped.  Unlike audit data written to the audit
     trail, the reliability of record delivery is not guaranteed.  In
     particular, when an audit pipe queue fills, records will be dropped.  Audit
     pipe devices are blocking by default, but support non-blocking I/O,
     asynchronous I/O using SIGIO, and polled operation via select(2) and
     poll(2).

     Applications may choose to track the global audit trail, or configure local
     preselection parameters independent of the global audit trail parameters.

   Audit Pipe Queue Ioctls
     The following ioctls retrieve and set various audit pipe record queue
     properties:

     AUDITPIPE_GET_QLEN              Query the current number of records
                                     available for reading on the pipe.

     AUDITPIPE_GET_QLIMIT            Retrieve the current maximum number of
                                     records that may be queued for reading on
                                     the pipe.

     AUDITPIPE_SET_QLIMIT            Set the current maximum number of records
                                     that may be queued for reading on the pipe.
                                     The new limit must fall between the queue
                                     limit minimum and queue limit maximum
                                     queryable using the following two ioctls.

     AUDITPIPE_GET_QLIMIT_MIN        Query the lowest possible maximum number of
                                     records that may be queued for reading on
                                     the pipe.

     AUDITPIPE_GET_QLIMIT_MAX        Query the highest possible maximum number
                                     of records that may be queued for reading
                                     on the pipe.

     AUDITPIPE_FLUSH                 Flush all outstanding records on the audit
                                     pipe; useful after setting initial
                                     preselection properties to delete records
                                     queued during the configuration process
                                     which may not match the interests of the
                                     user process.

     AUDITPIPE_GET_MAXAUDITDATA      Query the maximum size of an audit record,
                                     which is a useful minimum size for a user
                                     space buffer intended to hold audit records
                                     read from the audit pipe.

   Audit Pipe Preselection Mode Ioctls
     By default, the audit pipe facility configures pipes to present records
     matched by the system-wide audit trail, configured by auditd(8).  However,
     the preselection mechanism for audit pipes can be configured using
     alternative criteria, including pipe-local flags and naflags settings, as
     well as auid-specific selection masks.  This allows applications to track
     events not captured in the global audit trail, as well as limit records
     presented to those of specific interest to the application.

     The following ioctls configure the preselection mode on an audit pipe:

     AUDITPIPE_GET_PRESELECT_MODE      Return the current preselect mode on the
                                       audit pipe.  The ioctl argument should be
                                       of type int.

     AUDITPIPE_SET_PRESELECT_MODE      Set the current preselection mode on the
                                       audit pipe.  The ioctl argument should be
                                       of type int.

     Possible preselection mode values are:

     AUDITPIPE_PRESELECT_MODE_TRAIL      Use the global audit trail preselection
                                         parameters to select records for the
                                         audit pipe.

     AUDITPIPE_PRESELECT_MODE_LOCAL      Use local audit pipe preselection; this
                                         model is similar to the global audit
                                         trail configuration model, consisting
                                         of global flags and naflags parameters,
                                         as well as a set of per-auid masks.
                                         These parameters are configured using
                                         further ioctls.

     After changing the audit pipe preselection mode, records selected under
     earlier preselection configuration may still be in the audit pipe queue.
     The application may flush the current record queue after changing the
     configuration to remove possibly undesired records.

   Audit Pipe Local Preselection Mode Ioctls
     The following ioctls configure the preselection parameters used when an
     audit pipe is configured for the AUDITPIPE_PRESELECT_MODE_LOCAL
     preselection mode.

     AUDITPIPE_GET_PRESELECT_FLAGS        Retrieve the current default
                                          preselection flags for attributable
                                          events on the pipe.  These flags
                                          correspond to the flags field in
                                          audit_control(5).  The ioctl argument
                                          should be of type au_mask_t.

     AUDITPIPE_SET_PRESELECT_FLAGS        Set the current default preselection
                                          flags for attributable events on the
                                          pipe.  These flags correspond to the
                                          flags field in audit_control(5).  The
                                          ioctl argument should be of type
                                          au_mask_t.

     AUDITPIPE_GET_PRESELECT_NAFLAGS      Retrieve the current default
                                          preselection flags for non-
                                          attributable events on the pipe.
                                          These flags correspond to the naflags
                                          field in audit_control(5).  The ioctl
                                          argument should be of type au_mask_t.

     AUDITPIPE_SET_PRESELECT_NAFLAGS      Set the current default preselection
                                          flags for non-attributable events on
                                          the pipe.  These flags correspond to
                                          the naflags field in audit_control(5).
                                          The ioctl argument should be of type
                                          au_mask_t.

     AUDITPIPE_GET_PRESELECT_AUID         Query the current preselection masks
                                          for a specific auid on the pipe.  The
                                          ioctl argument should be of type
                                          struct auditpipe_ioctl_preselect.  The
                                          auid to query is specified via the
                                          ap_auid field of type au_id_t; the
                                          mask will be returned via ap_mask of
                                          type au_mask_t.

     AUDITPIPE_SET_PRESELECT_AUID         Set the current preselection masks for
                                          a specific auid on the pipe.
                                          Arguments are identical to
                                          AUDITPIPE_GET_PRESELECT_AUID, except
                                          that the caller should properly
                                          initialize the ap_mask field to hold
                                          the desired preselection mask.

     AUDITPIPE_DELETE_PRESELECT_AUID      Delete the current preselection mask
                                          for a specific auid on the pipe.  Once
                                          called, events associated with the
                                          specified auid will use the default
                                          flags mask.  The ioctl argument should
                                          be of type au_id_t.

     AUDITPIPE_FLUSH_PRESELECT_AUID       Delete all auid specific preselection
                                          specifications.

EXAMPLES
     The praudit(1) utility may be directly executed on /dev/auditpipe to review
     the default audit trail.

HISTORY
     The OpenBSM implementation was created by McAfee Research, the security
     division of McAfee Inc., under contract to Apple Computer Inc. in 2004.  It
     was subsequently adopted by the TrustedBSD Project as the foundation for
     the OpenBSM distribution.

     Support for kernel audit first appeared in Mac OS X 10.3 and FreeBSD 6.2.

AUTHORS
     The audit pipe facility was designed and implemented by Robert Watson
     ⟨rwatson@FreeBSD.org⟩.

     The Basic Security Module (BSM) interface to audit records and audit event
     stream format were defined by Sun Microsystems.

BUGS
     See the audit(4) manual page for information on audit-related bugs and
     limitations.

     The configurable preselection mechanism mirrors the selection model present
     for the global audit trail.  It might be desirable to provided a more
     flexible selection model.

     The per-pipe audit event queue is fifo, with drops occurring if either the
     user thread provides in sufficient for the record on the queue head, or on
     enqueue if there is insufficient room.  It might be desirable to allow
     applications to select which records are dropped, possibly in the style of
     preselection.
