NAME
     pflog â€“ packet filter logging interface

SYNOPSIS
     pseudo-device pflog

DESCRIPTION
     The pflog interface is a pseudo-device which makes visible all packets
     logged by the packet filter.  Logged packets can easily be monitored in
     real time by invoking tcpdump(1) on the pflog interface.

     Instances of the pflog interface can be created using ifconfig(8).

EXAMPLES
     Create a pflog interface and monitor all packets logged on it:

           # ifconfig pflog1 create
           # tcpdump -n -e -ttt -i pflog1

SEE ALSO
     inet(4), inet6(4), netintro(4), pf(4), ifconfig(8), tcpdump(1)

HISTORY
     The pflog device first appeared in OpenBSD 3.0.
