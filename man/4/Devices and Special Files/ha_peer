HA_PEER(4)                    Device Drivers Manual                   HA_PEER(4)



NAME
       ha_peer - Xsan HA Peer Server IP Address

SYNOPSIS
       /Library/Preferences/Xsan/ha_peer

DESCRIPTION
       The Xsan File System /Library/Preferences/Xsan/ha_peer file provides the
       IP address of the peer server in an Xsan High Availability (HA) cluster
       configuration to the snhamgr_daemon and fsmpm processes.  It must be
       configured on both servers.  The ha_peer file may also be used to change
       the default IP port (5189) used by the snhamgr_daemon and snhamgr
       processes.

       The ha_peer IP address allows the fsmpm processes to negotiate the
       restarting of HA Timers to avoid unnecessary HA Reset incidents when
       metadata writes are delayed by heavy disk activity, and to detect
       misconfigured /Library/Preferences/Xsan/ha_smith_interval HA Timer
       override values.  For HA clusters with an HaShared file system, the
       address also allows communication between the snhamgr_daemon processes
       running on the metadata controllers to collect operational status for the
       snhamgr command.

SYNTAX
       Any entry that does not begin with # is assumed to be the peer IP address
       and optional port number.  The address should be in IPv4 or IPv6
       numerical format.  The address and port entries are specified as follows:

          <address>
       or

          <address>:<port>

       For IPv6, enclose the address portion in square brackets if also
       specifying a port.

EXAMPLE
       To set the peer address, the ha_peer file would contain the following
       line:

          192.168.10.1

       To set the peer address and port, the ha_peer file would contain the
       following line:

          192.168.10.1:8888

       To set an IPv6 address or address and port, the following lines could be
       specified:

          fe80::250:56ff:fe9b:74b8

       or

          [fe80::250:56ff:fe9b:74b8]:4600
