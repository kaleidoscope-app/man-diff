NAME
       fsports - Xsan File System Port Restrictions

SYNOPSIS
       /Library/Preferences/Xsan/fsports

DESCRIPTION
       The Xsan File System fsports file provides a way to constrain the TCP and
       UDP ports used by core Xsan server processes consisting of the FSMs, the
       FSMPM, and any Distributed LAN servers.  This file can also be used to
       redefine the port used by the Xsan Alternate Portmapper service.  The
       fsports file is usually only necessary when the Xsan control-network
       configuration must pass through a firewall.  Use of the fsports file
       permits firewall pinholing for improved security.  If no fsports file is
       used then port assignment is operating-system dependent.

SYNTAX
       When an fsports file exists in the Xsan 'config' directory, it restricts
       the TCP and UDP port bindings to the user-specified range.  The format of
       the fsports file has two required lines, one optional line, and comments
       starting with pound-sign (#) in column one as follows:
          MinPort value
          MaxPort value
          AltPmap value

       The value fields are port numbers that define an inclusive range of ports
       that the Xsan server processes can use.  Be careful to choose port range
       values that are appropriate for your operating system. Note that the
       Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) suggests a dynamic client port
       range for outgoing connections of 49152 through 65535. With that in mind,
       most Linux kernels use a port range of 32768 through 61000, Microsoft
       Windows operating systems through XP use the range 1025 to 5000 by
       default, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Server 2008 use the IANA range by
       default, and Windows Server 2003 uses the range 1025 to 5000 by default,
       until Microsoft security update MS08-037 from 2008 is installed, after
       which it uses the IANA range by default.

       The optional AltPmap value changes the TCP port used for the Xsan
       Alternate Portmapper service, which defaults to port 5164.  When Xsan is
       used with a firewall, you can either configure the firewall to allow port
       5164 or change the SNFS port number via the AltPmap keyword to a port
       that is allowed to pass through the firewall.

       The AltPmap value must be defined the same way on all Xsan server and
       client nodes in order for Xsan to function properly.  When using AltPmap
       to change the Xsan Alternate Portmapper service port number, you must
       include an fsports file on every Xsan client and server with the same
       AltPmap value.  When the AltPmap keyword is not used, the fsports file is
       not necessary on Xsan clients.

       The minimum number of ports needed on a given node can be computed as
       follows: one port for the FsmPm process, plus one port for each FSM
       process, plus one port for each file system served by this node as a
       Distributed LAN server.

EXAMPLE
       To restrict Xsan Server processes to using ports 52,000 through 52,100
       the fsports file would contain the following lines:
          MinPort 52000
          MaxPort 52100

       This fsports file is only needed on Xsan servers.

       To restrict Xsan Alternate Portmapper service to a specific port, select
       a port number outside the range of the MinPort and MaxPort values.   For
       example if MinPort is 52000 and MaxPort is 52100 then select a value
       outside that range.
          MinPort 52000
          MaxPort 52100
          AltPmap 52101

       This fsports file is required on all Xsan clients and servers.

COMMON FSPORTS COOKBOOK
       The primary use case for fsports is allowing StorNext SAN and LAN clients
       outside of a firewall to access the services provided by StorNext servers
       inside of a firewall.  While other use cases exist, and more complex and
       restrictive configurations are possible, the following "cookbook" steps
       describe how to produce a common fsports file for all servers inside of a
       firewall.  The resultant file provides security without sacrificing ease
       of deployment.

       Step 1.
       Determine the set of servers inside of the firewall that need to be
       accessed.  This may include primary and standby MDCs and Distributed LAN
       servers.

       Step 2.
       For the list of servers from Step 1, determine the maximum number of
       StorNext ports used by any one server.  The following equation can be
       used for this calculation:

         # ports required for a given server = (
             Number of file systems in the "fsmlist" file +
             Number of file systems for which this server is acting as a
             Distributed LAN server +
             1 port for the NSS protocol ) * Multiplier

       where Multiplier is 2 for Windows servers and 1 for non-Windows servers.

       For example, consider the following configuration of servers inside of a
       firewall that need to be accessed by clients outside of the firewall:

         A Linux MDC hosting 4 file systems
             ports: (4 + 0 + 1) * 1  =  5

         A second Linux MDC hosting 6 file systems
             ports: (6 + 0 + 1) * 1  =  7

         A Windows MDC hosting 1 file system and acting as a Distributed LAN
         server for just that file system:
             ports: (1 + 1 + 1) * 2  =  6

         A dedicated Linux Distributed LAN server that serves 9 file systems
         from the various MDC pairs:
             ports: (0 + 9 + 1) * 1  = 10

         The maximum number of StorNext ports needed by any one server is:
             MAX(5, 7, 6, 10) = 10 ports

       Step 3.
       Based on the maximum port count determined in step 2, pick a range of
       unused ports on the firewall and open them up.  For example, for a
       maximum port count of 10, ports 52000 through 52009 could be chosen if
       they are available.  The firewall should be configured to allow outside
       UDP and TCP connections using any source port to connect to StorNext
       servers inside the firewall having the restricted range of ports.  Port
       5164 should also be opened up for TCP for the AltPortMap service.  (See
       NOTES below if this is not possible.)

       Step 4.
       Configure the common fsports file.  Using the example from step 3 of
       where 10 ports are needed starting at 52000.  The configuration is as
       follows:
          MinPort 52000
          MaxPort 52009

       Step 5.
       Install the resulting file on all servers from Step 1.  Also install the
       file on all clients if the AltPmap directive was used.  Then restart
       StorNext.

NOTES
       Servers having common fsports files will use the same range of network
       ports for core StorNext file system services.  This does not result in
       conflicts since each network address is comprised of an IP address and a
       port number and is therefore unique even when using the same port number
       as another network address.

       As mentioned under EXAMPLES, when port 5164 cannot be opened on the
       firewall for the AltPortMap service, it is possible to use the AltPmap
       directive in the fsports file so that a different port is used.  This
       also requires that clients outside of the firewall use an fsports file.

       The fsports file does not constrain the ports used by the client end of
       connections.  Ephemeral ports are used instead.  Therefore, the fsports
       file is only useful on clients when the AltPmap directive is used.

       When using fsports files, if services fail to start or clients fail to
       connect, to debug the problem, try slightly increasing the range of open
       StorNext ports on the firewall and, correspondingly, in the fsports
       files.  Running netstat on the servers may reveal that unexpected
       processes are binding to ports within the range specified in the fsports
       file.  Also, if services are restarted on Windows servers, in some cases
       ports may not be reusable for several minutes.  Using an expanded port
       range will work around this.

       The information above covers the ports used by the core StorNext file
       system services.  If firewall pinholing is needed for other StorNext
       services (for example, replication), additional hard-wired ports may need
       to be opened on the firewall outside of the domain of the fsports file.
       Refer to the "Port Used by StorNext" section in the StorNext File System
       Tuning Guide.

UPDATING FSPORTS CONFIGURATION ON AN HA PAIR
       When changing the fsports configuration on an HA pair and the AltPmap
       directive is used, special care must be taken to avoid having the HA
       mechanism reboot one or both of the HA nodes. Here is the sequence to
       follow:

       Step 1.
       Use the StorNext GUI to enter HA config mode. This locks the secondary
       node and allows configuration changes to be made on the primary node.

       Step 2.
       Stop the cvfs service on the primary node.

       Step 3.
       Stop the cvfs service on the coordinator (name service) nodes.

       Step 4.
       Update, remove or create the fsports file on the coordinator nodes.

       Step 5.
       Start the cvfs service on the coordinator nodes.

       Step 6.
       Update, remove or create the fsports file on both the HA primary and HA
       secondary nodes.

       Step 7.
       Start the cvfs service on the primary node.

       Step 8.
       Use the StorNext GUI to exit HA config mode.

       If not using external coordinators, that is, the HA MDC pair are the
       coordinators for the cluster, eliminate steps 3, 4 and 5.
