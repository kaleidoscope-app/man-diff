DOMAINSID(4)                  Device Drivers Manual                 DOMAINSID(4)



NAME
       domainsid - Xsan File System Domain SID File

SYNOPSIS
       /Library/Preferences/Xsan/domainsid

DESCRIPTION
       The Xsan File System domainsid file is an optional MDC configuration file
       used to set the domain SID to be used with ACLs when the Security Model
       is set to "acl" in a file system configuration file and Unix Identity
       Mapping is set to "algorithmic"

       Note that this file should only be deployed in very specific use cases.
       For example, if an environment uses Open Directory, the domainsid file
       should contain the assigned Domain SID.  This can be determined by
       running the following command on a Mac:

       $ dsmemberutil getsid -U username

       where username is the name of any regular user account in Open Directory.
       This will return a string such as the following:


       S-1-5-21-2553502104-2799725507-638401443-3106

       The Domain SID is the string without the trailing RID so in this example,
       it has the value S-1-5-21-2553502104-2799725507-638401443  The following
       command may be run on the MDC to set this domain SID.

       mdc# echo S-1-5-21-2553502104-2799725507-638401443 > /Library/Preferences/Xsan/domainsid

       After configuring the domainsid, file systems must be restarted on the
       FSM to have it take effect.

       Note: Improper configuration of this file may lead to files having
       invalid ACLs and permissions not being enforced properly.
