SNFS_RAS(4)                   Device Drivers Manual                  SNFS_RAS(4)



NAME
       snfs_ras - Xsan Volume RAS Events

DESCRIPTION
       The Xsan File System supports logging and delivery of specific
       Reliability/Availability/Serviceability (RAS) events.  When a RAS event
       occurs, an entry is added to the event log
       (/System/Library/Filesystems/acfs.fs/Contents/ras/raslog) on the Name
       Server coordinators (see fsnameservers(4)).  It is also possible to
       configure the coordinators to automatically send e-mail for RAS events or
       pass the RAS event to any script or executable as described in the NOTES
       section below.  In an environment that includes the StorNext Management
       Suite (SNMS), RAS events also generate Service Request RAS tickets that
       can be viewed through the SNMS GUI by selecting "System Status" from the
       Service menu.

EVENTS
       The following list contains the currently supported events.

       Event:  SL_EVT_NO_RESPONSE (Not responding)

       Occurs:
              When a reply from the FSM is delayed.

       Example detail:
              client2.foo.com (kernel): Timeout while attempting to force data
              flush for file ´file1´ (inode "895468127") for file system ´snfs1´
              on host client1.  Allowing host client2 to open file. This may
              cause data coherency issues. The data path for host client1 should
              be inspected to confirm that I/O is working correctly.


       Suggested Action(s):
              Confirm that the data path is working properly on the system
              specified in the event detail.

       Event:  SL_EVT_INVALID_LABEL (Label validation failure)

       Occurs:
              When client-side label verification fails.

       Example detail:
              wedge.foo.com (kernel): fs snfs1: disk label verification for
              'CvfsDisk0' failed on rawdev /dev/rhdisk0 blkdev /dev/hdisk0
              (HBA:2 LUN:0)

       Suggested Action(s):
              Check for corrupt, incorrect, or missing labels using the cvlabel
              command.  Also inspect system logs for I/O errors and check SAN
              integrity.

       Event:  SL_EVT_DISK_ALLOC_FAIL (Failed to allocate disk space)

       Occurs:
              When a disk allocation fails due to lack of space.

       Example detail:
              fsm[PID=1234]: fs snfs1: Disk Allocation failed

       Suggested Action(s):
              Free up disk space by removing unnecessary disk copies of files,
              or add disk capacity.

       Event:  SL_EVT_COMM_LUN_FAIL (LUN communication failure)

       Occurs:
              When an I/O error occurs in a multi-path environment, causing a
              path to become disabled.

       Example detail:
              wedge.foo.com (kernel): Disk Path '/dev/rdisk0' (HBA:2 LUN:0) used
              by file system snfs1 temporarily disabled due to I/O error

       Suggested Action(s):
              Check system and RAID logs for SAN integrity.

       Event:  SL_EVT_IO_ERR (I/O Error)

       Occurs:
              When an I/O error is detected by the FSM or a client.

       Example detail:
              wedge.foo.com (kernel): fs snfs1: I/O error on cookie 0x12345678
              cvfs error 'I/O error' (0x3)

       Suggested Action(s):
              Check LUN and disk path health, as well as overall SAN integrity.
              Also inspect the system logs for driver-level I/O errors.

       Event:  SL_EVT_SHUTDOWN_ERR (Error shutting down)

       Occurs:
              When a problem occurs when unmounting or shutting down a file
              system.

       Example detail:
              wedge.foo.com cvadmin[PID=1234]: fs snfs1: could not unmount all
              cvfs file systems

       Suggested Action(s):
              Inspect the file system and system logs to determine the root
              cause.

       Event:  SL_EVT_INITIALIZATION_FAIL (Initialization failure)

       Occurs:
              When the FSM or fsmpm process fails to start up or a mount fails.

       Example detail:
              wedge.foo.com fsm[PID=1880]: fs snfs1: FSM Initialization failed
              with status 0x14 (missing disk(s))

       Suggested Action(s):
              Correct the system configuration as suggested by the event detail,
              or examine the system logs to determine the root cause.  If the
              detail text suggests a problem with starting the fsmpm process,
              run "cvlabel -l" to verify that disk scanning is working properly.

       Event:  SL_EVT_LICENSE_FAIL (License failed)

       Occurs:
              When a Xsan license expires.

       Example detail:
              wedge.foo.com fsm[PID=2588]: fs snfs1: Xsan Client lady.foo.com
              (1372A4B126) license has expired.  All further client operations
              not permitted.

       Suggested Action(s):
              Contact the Apple Technical Assistance Center to obtain a valid
              license.

       Event:  SL_EVT_LICENCE_REQUIRED (License Required)

       Occurs:
              When a Xsan license will expire within 48 hours.
              When a Xsan trial period has expired, or will expire within 7
              days.

       Example detail:
              wedge.foo.com fsm[PID=3325]: fs snfs1: Please update license file!
              Xsan File System license will expire on Tue Dec 12 11:28:26 CST
              2006
              luke.foo.com fsm[PID=4567]: fs snfs2: Trial of StorNext software
              ends in 3 days on Monday May 2 12:13:45 CDT 2022. Please obtain a
              valid product key.
              luke.foo.com fsm[PID=4567]: fs snfs2: Trial of StorNext software
              ended on Monday May 2 12:13:45 CDT 2022. Please obtain a valid
              product key.

       Suggested Action(s):
              Contact the Apple Technical Assistance Center to obtain a valid
              license or product key.

       Event:  SL_EVT_FAIL_OVER (Fail-over has occurred)

       Occurs:
              During during FSM fail-over.

       Example detail:
              wedge.foo.com fsm[PID=3325]: fs snfs1: Fail-over has occurred:
              Previous MDC '172.16.82.71' Current MDC '172.16.82.78'

       Suggested Action(s):
              Inspect the system log and the FSM cvlog to determine the root
              cause.

       Event:  SL_EVT_META_ERR (Metadata error)

       Occurs:
              When the FSM detects a metadata inconsistency.

       Example detail:
              wedge.foo.com fsm[PID=3325]: Invalid inode lookup: 0x345283
              markers 0x3838/0x3838 gen 0x2 next iel 0x337373

       Suggested Action(s):
              Check SAN integrity and inspect the system logs for I/O errors.
              If the SAN is healthy, run cvfsck on the affected file system at
              the earliest convenient opportunity.

       Event:  SL_EVT_BADCFG_NOT_SUP (Configuration not supported)

       Occurs:
              When an FSM configuration file is invalid or missing.  Also occurs
              when the total number of FSMs running on metadata controllers
              under a fsnameservers domain exceeds the capacity limit of the
              heartbeat protocol.

       Example detail:
              wedge.foo.com fsm[PID=3832]: fs snfs1: Problem encountered parsing
              configuration file 'snfs1.cfg': There were no disk types defined

       Example detail:
              wedge.foo.com fsm[PID=3832]: fs snfs1: Problem encountered parsing
              configuration file 'snfs1.cfg': There were no disk types defined

       Suggested Action(s):
              Verify that a valid file system configuration file exists for the
              specified file system.  Also check the system logs for additional
              configuration file error details.  The capacity of the heartbeat
              protocol is a function of the number of FSMs and the length of the
              file-system names.  The maximum number of FSMs can be configured
              by limiting file-system names to seven characters or fewer, and by
              ensuring that all clients are upgraded to use the expanded
              heartbeat-protocol packet size.

       Event:  SL_EVT_TASK_DIED (Process/Task died, not restarted)

       Occurs:
              When the FSM or fsmpm unexpectedly exists.

       Example detail:
              wedge.foo.com fsm[PID=5543]: fs snfs1: PANIC: Alloc_init
              THREAD_MUTEX_INIT alloc_space lock

       Suggested Action(s):
              Check the FSM logs and system logs to determine the root cause.
              If possible, take corrective action.  If you suspect a software
              bug, contact the Apple Technical Assistance Center.

       Event:  SL_EVT_SYS_RES_FAIL (System resource failure)

       Occurs:
              When a memory allocation fails.

       Example detail:
              wedge.foo.com fsm[PID=9939]: Memory allocation of 65536 bytes
              failed: file 'disks.c' line 256

       Suggested Action(s):
              Determine the cause of memory depletion and correct the condition
              by adding memory or paging space to your system.  If SNFS is using
              excessive amounts of memory adjusting the configuration parameters
              might resolve the problem.  For information about adjusting
              parameters, refer to the Release Notes, the snfs_config(5) and
              mount_acfs(8) man pages, and the SNFS Tuning Guide.

       Event:  SL_EVT_SYS_RES_CRIT (System resource critical)

       Occurs:
              When the filesystem is running out of space.

       Example detail:
              wedge.foo.com fsm[PID=3947]: fs 'snfs1': System over 10% full

       Suggested Action(s):
              Add additional storage or reduce file system usage.  If the
              message indicates metadata stripe groups are full, add additional
              metadata storage.

       Event:  SL_EVT_SYS_RES_WARN (System resource warning)

       Occurs:
              When a condition such as a fragmented file is detected.

       Example detail:
              wedge.foo.com fsm[PID=5213]: fs 'snfs1': Excessive fragmentation
              detected in file 'foo'

       Suggested Action(s):
              If fragmentation has been detected, consult the snfsdefrag(1) man-
              page for instructions on performing fragmentation analysis and
              defragmenting files.  Free space defragmentation for the file
              system as a whole may also be performed using the sgdefrag(8)
              utility.

       Event:  SL_EVT_CONNECTION_FAIL (Connection rejected)

       Occurs:
              When the FSM rejects a client connection attempt (other than for a
              licensing issue).

       Example detail:
              wedge.foo.com fsm[PID=9939]: The client node [Node 13] does not
              support cluster-wide central control feature, please upgrade the
              client to a newer version

       Suggested Action(s):
              Check the system logs to determine the root cause.

       Event:  SL_EVT_LUN_CHANGE (LUN mapping changed)

       Occurs:
              When an fsmpm disk scan detects a change in an existing path.

       Example detail:
              wedge.foo.com fsmpm[4872]: Disk 'CvfsDisk0' is no longer
              accessible as '/dev/hdisk0' -- path may have been assigned to
              another device.

       Suggested Action(s):
              If the LUN mapping change is unexpected, run the cvadmin "disks"
              and "paths" commands to confirm that all LUN paths are present.
              Also check SAN integrity and inspect the system logs to determine
              the root cause.

       Event:  SL_EVT_JOURNAL_ERR (Journaling error)

       Occurs:
              When journal recovery fails.

       Example detail:
              wedge.foo.com fsm[5555]: fs snfs1: Journal error: Journal_recover:
              Journal_truncate failed

       Suggested Action(s):
              Contact the Apple technical assistance center and open a service
              request.

NOTES
       To reduce overhead, some types of RAS events are throttled so that only
       one event is generated per hour per system.

       To quickly set up RAS event e-mail notification, use the following steps
       on each of the Name Server coordinators:

       1. copy
       /System/Library/Filesystems/acfs.fs/Contents/examples/rasexec.example to
       /Library/Preferences/Xsan/rasexec

       2. edit /Library/Preferences/Xsan/rasexec and modify RAS_EMAIL as
       appropriate.

       After setting up notification, you may prefer to exclude certain events
       to reduce the number of e-mail messages you receive.  This can be
       accomplished by adding events that you wish to skip to the RAS_EXCLUDE
       variable in /Library/Preferences/Xsan/rasexec.

       To call an arbitrary executable for each RAS event, simply invoke a
       command from /Library/Preferences/Xsan/rasexec.  The first argument
       passed to rasexec is the event (e.g. SL_EVT_IO_ERR) and the second is the
       detail string and these can be passed into your program.  Be careful when
       choosing the command to run so that it does not hang or cause other ill
       effects.
