NAME
     arp – Address Resolution Protocol

SYNOPSIS
     pseudo-device ether

DESCRIPTION
     The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a protocol used to dynamically map
     between Internet host addresses and 10Mb/s Ethernet addresses.  It is used
     by all the 10Mb/s Ethernet interface drivers.  It is not specific to
     Internet protocols or to 10Mb/s Ethernet, but this implementation currently
     supports only that combination.

     ARP caches Internet-Ethernet address mappings.  When an interface requests
     a mapping for an address not in the cache, ARP queues the message which
     requires the mapping and broadcasts a message on the associated network
     requesting the address mapping.  If a response is provided, the new mapping
     is cached and any pending message is transmitted.  ARP will queue at most
     one packet while waiting for a response to a mapping request; only the most
     recently ``transmitted'' packet is kept.  If the target host does not
     respond after several requests, the host is considered to be down for a
     short period (normally 20 seconds), allowing an error to be returned to
     transmission attempts during this interval.  The error is EHOSTDOWN for a
     non-responding destination host, and EHOSTUNREACH for a non-responding
     router.

     The ARP cache is stored in the system routing table as dynamically-created
     host routes.  The route to a directly-attached Ethernet network is
     installed as a “cloning” route (one with the RTF_CLONING flag set), causing
     routes to individual hosts on that network to be created on demand.  These
     routes time out periodically (normally 20 minutes after validated; entries
     are not validated when not in use).  An entry for a host which is not
     responding is a “reject” route (one with the RTF_REJECT flag set).

     ARP entries may be added, deleted or changed with the arp(8) utility.
     Manually-added entries may be temporary or permanent, and may be
     “published”, in which case the system will respond to ARP requests for that
     host as if it were the target of the request.

     In the past, ARP was used to negotiate the use of a trailer encapsulation.
     This is no longer supported.

     ARP watches passively for hosts impersonating the local host (i.e. a host
     which responds to an ARP mapping request for the local host's address).

DIAGNOSTICS
     duplicate IP address %x!! sent from ethernet address: %x:%x:%x:%x:%x:%x.
     ARP has discovered another host on the local network which responds to
     mapping requests for its own Internet address with a different Ethernet
     address, generally indicating that two hosts are attempting to use the same
     Internet address.
