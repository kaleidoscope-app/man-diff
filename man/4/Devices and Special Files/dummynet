DUMMYNET(4)                   Device Drivers Manual                  DUMMYNET(4)

NAME
     dummynet – traffic shaper, bandwidth manager and delay emulator

DESCRIPTION
     dummynet is a system facility that permits the control of traffic going
     through the various network interfaces, by applying bandwidth and queue
     size limitations, implementing different scheduling and queue management
     policies, and emulating delays and losses.

     The user interface for dummynet is implemented by the dnctl program, so the
     reader is referred to the dnctl(8) manpage for a complete description of
     the capabilities of dummynet and on how to use it.

HISTORY
     dummynet was initially implemented as a testing tool for TCP congestion
     control by Luigi Rizzo ⟨luigi@iet.unipi.it⟩, as described on ACM Computer
     Communication Review, Jan.97 issue.  Later it has been then modified to
     work at the ip and bridging level, integrated with the IPFW packet filter,
     and extended to support multiple queueing and scheduling policies.
