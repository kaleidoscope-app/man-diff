AUDIT_EVENT(5)                 File Formats Manual                AUDIT_EVENT(5)

NAME
     audit_event â€“ audit event descriptions

DEPRECATION NOTICE
     The audit(4) subsystem has been deprecated since macOS 11.0, disabled since
     macOS 14.0, and WILL BE REMOVED in a future version of macOS.  Applications
     that require a security event stream should use the EndpointSecurity(7) API
     instead.

     On this version of macOS, you can re-enable audit(4) by renaming or copying
     /etc/security/audit_control.example to /etc/security/audit_control, re-
     enabling the system/com.apple.auditd service by running launchctl enable
     system/com.apple.auditd as root, and rebooting.

DESCRIPTION
     The audit_event file contains descriptions of the auditable events on the
     system.  Each line maps an audit event number to a name, a description, and
     a class.  Entries are of the form:

           eventnum:eventname:description:eventclass

     Each eventclass should have a corresponding entry in the audit_class(5)
     file.

     Example entries in this file are:

           0:AUE_NULL:indir system call:no
           1:AUE_EXIT:exit(2):pc
           2:AUE_FORK:fork(2):pc
           3:AUE_OPEN:open(2):fa

FILES
     /etc/security/audit_event
