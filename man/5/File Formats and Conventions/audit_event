NAME
     audit_event â€“ audit event descriptions

DESCRIPTION (NOW DEPRECATED)
     The audit_event file contains descriptions of the auditable events on the

     a class.  Entries are of the form:

           eventnum:eventname:description:eventclass

     Each eventclass should have a corresponding entry in the audit_class(5)
     file.
