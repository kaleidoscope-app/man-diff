SLAPO-CHAIN(5)                 File Formats Manual                SLAPO-CHAIN(5)



NAME
       slapo-chain - chain overlay to slapd

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The chain overlay to slapd(8) allows automatic referral chasing.  Any
       time a referral is returned (except for bind operations), it is chased by
       using an instance of the ldap backend.  If operations are performed with
       an identity (i.e. after a bind), that identity can be asserted while
       chasing the referrals by means of the identity assertion feature of back-
       ldap (see slapd-ldap(5) for details), which is essentially based on the
       proxied authorization control [RFC 4370].  Referral chasing can be
       controlled by the client by issuing the chaining control (see draft-
       sermersheim-ldap-chaining for details.)


       The config directives that are specific to the chain overlay are prefixed
       by chain-, to avoid potential conflicts with directives specific to the
       underlying database or to other stacked overlays.


       There are very few chain overlay specific directives; however, directives
       related to the instances of the ldap backend that may be implicitly
       instantiated by the overlay may assume a special meaning when used in
       conjunction with this overlay.  They are described in slapd-ldap(5), and
       they also need to be prefixed by chain-.

       Note: this overlay is built into the ldap backend; it is not a separate
       module.


       overlay chain
              This directive adds the chain overlay to the current backend.  The
              chain overlay may be used with any backend, but it is mainly
              intended for use with local storage backends that may return
              referrals.  It is useless in conjunction with the slapd-ldap and
              slapd-meta backends because they already exploit the libldap
              specific referral chase feature.  [Note: this may change in the
              future, as the ldap(5) and meta(5) backends might no longer chase
              referrals on their own.]

       chain-cache-uri {FALSE|true}
              This directive instructs the chain overlay to cache connections to
              URIs parsed out of referrals that are not predefined, to be reused
              for later chaining.  These URIs inherit the properties configured
              for the underlying slapd-ldap(5) before any occurrence of the
              chain-uri directive; basically, they are chained anonymously.

       chain-chaining [resolve=<r>] [continuation=<c>] [critical]
              This directive enables the chaining control (see draft-
              sermersheim-ldap-chaining for details) with the desired resolve
              and continuation behaviors and criticality.  The resolve parameter
              refers to the behavior while discovering a resource, namely when
              accessing the object indicated by the request DN; the continuation
              parameter refers to the behavior while handling intermediate
              responses, which is mostly significant for the search operation,
              but may affect extended operations that return intermediate
              responses.  The values r and c can be any of chainingPreferred,
              chainingRequired, referralsPreferred, referralsRequired.  If the
              critical flag affects the control criticality if provided.  [This
              control is experimental and its support may change in the future.]

       chain-max-depth <n>
              In case a referral is returned during referral chasing, further
              chasing occurs at most <n> levels deep.  Set to 1 (the default) to
              disable further referral chasing.

       chain-return-error {FALSE|true}
              In case referral chasing fails, the real error is returned instead
              of the original referral.  In case multiple referral URIs are
              present, only the first error is returned.  This behavior may not
              be always appropriate nor desirable, since failures in referral
              chasing might be better resolved by the client (e.g. when caused
              by distributed authentication issues).

       chain-uri <ldapuri>
              This directive instantiates a new underlying ldap database and
              instructs it about which URI to contact to chase referrals.  As
              opposed to what stated in slapd-ldap(5), only one URI can appear
              after this directive; all subsequent slapd-ldap(5) directives
              prefixed by chain- refer to this specific instance of a remote
              server.

       Directives for configuring the underlying ldap database may also be
       required, as shown in this example:

              overlay                 chain
              chain-rebind-as-user    FALSE

              chain-uri               "ldap://ldap1.example.com"
              chain-rebind-as-user    TRUE
              chain-idassert-bind     bindmethod="simple"
                                      binddn="cn=Auth,dc=example,dc=com"
                                      credentials="secret"
                                      mode="self"

              chain-uri               "ldap://ldap2.example.com"
              chain-idassert-bind     bindmethod="simple"
                                      binddn="cn=Auth,dc=example,dc=com"
                                      credentials="secret"
                                      mode="none"


       Any valid directives for the ldap database may be used; see slapd-ldap(5)
       for details.  Multiple occurrences of the chain-uri directive may appear,
       to define multiple "trusted" URIs where operations with identity
       assertion are chained.  All URIs not listed in the configuration are
       chained anonymously.  All slapd-ldap(5) directives appearing before the
       first occurrence of chain-uri are inherited by all URIs, unless
       specifically overridden inside each URI configuration.
