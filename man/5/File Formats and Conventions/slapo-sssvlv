NAME
       slapo-sssvlv - Server Side Sorting and Virtual List View overlay to slapd

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       This overlay implements the LDAP Server Side Sorting (RFC2891) control as
       well as the Virtual List View control. It also replaces the default
       implementation of the LDAP PagedResults (RFC2696) control, to ensure that
       it works with Sorting. The overlay can be used with any backend or
       globally for all backends.

       Since a complete result set must be generated in memory before sorting
       can be performed, processing sort requests can have a large impact on the
       server's memory use. As such, any connection is limited to having only a
       limited number of sort requests active at a time. Additional limits may
       be configured as described below.


CONFIGURATION
       These slapd.conf options apply to the SSSVLV overlay.  They should appear
       after the overlay directive.

       sssvlv-max <num>
              Set the maximum number of concurrent sort requests allowed across
              all connections. The default is one half of the number of server
              threads.

       sssvlv-maxkeys <num>
              Set the maximum number of keys allowed in a sort request. The
              default is 5.

       sssvlv-maxperconn <num>
              Set the maximum number of concurrent paged search requests per
              connection. The default is 5. The number of concurrent requests
              remains limited by sssvlv-max.
