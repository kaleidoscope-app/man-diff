NOLOGIN(5)                     File Formats Manual                    NOLOGIN(5)

NAME
     nologin – disallow logins

DESCRIPTION
     Programs such as login(1) disallow logins if the nologin file exists.  The
     programs display the contents of nologin to the user if possible and
     interrupt the login sequence.  This makes it simple to temporarily prevent
     incoming logins systemwide.

     To disable logins on a per-account basis, investigate nologin(8).

SECURITY
     The nologin file is ignored for user root by default.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     The nologin feature is implemented through login.conf(5), which allows to
     change the pathname of the file and to extend the list of users exempt from
     temporary login restriction.

     PAM-aware programs can be selectively configured to respect nologin using
     the pam_nologin(8) module via pam.conf(5).

     The nologin file will be removed at system boot if it resides in /var/run
     and cleanvar_enable is set to “YES” in rc.conf(5), which is default.
     Therefore system reboot can effectively re-enable logins.

FILES
