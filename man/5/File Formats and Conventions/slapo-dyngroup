SLAPO-DYNGROUP(5)              File Formats Manual             SLAPO-DYNGROUP(5)



NAME
       slapo-dyngroup - Dynamic Group overlay to slapd

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The Dynamic Group overlay allows clients to use LDAP Compare operations
       to test the membership of a dynamic group the same way they would check
       against a static group. Compare operations targeting a group's static
       member attribute will be intercepted and tested against the configured
       dynamic group's URL attribute.

       Note that this intercept only happens if the actual Compare operation
       does not return a LDAP_COMPARE_TRUE result. So if a group has both static
       and dynamic members, the static member list will be checked first.

CONFIGURATION
       This slapd.conf option applies to the Dynamic Group overlay.  It should
       appear after the overlay directive.

       attrpair <memberAttr> <URLattr>
              Specify the attributes to be compared. A compare operation on the
              memberAttr will cause the URLattr to be evaluated for the result.

EXAMPLES
         database bdb
         ...
         overlay dyngroup
         attrpair member memberURL
