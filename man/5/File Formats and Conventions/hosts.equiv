HOSTS.EQUIV(5)                 File Formats Manual                HOSTS.EQUIV(5)

NAME
     hosts.equiv, .rhosts â€“ trusted remote hosts and host-user pairs

DESCRIPTION
     The hosts.equiv and .rhosts files list hosts and users which are
     ``trusted'' by the local host when a connection is made via rlogind(8),
     rshd(8), or any other server that uses ruserok(3).  This mechanism bypasses
     password checks, and is required for access via rsh(1).

     Each line of these files has the format:

           hostname [username]

     The hostname may be specified as a host name (typically a fully qualified
     host name in a DNS environment) or address, +@netgroup (from which only the
     host names are checked), or a ``+'' wildcard (allow all hosts).

     The username, if specified, may be given as a user name on the remote host,
     +@netgroup (from which only the user names are checked), or a ``+''
     wildcard (allow all remote users).

     If a username is specified, only that user from the specified host may
     login to the local machine.  If a username is not specified, any user may
     login with the same user name.

EXAMPLES
     somehost
           A common usage:  users on somehost may login to the local host as the
           same user name.
     somehost username
           The user username on somehost may login to the local host.  If
           specified in /etc/hosts.equiv, the user may login with only the same
           user name.
     +@anetgroup username
           The user username may login to the local host from any machine listed
           in the netgroup anetgroup.
     +
     + +
           Two severe security hazards.  In the first case, allows a user on any
           machine to login to the local host as the same user name.  In the
           second case, allows any user on any machine to login to the local
           host (as any user, if in /etc/hosts.equiv).

WARNINGS
     The username checks provided by this mechanism are not secure, as the
     remote user name is received by the server unchecked for validity.
     Therefore this mechanism should only be used in an environment where all
     hosts are completely trusted.

     A numeric host address instead of a host name can help security
     considerations somewhat; the address is then used directly by iruserok(3).

     When a username (or netgroup, or +) is specified in /etc/hosts.equiv, that
     user (or group of users, or all users, respectively) may login to the local
     host as any local user.  Usernames in /etc/hosts.equiv should therefore be
     used with extreme caution, or not at all.

     A .rhosts file must be owned by the user whose home directory it resides
     in, and must be writable only by that user.

     Logins as root only check root's .rhosts file; the /etc/hosts.equiv file is
     not checked for security.  Access permitted through root's .rhosts file is
     typically only for rsh(1), as root must still login on the console for an
     interactive login such as rlogin(1).

HISTORY
     The .rhosts file format appeared in 4.2BSD.

BUGS
     The ruserok(3) implementation currently skips negative entries (preceded
     with a ``-'' sign) and does not treat them as ``short-circuit'' negative
     entries.
