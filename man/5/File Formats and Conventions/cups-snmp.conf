snmp.conf(5)                       Apple Inc.                       snmp.conf(5)



NAME
       snmp.conf - snmp configuration file for cups (deprecated)

DESCRIPTION
       The snmp.conf file configures how the standard CUPS network backends
       (http, https, ipp, ipps, lpd, snmp, and socket) access printer
       information using SNMPv1 and is normally located in the /etc/cups
       directory.  Each line in the file can be a configuration directive, a
       blank line, or a comment. Comment lines start with the # character.

       The Community and DebugLevel directives are used by all backends. The
       remainder apply only to the SNMP backend - cups-snmp(8).

DIRECTIVES
       The following directives are understood by the CUPS network backends:

       Address @IF(name)

       Address @LOCAL

       Address address
            Sends SNMP broadcast queries (for discovery) to the specified
            address(es).  There is no default for the broadcast address.

       Community name
            Specifies the community name to use.  Only a single community name
            may be specified.  The default community name is "public".  If no
            name is specified, all SNMP functions are disabled.

       DebugLevel number
            Specifies the logging level from 0 (none) to 3 (everything).
            Typically only used for debugging (thus the name).  The default
            debug level is 0.

       DeviceURI "regular expression" device-uri [... device-uri]
            Specifies one or more device URIs that should be used for a given
            make and model string.  The regular expression is used to match the
            detected make and model, and the device URI strings must be of the
            form "scheme://%s[:port]/[path]", where "%s" represents the detected
            address or hostname.  There are no default device URI matching
            rules.

       HostNameLookups on

       HostNameLookups off
            Specifies whether the addresses of printers should be converted to
            hostnames or left as numeric IP addresses.  The default is "off".

       MaxRunTime seconds
            Specifies the maximum number of seconds that the SNMP backend will
            scan the network for printers.  The default is 120 seconds (2
            minutes).

NOTES
       CUPS backends are deprecated and will no longer be supported in a future
       feature release of CUPS.  Printers that do not support IPP can be
       supported using applications such as ippeveprinter(1).
