SLAPD-PERL(5)                  File Formats Manual                 SLAPD-PERL(5)



NAME
       slapd-perl - Perl backend to slapd

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The Perl backend to slapd(8) works by embedding a perl(1) interpreter
       into slapd(8).  Any perl database section of the configuration file
       slapd.conf(5) must then specify what Perl module to use.  Slapd then
       creates a new Perl object that handles all the requests for that
       particular instance of the backend.

       You will need to create a method for each one of the following actions:

         * new        # creates a new object,
         * search     # performs the ldap search,
         * compare    # does a compare,
         * modify     # modifies an entry,
         * add        # adds an entry to backend,
         * modrdn     # modifies an entry's rdn,
         * delete     # deletes an ldap entry,
         * config     # process unknown config file lines,
         * init       # called after backend is initialized.

       Unless otherwise specified, the methods return the result code which will
       be returned to the client.  Unimplemented actions can just return
       unwillingToPerform (53).

       new    This method is called when the configuration file encounters a
              perlmod line.  The module in that line is then effectively `use'd
              into the perl interpreter, then the new method is called to create
              a new object.  Note that multiple instances of that object may be
              instantiated, as with any perl object.  The new method receives
              the class name as argument.

       search This method is called when a search request comes from a client.
              It arguments are as follows:
                * object reference
                * base DN
                * scope
                * alias dereferencing policy
                * size limit
                * time limit
                * filter string
                * attributes only flag (1 for yes)
                * list of attributes to return (may be empty)

       Return value: (resultcode, ldif-entry, ldif-entry, ...)

       compare
              This method is called when a compare request comes from a client.
              Its arguments are as follows.
                * object reference
                * dn
                * attribute assertion string

       modify This method is called when a modify request comes from a client.
              Its arguments are as follows.
                * object reference
                * dn
                * a list formatted as follows
                  ({ "ADD" | "DELETE" | "REPLACE" },
                   attributetype, value...)...

       add    This method is called when a add request comes from a client.  Its
              arguments are as follows.
                * object reference
                * entry in string format

       modrdn This method is called when a modrdn request comes from a client.
              Its arguments are as follows.
                * object reference
                * dn
                * new rdn
                * delete old dn flag (1 means yes)

       delete This method is called when a delete request comes from a client.
              Its arguments are as follows.
                * object reference
                * dn

       config This method is called with unknown slapd.conf(5) configuration
              file lines.  Its arguments are as follows.
                * object reference
                * array of arguments on line

       Return value: nonzero if this is not a valid option.

       init   This method is called after backend is initialized.  Its argument
              is as follows.
                * object reference

       Return value: nonzero if initialization failed.

CONFIGURATION
       These slapd.conf options apply to the PERL backend database.  That is,
       they must follow a "database perl" line and come before any subsequent
       "backend" or "database" lines.  Other database options are described in
       the slapd.conf(5) manual page.

       perlModulePath /path/to/libs
              Add the path to the @INC variable.

       perlModule ModName
              `Use' the module name ModName from ModName.pm

       filterSearchResults
              Search results are candidates that need to be filtered (with the
              filter in the search request), rather than search results to be
              returned directly to the client.

EXAMPLE
       There is an example Perl module `SampleLDAP' in the slapd/back-perl/
       directory in the OpenLDAP source tree.

ACCESS CONTROL
       The perl backend does not honor any of the access control semantics
       described in slapd.access(5); all access control is delegated to the
       underlying PERL scripting.  Only read (=r) access to the entry pseudo-
       attribute and to the other attribute values of the entries returned by
       the search operation is honored, which is performed by the frontend.

WARNING
       The interface of this backend to the perl module MAY change.  Any
       suggestions would greatly be appreciated.
