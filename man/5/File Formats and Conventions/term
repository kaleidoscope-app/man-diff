NAME
       term - format of compiled term file.

SYNOPSIS
       term

DESCRIPTION
   STORAGE LOCATION
       Compiled terminfo descriptions are placed under the directory
       /usr/share/terminfo.  Two configurations are supported (when building the
       ncurses libraries):

       directory tree
            A two-level scheme is used to avoid a linear search of a huge UNIX
            system directory: /usr/share/terminfo/c/name where name is the name
            of the terminal, and c is the first character of name.  Thus, act4
            can be found in the file /usr/share/terminfo/a/act4.  Synonyms for
            the same terminal are implemented by multiple links to the same
            compiled file.

       hashed database
            Using Berkeley database, two types of records are stored: the
            terminfo data in the same format as stored in a directory tree with
            the terminfo's primary name as a key, and records containing only
            aliases pointing to the primary name.

            If built to write hashed databases, ncurses can still read terminfo
            databases organized as a directory tree, but cannot write entries
            into the directory tree.  It can write (or rewrite) entries in the
            hashed database.

            ncurses distinguishes the two cases in the TERMINFO and
            TERMINFO_DIRS environment variable by assuming a directory tree for
            entries that correspond to an existing directory, and hashed
            database otherwise.

   STORAGE FORMAT
       The format has been chosen so that it will be the same on all hardware.
       An 8 or more bit byte is assumed, but no assumptions about byte ordering
       or sign extension are made.

       The compiled file is created with the tic program, and read by the
       routine setupterm.  The file is divided into six parts: the header,
       terminal names, boolean flags, numbers, strings, and string table.

       The header section begins the file.  This section contains six short
       integers in the format described below.  These integers are

            (1) the magic number (octal 0432);

            (2) the size, in bytes, of the names section;

            (3) the number of bytes in the boolean section;

            (4) the number of short integers in the numbers section;

            (5) the number of offsets (short integers) in the strings section;

            (6) the size, in bytes, of the string table.

       Short integers are stored in two 8-bit bytes.  The first byte contains
       the least significant 8 bits of the value, and the second byte contains
       the most significant 8 bits.  (Thus, the value represented is
       256*second+first.)  The value -1 is represented by the two bytes 0377,
       0377; other negative values are illegal. This value generally means that
       the corresponding capability is missing from this terminal.  Note that
       this format corresponds to the hardware of the VAX and PDP-11 (that is,
       little-endian machines).  Machines where this does not correspond to the
       hardware must read the integers as two bytes and compute the little-
       endian value.

       The terminal names section comes next.  It contains the first line of the
       terminfo description, listing the various names for the terminal,
       separated by the `|' character.  The section is terminated with an ASCII
       NUL character.

       The boolean flags have one byte for each flag.  This byte is either 0 or
       1 as the flag is present or absent.  The capabilities are in the same
       order as the file <term.h>.

       Between the boolean section and the number section, a null byte will be
       inserted, if necessary, to ensure that the number section begins on an
       even byte (this is a relic of the PDP-11's word-addressed architecture,
       originally designed in to avoid IOT traps induced by addressing a word on
       an odd byte boundary).  All short integers are aligned on a short word
       boundary.

       The numbers section is similar to the flags section.  Each capability
       takes up two bytes, and is stored as a little-endian short integer.  If
       the value represented is -1, the capability is taken to be missing.

       The strings section is also similar.  Each capability is stored as a
       short integer, in the format above.  A value of -1 means the capability
       is missing.  Otherwise, the value is taken as an offset from the
       beginning of the string table.  Special characters in ^X or \c notation
       are stored in their interpreted form, not the printing representation.
       Padding information $<nn> and parameter information %x are stored intact
       in uninterpreted form.

       The final section is the string table.  It contains all the values of
       string capabilities referenced in the string section.  Each string is
       null terminated.

   EXTENDED STORAGE FORMAT
       The previous section describes the conventional terminfo binary format.
       With some minor variations of the offsets (see PORTABILITY), the same
       binary format is used in all modern UNIX systems.  Each system uses a
       predefined set of boolean, number or string capabilities.

       The ncurses libraries and applications support extended terminfo binary
       format, allowing users to define capabilities which are loaded at
       runtime.  This extension is made possible by using the fact that the
       other implementations stop reading the terminfo data when they have
       reached the end of the size given in the header.  ncurses checks the
       size, and if it exceeds that due to the predefined data, continues to
       parse according to its own scheme.

       First, it reads the extended header (5 short integers):

            (1)  count of extended boolean capabilities

            (2)  count of extended numeric capabilities

            (3)  count of extended string capabilities

            (4)  size of the extended string table in bytes.

            (5)  last offset of the extended string table in bytes.

       Using the counts and sizes, ncurses allocates arrays and reads data for
       the extended capabilties in the same order as the header information.

       The extended string table contains values for string capabilities.  After
       the end of these values, it contains the names for each of the extended
       capabilities in order, e.g., booleans, then numbers and finally strings.

PORTABILITY
       Note that it is possible for setupterm to expect a different set of
       capabilities than are actually present in the file.  Either the database
       may have been updated since setupterm has been recompiled (resulting in
       extra unrecognized entries in the file) or the program may have been
       recompiled more recently than the database was updated (resulting in
       missing entries).  The routine setupterm must be prepared for both
       possibilities - this is why the numbers and sizes are included.  Also,
       new capabilities must always be added at the end of the lists of boolean,
       number, and string capabilities.

       Despite the consistent use of little-endian for numbers and the otherwise
       self-describing format, it is not wise to count on portability of binary
       terminfo entries between commercial UNIX versions.  The problem is that
       there are at least three versions of terminfo (under HP-UX, AIX, and
       OSF/1) which diverged from System V terminfo after SVr1, and have added
       extension capabilities to the string table that (in the binary format)
       collide with System V and XSI Curses extensions.  See terminfo(5) for
       detailed discussion of terminfo source compatibility issues.

EXAMPLE
       As an example, here is a hex dump of the description for the Lear-Siegler
       ADM-3, a popular though rather stupid early terminal:

       adm3a|lsi adm3a,
               am,
               cols#80, lines#24,

               cuf1=^L, cup=\E=%p1%{32}%+%c%p2%{32}%+%c, cuu1=^K,
               home=^^, ind=^J,
