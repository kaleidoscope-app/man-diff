AUDIT_CLASS(5)                 File Formats Manual                AUDIT_CLASS(5)

NAME
     audit_class â€“ audit event class descriptions

DEPRECATION NOTICE
     The audit(4) subsystem has been deprecated since macOS 11.0, disabled since
     macOS 14.0, and WILL BE REMOVED in a future version of macOS.  Applications
     that require a security event stream should use the EndpointSecurity(7) API
     instead.

     On this version of macOS, you can re-enable audit(4) by renaming or copying
     /etc/security/audit_control.example to /etc/security/audit_control, re-
     enabling the system/com.apple.auditd service by running launchctl enable
     system/com.apple.auditd as root, and rebooting.

DESCRIPTION
     The audit_class file contains descriptions of the auditable event classes
     on the system.  Each auditable event is a member of an event class.  Each
     line maps an audit event mask (bitmap) to a class and a description.
     Entries are of the form:

           classmask:eventclass:description

     Example entries in this file are:

           0x00000000:no:invalid class
           0x00000001:fr:file read
           0x00000002:fw:file write
           0x00000004:fa:file attribute access
           0x00000080:pc:process
           0x10000000:res:reserved for internal use
           0xffffffff:all:all flags set

NOTES
     The audit class res is reserved for internal use. Unentitled applications
     can still modify the event class preselection mask for an audit event (for
     example by using the audit_event(5) configuration file or the auditon(2)
     system call with the A_SETCLASS command), however these applications will
     not be able to change the res audit class mask for that event.

HISTORY
     The OpenBSM implementation was created by McAfee Research, the security
     division of McAfee Inc., under contract to Apple Computer Inc. in 2004.  It
     was subsequently adopted by the TrustedBSD Project as the foundation for
     the OpenBSM distribution.
