CIDR_TABLE(5)                  File Formats Manual                 CIDR_TABLE(5)




NAME
       cidr_table - format of Postfix CIDR tables

SYNOPSIS
       postmap -q "string" cidr:/etc/postfix/filename

       postmap -q - cidr:/etc/postfix/filename <inputfile

DESCRIPTION
       The Postfix mail system uses optional lookup tables.  These tables are
       usually in dbm or db format.  Alternatively, lookup tables can be
       specified in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) form. In this case,
       each input is compared against a list of patterns. When a match is found,
       the corresponding result is returned and the search is terminated.

       To find out what types of lookup tables your Postfix system supports use
       the "postconf -m" command.

       To test lookup tables, use the "postmap -q" command as described in the
       SYNOPSIS above.

TABLE FORMAT
       The general form of a Postfix CIDR table is:

       pattern     result
              When a search string matches the specified pattern, use the
              corresponding result value. The pattern must be in network/prefix
              or network_address form (see ADDRESS PATTERN SYNTAX below).

       !pattern     result
              When a search string does not match the specified pattern, use the
              specified result value. The pattern must be in network/prefix or
              network_address form (see ADDRESS PATTERN SYNTAX below).

              This feature is available in Postfix 3.2 and later.

       if pattern

       endif  When a search string matches the specified pattern, match that
              search string against the patterns between if and endif.  The
              pattern must be in network/prefix or network_address form (see
              ADDRESS PATTERN SYNTAX below). The if..endif can nest.

              Note: do not prepend whitespace to text between if..endif.

              This feature is available in Postfix 3.2 and later.

       if !pattern

       endif  When a search string does not match the specified pattern, match
              that search string against the patterns between if and endif. The
              pattern must be in network/prefix or network_address form (see
              ADDRESS PATTERN SYNTAX below). The if..endif can nest.

              Note: do not prepend whitespace to text between if..endif.

              This feature is available in Postfix 3.2 and later.

       blank lines and comments
              Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored, as are lines
              whose first non-whitespace character is a `#'.

       multi-line text
              A logical line starts with non-whitespace text. A line that starts
              with whitespace continues a logical line.

TABLE SEARCH ORDER
       Patterns are applied in the order as specified in the table, until a
       pattern is found that matches the search string.

ADDRESS PATTERN SYNTAX
       Postfix CIDR tables are pattern-based. A pattern is either a
       network_address which requires an exact match, or a
       network_address/prefix_length where the prefix_length part specifies the
       length of the network_address prefix that must be matched (the other bits
       in the network_address part must be zero).

       An IPv4 network address is a sequence of four decimal octets separated by
       ".", and an IPv6 network address is a sequence of three to eight
       hexadecimal octet pairs separated by ":" or "::", where the latter is
       short-hand for a sequence of one or more all-zero octet pairs. The
       pattern 0.0.0.0/0 matches every IPv4 address, and ::/0 matches every IPv6
       address.  IPv6 support is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

       Before comparisons are made, lookup keys and table entries are converted
       from string to binary. Therefore, IPv6 patterns will be matched
       regardless of leading zeros (a leading zero in an IPv4 address octet
       indicates octal notation).

       Note: address information may be enclosed inside "[]" but this form is
       not required.

EXAMPLE SMTPD ACCESS MAP
       /etc/postfix/main.cf:
           smtpd_client_restrictions = ... cidr:/etc/postfix/client.cidr ...

       /etc/postfix/client.cidr:
           # Rule order matters. Put more specific whitelist entries
           # before more general blacklist entries.
           192.168.1.1             OK
           192.168.0.0/16          REJECT
           2001:db8::1             OK
           2001:db8::/32           REJECT
