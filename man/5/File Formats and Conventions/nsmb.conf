NAME
     nsmb.conf – configuration file for SMB requests

DESCRIPTION
     The nsmb.conf file contains information about the computers and shares or
     mount points for the SMB network protocol.

     The configuration hierarchy is made up of several sections, each section
     containing a few or several lines of parameters and their assigned values.
     Each of these sections must begin with a section name enclosed within
     square brackets, similar to:

           [section_name]

     The end of each section is marked by either the start of a new section, or
     by the abrupt ending of the file, commonly referred to as the EOF.  Each
     section may contain zero or more parameters such as:

           [section_name]
           key=value

     where key represents a parameter name, and value would be the parameter's
     assigned value.

     The SMB library uses the following information for section names:

     A)      [default]
     B)      [SERVER]
     C)      [SERVER:SHARE]

     Possible keywords may include:

     The minimum authentication level can be one of:

     kerberos      Kerberos - NTLMv2, NTLM, LM, and plain-text password
                   authentication are not attempted.

     ntlmv2        NTLMv2 - Kerberos authentication is attempted if a Kerberos
                   token can be obtained, otherwise NTLMv2 authentication is
                   attempted; if the server doesn't support encrypted passwords,
                   the authentication fails.

     ntlm          NTLM - Kerberos authentication is attempted if a Kerberos
                   token can be obtained, otherwise NTLMv2 authentication is
                   attempted and, if that fails, NTLMv1 authentication is
                   attempted, with zeroes in the LM hash; if the server doesn't
                   support encrypted passwords, the authentication fails.

     lm            LM - Kerberos authentication is attempted if a Kerberos token
                   can be obtained, otherwise NTLMv2 authentication is attempted
                   and, if that fails, NTLMv1 authentication is attempted,
                   including the LM hash; if the server doesn't support
                   encrypted passwords, the authentication fails.

     none          none - The same as lm except that, if the server doesn't
                   support encrypted passwords, plain-text passwords are used.
                   Required for servers that don't support extended security.

     (Note: "NetBIOS" as used below means "NetBIOS over TCP/IP.")

     "How to use SMB TCP/UDP ports" can be one of:

     both              Attempt to connect via port 445. If that is unsuccessful,
                       try to connect via NetBIOS.

     netbios_only      Do not attempt to connect via port 445.

     no_netbios        Attempt to connect via port 445. If that is unsuccessful,
                       do not try to connect via NetBIOS.

     "Bitmap of SMB Versions that are enabled" can be one of:

     7 == 0111
            SMB 1/2/3 should be enabled

     6 == 0110
            SMB 2/3 should be enabled

     4 == 0100
            SMB 3 should be enabled

     "Bitmap of SMB Versions that have signing required" can be one of:

     7      Signing required for SMB 1/2/3.

     6      Signing required for SMB 2/3.

     4      Signing required for SMB 3.

     "Bitmap of SMB 3.1.1 encryption algorithms that are enabled" can be one of:

     15 == 1111
            AES-256-GCM/AES-256-CCM/AES-128-GCM/AES-128-CCM should be enabled

     7 == 0111
            AES-256-CCM/AES-128-GCM/AES-128-CCM should be enabled

     3 == 0011
            AES-128-GCM/AES-128-CCM should be enabled

     1 == 0001
            AES-128-CCM should be enabled

FILES
     /etc/nsmb.conf      The global configuration file.

     ~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf
                         The user's configuration file, conflicts will be
                         overwritten by the global file.

EXAMPLES
     What follows is a sample configuration file which may, or may not match
     your environment:

           # Configuration file for example.com
           [default]
           minauth=ntlmv2
           streams=yes
           soft=yes
           notify_off=yes
           [WINXP]
           addr=windowsXP.apple.com

     All lines which begin with the ‘#’ character are comments and will not be
     parsed.  The “default” section specifies that only Kerberos and NTLMv2
     authentication should be attempted; NTLM authentication should not be
     attempted if NTLMv2 authentication fails, and plain-text authentication
     should not be attempted if the server doesn't support encrypted passwords.
