NAME
       mime.convs - mime type conversion file for cups (deprecated)

DESCRIPTION
       The mime.convs file defines the filters that are available for converting
       files from one format to another.  The standard filters support text,
       PDF, PostScript, and many types of image files.

       Additional filters are specified in files with the extension .convs in
       the CUPS configuration directory.

       Each line in the mime.convs file is a comment, blank, or filter line.
       Comment lines start with the # character.  Filter lines specify the
       source and destination MIME types along with a relative cost associated
       with the filter and the filter to run:

           source/type destination/type cost filter

       The source/type field specifies the source MIME media type that is
       consumed by the filter.

       The destination/type field specifies the destination MIME media type that
       is produced by the filter.

       The cost field specifies the relative cost for running the filter.  A
       value of 100 means that the filter uses a large amount of resources while
       a value of 0 means that the filter uses very few resources.

       The filter field specifies the filter program filename.  Filenames are
       relative to the CUPS filter directory.

FILES
       /etc/cups - Typical CUPS configuration directory.
       /usr/lib/cups/filter - Typical CUPS filter directory.
       /usr/libexec/cups/filter - CUPS filter directory on macOS.

EXAMPLES
       Define a filter that converts PostScript documents to CUPS Raster format:

           application/vnd.cups-postscript application/vnd.cups-raster 50 pstoraster


NOTES
       CUPS filters are deprecated and will no longer be supported in a future
       feature release of CUPS.  Printers that do not support IPP can be
       supported using applications such as ippeveprinter(1).
