SERVICES(5)                    File Formats Manual                   SERVICES(5)

NAME
     services â€“ service name data base

DESCRIPTION
     The services file contains information regarding the known services
     available in the DARPA Internet.  For each service a single line should be
     present with the following information:

           official service name
           port number
           protocol name
           aliases

     Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters.  The
     port number and protocol name are considered a single item; a ``/'' is used
     to separate the port and protocol (e.g. ``512/tcp'').  A ``#'' indicates
     the beginning of a comment; subsequent characters up to the end of the line
     are not interpreted by the routines which search the file.

     Service names may contain any printable character other than a field
     delimiter, newline, or comment character.

INTERACTION WITH DIRECTORY SERVICES
     Processes generally find service records using one of the getservent(3)
     family of functions, or using getaddrinfo(3).  On Mac OS X, these functions
     interact with the DirectoryService(8) daemon, which reads the /etc/services
     file as well as searching other directory information services to determine
     service name, protocol, and port information.

FILES
     /etc/services

SEE ALSO
     getservent(3), getaddrinfo(3), DirectoryService(8)

HISTORY
     The services file format appeared in 4.2BSD.
