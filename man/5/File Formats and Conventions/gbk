SYNOPSIS
     ENCODING "GBK"

DESCRIPTION
     GBK is a backwards-compatible extension of the GB 2312-1980 encoding method
     for Chinese text, which adds the characters defined in the Unified Han
     portion of the Unicode 2.1 standard.

     Multibyte characters in the GBK encoding can be one byte or two bytes long.

     range 0x00 to 0x7F.  Chinese characters are represented by two bytes,
     beginning with a byte in the range 0x80-0xFE and ending with a byte in the
     range 0x40-0xFE.
