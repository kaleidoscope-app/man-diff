SLAPO-REFINT(5)                File Formats Manual               SLAPO-REFINT(5)



NAME
       slapo-refint - Referential Integrity overlay to slapd

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The Referential Integrity overlay can be used with a backend database
       such as slapd-bdb(5) to maintain the cohesiveness of a schema which
       utilizes reference attributes.

       Integrity is maintained by updating database records which contain the
       named attributes to match the results of a modrdn or delete operation.
       For example, if the integrity attribute were configured as manager,
       deletion of the record "uid=robert,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" would
       trigger a search for all other records which have a manager attribute
       containing that DN. Entries matching that search would have their manager
       attribute removed.  Or, renaming the same record into
       "uid=george,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" would trigger a search for all
       other records which have a manager attribute containing that DN.  Entries
       matching that search would have their manager attribute deleted and
       replaced by the new DN.

       rootdn must be set for the database.  refint runs as the rootdn to gain
       access to make its updates.  rootpw is not needed.

CONFIGURATION
       These slapd.conf options apply to the Referential Integrity overlay.
       They should appear after the overlay directive.

       refint_attributes <attribute> [...]
              Specify one or more attributes for which integrity will be
              maintained as described above.

       refint_nothing <string>
              Specify an arbitrary value to be used as a placeholder when the
              last value would otherwise be deleted from an attribute. This can
              be useful in cases where the schema requires the existence of an
              attribute for which referential integrity is enforced. The
              attempted deletion of a required attribute will otherwise result
              in an Object Class Violation, causing the request to fail.  The
              string must be a valid DN.

       refint_modifiersname <DN>
              Specify the DN to be used as the modifiersName of the internal
              modifications performed by the overlay.  It defaults to
              "cn=Referential Integrity Overlay".
