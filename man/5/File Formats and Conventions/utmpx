UTMPX(5)                       File Formats Manual                      UTMPX(5)

NAME
     utmpx – user accounting database

SYNOPSIS
     #include <utmpx.h>

DESCRIPTION
     In contrast to utmp and wtmp, the extended databases in utmpx and wtmpx
     reserve more space for logging hostnames, and also information on a
     process' ID, termination signal and exit status.

     The ⟨utmpx.h⟩ header defines the structures and functions for logging user.
     Currently logged in users are tracked in /var/run/utmpx.  The interface to
     the utmpx file is described in endutxent(3).  The file is not automatically
     created if they do not exist; it must be created manually.

     Traditionally, separate files would be used to store the running log of the
     logins and logouts (wtmpx), and the last login of each user (lastlogx).
     With the availability of the Apple system log facility asl(3), these
     separate files can be replace with log entries, which are automatically
     generated when utmpx entries are written.  The API to access the logins and
     logouts is described in endutxent_wtmp(3) while the last login info is
     accessible with getlastlogx(3).

     For compatibility, changes to utmpx are reflected in utmp(3) (in the utmp,
     wtmp and lastlog files), but not the other way around.

FILES
     /var/run/utmpx  The utmpx file.
