FINGER.CONF(5)                 File Formats Manual                FINGER.CONF(5)

NAME
     finger.conf â€“ finger(1) alias configuration file

DESCRIPTION
     The optional finger.conf file is used to provide aliases that can be
     fingered by local and network users.  This may be useful where a user's
     login name is not the same as their preferred mail address, or for
     providing virtual login names than can be fingered.

     Lines beginning with ``#'' are comments.  Other lines must consist of an
     alias name and a target name separated by a colon.  A target name should be
     either a user, a forward reference to another alias or the path of a world
     readable file.

     Where an alias points to a file, the contents of that file will be
     displayed when the alias is fingered.
