UTMP(5)                        File Formats Manual                       UTMP(5)

NAME
     utmp, wtmp, lastlog – login records (DEPRECATED)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <utmp.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The interfaces in file ⟨utmp.h⟩ are all DEPRECATED and are only provided
     for compatibility with previous releases of Mac OS X.  See pututxline(3)
     and utmpx(5) for the supported interfaces.

     ⟨utmp.h⟩ declares the structures used to record information about current
     users in the file utmp, logins and logouts in the file wtmp, and last
     logins in the file lastlog.  The time stamps of date changes, shutdowns and
     reboots are also logged in the wtmp file.

     These files can grow rapidly on busy systems, daily or weekly rotation is
     recommended.  If any of these files do not exist, it is not created.  These
     files must be created manually and are normally maintained in either the
     script /etc/daily or the script /etc/weekly.  (See cron(8).)

           #define _PATH_UTMP      "/var/run/utmp"
           #define _PATH_WTMP      "/var/log/wtmp"
           #define _PATH_LASTLOG   "/var/log/lastlog"

           #define UT_NAMESIZE     8
           #define UT_LINESIZE     8
           #define UT_HOSTSIZE     16

           struct lastlog {
                   time_t  ll_time;
                   char    ll_line[UT_LINESIZE];
                   char    ll_host[UT_HOSTSIZE];
           };

           struct utmp {
                   char    ut_line[UT_LINESIZE];
                   char    ut_name[UT_NAMESIZE];
                   char    ut_host[UT_HOSTSIZE];
                   time_t  ut_time;
           };

     Each time a user logs in, the login program looks up the user's UID in the
     file lastlog. If it is found, the timestamp of the last time the user
     logged in, the terminal line and the hostname are written to the standard
     output. (Providing the login is not quiet, see login(1).) The login program
     then records the new login time in the file lastlog.

     After the new lastlog record is written , the file utmp is opened and the
     utmp record for the user inserted.  This record remains there until the
     user logs out at which time it is deleted.  The utmp file is used by the
     programs rwho(1), users(1), w(1), and who(1).

     Next, the login program opens the file wtmp, and appends the user's utmp
     record.  The same utmp record, with an updated time stamp is later appended
     to the file when the user logs out. (See launchd(8).) The wtmp file is used
     by the programs last(1) and ac(8).

     In the event of a date change, a shutdown or reboot, the following items
     are logged in the wtmp file.

     reboot
     shutdown    A system reboot or shutdown has been initiated.  The character
                 ‘~’ is placed in the field ut_line, and reboot or shutdown in
                 the field ut_name.  (See shutdown(8) and reboot(8).)

     date        The system time has been manually or automatically updated.
                 (See date(1).) The command name date is recorded in the field
                 ut_name.  In the field ut_line, the character ‘|’ indicates the
                 time prior to the change, and the character ‘{’ indicates the
                 new time.
