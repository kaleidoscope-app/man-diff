SLAPD-CONFIG(5)                File Formats Manual               SLAPD-CONFIG(5)



NAME
       slapd-config - configuration backend to slapd

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openldap/slapd.d

DESCRIPTION
       The config backend manages all of the configuration information for the
       slapd(8) daemon.  This configuration information is also used by the
       SLAPD tools slapacl(8), slapadd(8), slapauth(8), slapcat(8), slapdn(8),
       slapindex(8), and slaptest(8).

       The config backend is backward compatible with the older slapd.conf(5)
       file but provides the ability to change the configuration dynamically at
       runtime. If slapd is run with only a slapd.conf file dynamic changes will
       be allowed but they will not persist across a server restart. Dynamic
       changes are only saved when slapd is running from a slapd.d configuration
       directory.

       Unlike other backends, there can only be one instance of the config
       backend, and most of its structure is predefined. The root of the
       database is hardcoded to cn=config and this root entry contains global
       settings for slapd. Multiple child entries underneath the root entry are
       used to carry various other settings:

              cn=Module
                     dynamically loaded modules

              cn=Schema
                     schema definitions

              olcBackend=xxx
                     backend-specific settings

              olcDatabase=xxx
                     database-specific settings

       The cn=Module entries will only appear in configurations where slapd was
       built with support for dynamically loaded modules. There can be multiple
       entries, one for each configured module path. Within each entry there
       will be values recorded for each module loaded on a given path. These
       entries have no children.

       The cn=Schema entry contains all of the hardcoded schema elements.  The
       children of this entry contain all user-defined schema elements.  In
       schema that were loaded from include files, the child entry will be named
       after the include file from which the schema was loaded.  Typically the
       first child in this subtree will be cn=core,cn=schema,cn=config.

       olcBackend entries are for storing settings specific to a single backend
       type (and thus global to all database instances of that type).  At
       present there are no backends that implement settings of this nature, so
       usually there will not be any olcBackend entries.

       olcDatabase entries store settings specific to a single database
       instance. These entries may have olcOverlay child entries corresponding
       to any overlays configured on the database. The olcDatabase and
       olcOverlay entries may also have miscellaneous child entries for other
       settings as needed. There are two special database entries that are
       predefined - one is an entry for the config database itself, and the
       other is for the "frontend" database. Settings in the frontend database
       are inherited by the other databases, unless they are explicitly
       overridden in a specific database.

       The specific configuration options available are discussed below in the
       Global Configuration Options, General Backend Options, and General
       Database Options. Options are set by defining LDAP attributes with
       specific values.  In general the names of the LDAP attributes are the
       same as the corresponding slapd.conf keyword, with an "olc" prefix added
       on.

       The parser for many of these attributes is the same as used for parsing
       the slapd.conf keywords. As such, slapd.conf keywords that allow multiple
       items to be specified on one line, separated by whitespace, will allow
       multiple items to be specified in one attribute value. However, when
       reading the attribute via LDAP, the items will be returned as individual
       attribute values.

       Backend-specific options are discussed in the slapd-<backend>(5) manual
       pages.  Refer to the "OpenLDAP Administrator's Guide" for more details on
       configuring slapd.

GLOBAL CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       Options described in this section apply to the server as a whole.
       Arguments that should be replaced by actual text are shown in brackets
       <>.

       These options may only be specified in the cn=config entry. This entry
       must have an objectClass of olcGlobal.


       olcAllows: <features>
              Specify a set of features to allow (default none).  bind_v2 allows
              acceptance of LDAPv2 bind requests.  Note that slapd(8) does not
              truly implement LDAPv2 (RFC 1777), now Historic (RFC 3494).
              bind_anon_cred allows anonymous bind when credentials are not
              empty (e.g.  when DN is empty).  bind_anon_dn allows
              unauthenticated (anonymous) bind when DN is not empty.
              update_anon allows unauthenticated (anonymous) update operations
              to be processed (subject to access controls and other
              administrative limits).  proxy_authz_anon allows unauthenticated
              (anonymous) proxy authorization control to be processed (subject
              to access controls, authorization and other administrative
              limits).

       olcArgsFile: <filename>
              The (absolute) name of a file that will hold the slapd server's
              command line (program name and options).

       olcAttributeOptions: <option-name>...
              Define tagging attribute options or option tag/range prefixes.
              Options must not end with `-', prefixes must end with `-'.  The
              `lang-' prefix is predefined.  If you use the olcAttributeOptions
              directive, `lang-' will no longer be defined and you must specify
              it explicitly if you want it defined.

              An attribute description with a tagging option is a subtype of
              that attribute description without the option.  Except for that,
              options defined this way have no special semantics.  Prefixes
              defined this way work like the `lang-' options: They define a
              prefix for tagging options starting with the prefix.  That is, if
              you define the prefix `x-foo-', you can use the option
              `x-foo-bar'.  Furthermore, in a search or compare, a prefix or
              range name (with a trailing `-') matches all options starting with
              that name, as well as the option with the range name sans the
              trailing `-'.  That is, `x-foo-bar-' matches `x-foo-bar' and
              `x-foo-bar-baz'.

              RFC 4520 reserves options beginning with `x-' for private
              experiments.  Other options should be registered with IANA, see
              RFC 4520 section 3.5.  OpenLDAP also has the `binary' option built
              in, but this is a transfer option, not a tagging option.

       olcAuthIDRewrite: <rewrite-rule>
              Used by the authentication framework to convert simple user names
              to an LDAP DN used for authorization purposes.  Its purpose is
              analogous to that of olcAuthzRegexp (see below).  The rewrite-rule
              is a set of rules analogous to those described in slapo-rwm(5) for
              data rewriting (after stripping the rwm- prefix).
              olcAuthIDRewrite and olcAuthzRegexp should not be intermixed.

       olcAuthzPolicy: <policy>
              Used to specify which rules to use for Proxy Authorization.  Proxy
              authorization allows a client to authenticate to the server using
              one user's credentials, but specify a different identity to use
              for authorization and access control purposes. It essentially
              allows user A to login as user B, using user A's password.  The
              none flag disables proxy authorization. This is the default
              setting.  The from flag will use rules in the authzFrom attribute
              of the authorization DN.  The to flag will use rules in the
              authzTo attribute of the authentication DN.  The any flag, an
              alias for the deprecated value of both, will allow any of the
              above, whatever succeeds first (checked in to, from sequence.  The
              all flag requires both authorizations to succeed.

              The rules are mechanisms to specify which identities are allowed
              to perform proxy authorization.  The authzFrom attribute in an
              entry specifies which other users are allowed to proxy login to
              this entry. The authzTo attribute in an entry specifies which
              other users this user can authorize as.  Use of authzTo rules can
              be easily abused if users are allowed to write arbitrary values to
              this attribute.  In general the authzTo attribute must be
              protected with ACLs such that only privileged users can modify it.
              The value of authzFrom and authzTo describes an identity or a set
              of identities; it can take five forms:

                     ldap:///<base>??[<scope>]?<filter>
                     dn[.<dnstyle>]:<pattern>
                     u[<mech>[<realm>]]:<pattern>
                     group[/objectClass[/attributeType]]:<pattern>
                     <pattern>

                     <dnstyle>:={exact|onelevel|children|subtree|regex}

              The first form is a valid LDAP URI where the <host>:<port>, the
              <attrs> and the <extensions> portions must be absent, so that the
              search occurs locally on either authzFrom or authzTo.  The second
              form is a DN, with the optional style modifiers exact, onelevel,
              children, and subtree for exact, onelevel, children and subtree
              matches, which cause <pattern> to be normalized according to the
              DN normalization rules, or the special regex style, which causes
              the <pattern> to be treated as a POSIX (''extended'') regular
              expression, as discussed in regex(7) and/or re_format(7).  A
              pattern of * means any non-anonymous DN.  The third form is a SASL
              id, with the optional fields <mech> and <realm> that allow to
              specify a SASL mechanism, and eventually a SASL realm, for those
              mechanisms that support one.  The need to allow the specification
              of a mechanism is still debated, and users are strongly
              discouraged to rely on this possibility.  The fourth form is a
              group specification, consisting of the keyword group, optionally
              followed by the specification of the group objectClass and member
              attributeType.  The group with DN <pattern> is searched with base
              scope, and in case of match, the values of the member
              attributeType are searched for the asserted DN.  For backwards
              compatibility, if no identity type is provided, i.e. only
              <pattern> is present, an exact DN is assumed; as a consequence,
              <pattern> is subjected to DN normalization.  Since the
              interpretation of authzFrom and authzTo can impact security, users
              are strongly encouraged to explicitly set the type of identity
              specification that is being used.  A subset of these rules can be
              used as third arg in the olcAuthzRegexp statement (see below);
              significantly, the URI and the dn.exact:<dn> forms.

       olcAuthzRegexp: <match> <replace>
              Used by the authentication framework to convert simple user names,
              such as provided by SASL subsystem, to an LDAP DN used for
              authorization purposes.  Note that the resultant DN need not refer
              to an existing entry to be considered valid.  When an
              authorization request is received from the SASL subsystem, the
              SASL USERNAME, REALM, and MECHANISM are taken, when available, and
              combined into a name of the form

                     UID=<username>[[,CN=<realm>],CN=<mechanism>],CN=auth

              This name is then compared against the match POSIX (''extended'')
              regular expression, and if the match is successful, the name is
              replaced with the replace string.  If there are wildcard strings
              in the match regular expression that are enclosed in parenthesis,
              e.g.

                     UID=([^,]*),CN=.*

              then the portion of the name that matched the wildcard will be
              stored in the numbered placeholder variable $1. If there are other
              wildcard strings in parenthesis, the matching strings will be in
              $2, $3, etc. up to $9. The placeholders can then be used in the
              replace string, e.g.

                     UID=$1,OU=Accounts,DC=example,DC=com

              The replaced name can be either a DN, i.e. a string prefixed by
              "dn:", or an LDAP URI.  If the latter, the server will use the URI
              to search its own database(s) and, if the search returns exactly
              one entry, the name is replaced by the DN of that entry.   The
              LDAP URI must have no hostport, attrs, or extensions components,
              but the filter is mandatory, e.g.

                     ldap:///OU=Accounts,DC=example,DC=com??one?(UID=$1)

              The protocol portion of the URI must be strictly ldap.  Note that
              this search is subject to access controls.  Specifically, the
              authentication identity must have "auth" access in the subject.

              Multiple olcAuthzRegexp values can be specified to allow for
              multiple matching and replacement patterns. The matching patterns
              are checked in the order they appear in the attribute, stopping at
              the first successful match.


       olcConcurrency: <integer>
              Specify a desired level of concurrency.  Provided to the
              underlying thread system as a hint.  The default is not to provide
              any hint. This setting is only meaningful on some platforms where
              there is not a one to one correspondence between user threads and
              kernel threads.

       olcConnMaxPending: <integer>
              Specify the maximum number of pending requests for an anonymous
              session.  If requests are submitted faster than the server can
              process them, they will be queued up to this limit. If the limit
              is exceeded, the session is closed. The default is 100.

       olcConnMaxPendingAuth: <integer>
              Specify the maximum number of pending requests for an
              authenticated session.  The default is 1000.

       olcDisallows: <features>
              Specify a set of features to disallow (default none).  bind_anon
              disables acceptance of anonymous bind requests.  Note that this
              setting does not prohibit anonymous directory access (See "require
              authc").  bind_simple disables simple (bind) authentication.
              tls_2_anon disables forcing session to anonymous status (see also
              tls_authc) upon StartTLS operation receipt.  tls_authc disallows
              the StartTLS operation if authenticated (see also tls_2_anon).

       olcExtraAttrs: <attr>
              Lists what attributes need to be added to search requests.  Local
              storage backends return the entire entry to the frontend.  The
              frontend takes care of only returning the requested attributes
              that are allowed by ACLs.  However, features like access checking
              and so may need specific attributes that are not automatically
              returned by remote storage backends, like proxy backends and so
              on.  <attr> is an attribute that is needed for internal purposes
              and thus always needs to be collected, even when not explicitly
              requested by clients.  This attribute is multi-valued.

       olcGentleHUP: { TRUE | FALSE }
              A SIGHUP signal will only cause a 'gentle' shutdown-attempt: Slapd
              will stop listening for new connections, but will not close the
              connections to the current clients.  Future write operations
              return unwilling-to-perform, though.  Slapd terminates when all
              clients have closed their connections (if they ever do), or - as
              before - if it receives a SIGTERM signal.  This can be useful if
              you wish to terminate the server and start a new slapd server with
              another database, without disrupting the currently active clients.
              The default is FALSE.  You may wish to use olcIdleTimeout along
              with this option.

       olcIdleTimeout: <integer>
              Specify the number of seconds to wait before forcibly closing an
              idle client connection.  A setting of 0 disables this feature.
              The default is 0. You may also want to set the olcWriteTimeout
              option.

       olcIndexIntLen: <integer>
              Specify the key length for ordered integer indices. The most
              significant bytes of the binary integer will be used for index
              keys. The default value is 4, which provides exact indexing for 31
              bit values.  A floating point representation is used to index too
              large values.

       olcIndexSubstrIfMaxlen: <integer>
              Specify the maximum length for subinitial and subfinal indices.
              Only this many characters of an attribute value will be processed
              by the indexing functions; any excess characters are ignored. The
              default is 4.

       olcIndexSubstrIfMinlen: <integer>
              Specify the minimum length for subinitial and subfinal indices. An
              attribute value must have at least this many characters in order
              to be processed by the indexing functions. The default is 2.

       olcIndexSubstrAnyLen: <integer>
              Specify the length used for subany indices. An attribute value
              must have at least this many characters in order to be processed.
              Attribute values longer than this length will be processed in
              segments of this length. The default is 4. The subany index will
              also be used in subinitial and subfinal index lookups when the
              filter string is longer than the olcIndexSubstrIfMaxlen value.

       olcIndexSubstrAnyStep: <integer>
              Specify the steps used in subany index lookups. This value sets
              the offset for the segments of a filter string that are processed
              for a subany index lookup. The default is 2. For example, with the
              default values, a search using this filter "cn=*abcdefgh*" would
              generate index lookups for "abcd", "cdef", and "efgh".


       Note: Indexing support depends on the particular backend in use. Also,
       changing these settings will generally require deleting any indices that
       depend on these parameters and recreating them with slapindex(8).


       olcListenerThreads: <integer>
              Specify the number of threads to use for the connection manager.
              The default is 1 and this is typically adequate for up to 16 CPU
              cores.  The value should be set to a power of 2.

       olcLocalSSF: <SSF>
              Specifies the Security Strength Factor (SSF) to be given local
              LDAP sessions, such as those to the ldapi:// listener.  For a
              description of SSF values, see olcSaslSecProps's minssf option
              description.  The default is 71.

       olcLogFile: <filename>
              Specify a file for recording debug log messages. By default these
              messages only go to stderr and are not recorded anywhere else.
              Specifying a logfile copies messages to both stderr and the
              logfile.

       olcLogLevel: <integer> [...]
              Specify the level at which debugging statements and operation
              statistics should be syslogged (currently logged to the syslogd(8)
              LOG_LOCAL4 facility).  They must be considered subsystems rather
              than increasingly verbose log levels.  Some messages with higher
              priority are logged regardless of the configured loglevel as soon
              as any logging is configured.  Log levels are additive, and
              available levels are:
                     1      (0x1 trace) trace function calls
                     2      (0x2 packets) debug packet handling
                     4      (0x4 args) heavy trace debugging (function args)
                     8      (0x8 conns) connection management

                            log level is set
              The desired log level can be input as a single integer that
              combines the (ORed) desired levels, both in decimal or in
              hexadecimal notation, as a list of integers (that are ORed
              internally), or as a list of the names that are shown between
              brackets, such that

                  olcLogLevel: 129
                  olcLogLevel: 0x81
                  olcLogLevel: 128 1
                  olcLogLevel: 0x80 0x1
                  olcLogLevel: acl trace

              are equivalent.  The keyword any can be used as a shortcut to
              enable logging at all levels (equivalent to -1).  The keyword
              none, or the equivalent integer representation, causes those
              messages that are logged regardless of the configured olcLogLevel
              to be logged.  In fact, if no olcLogLevel (or a 0 level) is
              defined, no logging occurs, so at least the none level is required
              to have high priority messages logged.

       olcPasswordCryptSaltFormat: <format>
              Specify the format of the salt passed to crypt(3) when generating
              {CRYPT} passwords (see olcPasswordHash) during processing of LDAP
              Password Modify Extended Operations (RFC 3062).

              This string needs to be in sprintf(3) format and may include one
              (and only one) %s conversion.  This conversion will be substituted
              with a string of random characters from [A-Za-z0-9./].  For
              example, "%.2s" provides a two character salt and "$1$%.8s" tells
              some versions of crypt(3) to use an MD5 algorithm and provides 8
              random characters of salt.  The default is "%s", which provides 31
              characters of salt.

       olcPidFile: <filename>
              The (absolute) name of a file that will hold the slapd server's
              process ID (see getpid(2)).

       olcPluginLogFile: <filename>
              The ( absolute ) name of a file that will contain log messages
              from SLAPI plugins. See slapd.plugin(5) for details.

       olcReferral: <url>
              Specify the referral to pass back when slapd(8) cannot find a
              local database to handle a request.  If multiple values are
              specified, each url is provided.

       olcReverseLookup: TRUE | FALSE
              Enable/disable client name unverified reverse lookup (default is
              FALSE if compiled with --enable-rlookups).

       olcRootDSE: <file>
              Specify the name of an LDIF(5) file containing user defined
              attributes for the root DSE.  These attributes are returned in
              addition to the attributes normally produced by slapd.

              The root DSE is an entry with information about the server and its
              capabilities, in operational attributes.  It has the empty DN, and
              can be read with e.g.:
                  ldapsearch -x -b "" -s base "+"
              See RFC 4512 section 5.1 for details.

       olcSaslAuxprops: <plugin> [...]
              Specify which auxprop plugins to use for authentication lookups.
              The default is empty, which just uses slapd's internal support.
              Usually no other auxprop plugins are needed.

       olcSaslHost: <fqdn>
              Used to specify the fully qualified domain name used for SASL
              processing.

       olcSaslRealm: <realm>
              Specify SASL realm.  Default is empty.

       olcSaslSecProps: <properties>
              Used to specify Cyrus SASL security properties.  The none flag
              (without any other properties) causes the flag properties default,
              "noanonymous,noplain", to be cleared.  The noplain flag disables
              mechanisms susceptible to simple passive attacks.  The noactive
              flag disables mechanisms susceptible to active attacks.  The
              nodict flag disables mechanisms susceptible to passive dictionary
              attacks.  The noanonymous flag disables mechanisms which support
              anonymous login.  The forwardsec flag require forward secrecy
              between sessions.  The passcred require mechanisms which pass
              client credentials (and allow mechanisms which can pass
              credentials to do so).  The minssf=<factor> property specifies the
              minimum acceptable security strength factor as an integer
              approximate to effective key length used for encryption.  0 (zero)
              implies no protection, 1 implies integrity protection only, 56
              allows DES or other weak ciphers, 112 allows triple DES and other
              strong ciphers, 128 allows RC4, Blowfish and other modern strong
              ciphers.  The default is 0.  The maxssf=<factor> property
              specifies the maximum acceptable security strength factor as an
              integer (see minssf description).  The default is INT_MAX.  The
              maxbufsize=<size> property specifies the maximum security layer
              receive buffer size allowed.  0 disables security layers.  The
              default is 65536.

       olcServerID: <integer> [<URL>]
              Specify an integer ID from 0 to 4095 for this server (limited to 3
              hexadecimal digits).  The ID may also be specified as a
              hexadecimal ID by prefixing the value with "0x".  These IDs are
              required when using multimaster replication and each master must
              have a unique ID. Note that this requirement also applies to
              separate masters contributing to a glued set of databases.  If the
              URL is provided, this directive may be specified multiple times,
              providing a complete list of participating servers and their IDs.
              The fully qualified hostname of each server should be used in the
              supplied URLs. The IDs are used in the "replica id" field of all
              CSNs generated by the specified server. The default value is zero.
              Example:

            olcServerID: 1 ldap://ldap1.example.com
            olcServerID: 2 ldap://ldap2.example.com

       olcSockbufMaxIncoming: <integer>
              Specify the maximum incoming LDAP PDU size for anonymous sessions.
              The default is 262143.

       olcSockbufMaxIncomingAuth: <integer>
              Specify the maximum incoming LDAP PDU size for authenticated
              sessions.  The default is 4194303.

       olcTCPBuffer [listener=<URL>] [{read|write}=]<size>
              Specify the size of the TCP buffer.  A global value for both read
              and write TCP buffers related to any listener is defined, unless
              the listener is explicitly specified, or either the read or write
              qualifiers are used.  See tcp(7) for details.  Note that some OS-
              es implement automatic TCP buffer tuning.

       olcThreads: <integer>
              Specify the maximum size of the primary thread pool.  The default
              is 16; the minimum value is 2.

       olcToolThreads: <integer>
              Specify the maximum number of threads to use in tool mode.  This
              should not be greater than the number of CPUs in the system.  The
              default is 1.

       olcWriteTimeout: <integer>
              Specify the number of seconds to wait before forcibly closing a
              connection with an outstanding write.  This allows recovery from
              various network hang conditions.  A setting of 0 disables this
              feature.  The default is 0.

TLS OPTIONS
       If slapd is built with support for Transport Layer Security, there are
       more options you can specify.

       olcTLSCipherSuite: <cipher-suite-spec>
              Permits configuring what ciphers will be accepted and the
              preference order.  <cipher-suite-spec> should be a cipher
              specification for the TLS library in use (SecureTransport,
              OpenSSL, GnuTLS, or Mozilla NSS).  Example:

                     OpenSSL:
                            olcTLSCipherSuite: HIGH:MEDIUM:+SSLv2

                     GnuTLS:
                            TLSCiphersuite SECURE256:!AES-128-CBC

              To check what ciphers a given spec selects in OpenSSL, use:

                   openssl ciphers -v <cipher-suite-spec>

              With GnuTLS the available specs can be found in the manual page of
              gnutls-cli(1) (see the description of the option --priority).

              In older versions of GnuTLS, where gnutls-cli does not support the
              option --priority, you can obtain the — more limited — list of
              ciphers by calling:

                   gnutls-cli -l

              When using Mozilla NSS, the OpenSSL cipher suite specifications
              are used and translated into the format used internally by Mozilla
              NSS.  There isn't an easy way to list the cipher suites from the
              command line.  The authoritative list is in the source code for
              Mozilla NSS in the file sslinfo.c in the structure
                      static const SSLCipherSuiteInfo suiteInfo[]

              When using SecureTransport this directive uses cipher names known
              to the Security framework unless you prefix the value with
              OpenSSL: in which case it uses cipher names known to OpenSSL.

       olcTLSCACertificateFile: <filename>
              Specifies the file that contains certificates for all of the
              Certificate Authorities that slapd will recognize.

              When using SecureTransport this option is not valid.  Instead use
              the olcTLSTrustedCerts option.

       olcTLSCACertificatePath: <path>
              Specifies the path of a directory that contains Certificate
              Authority certificates in separate individual files. Usually only
              one of this or the olcTLSCACertificateFile is defined. If both are
              specified, both locations will be used. This directive is not
              supported when using GnuTLS.

              When using Mozilla NSS, <path> may contain a Mozilla NSS cert/key
              database.  If <path> contains a Mozilla NSS cert/key database and
              CA cert files, OpenLDAP will use the cert/key database and will
              ignore the CA cert files.

              When using SecureTransport this option is not valid.  Instead use
              the olcTLSTrustedCerts option.

       olcTLSCertificateFile: <filename>
              Specifies the file that contains the slapd server certificate.

              When using Mozilla NSS, if using a cert/key database (specified
              with olcTLSCACertificatePath), olcTLSCertificateFile specifies the
              name of the certificate to use:
                   olcTLSCertificateFile: Server-Cert
              If using a token other than the internal built in token, specify
              the token name first, followed by a colon:
                   olcTLSCertificateFile: my hardware device:Server-Cert
              Use certutil -L to list the certificates by name:
                   certutil -d /path/to/certdbdir -L

              When using SecureTransport this option is not valid.  Instead use
              the olcTLSIdentity option.

       olcTLSCertificateKeyFile: <filename>
              Specifies the file that contains the slapd server private key that
              matches the certificate stored in the olcTLSCertificateFile file.
              If the private key is protected with a password, the password must
              be manually typed in when slapd starts.  Usually the private key
              is not protected with a password, to allow slapd to start without
              manual intervention, so it is of critical importance that the file
              is protected carefully.

              When using Mozilla NSS, olcTLSCertificateKeyFile specifies the
              name of a file that contains the password for the key for the
              certificate specified with olcTLSCertificateFile.  The modutil
              command can be used to turn off password protection for the
              cert/key database.  For example, if olcTLSCACertificatePath
              specifes /etc/openldap/certdb as the location of the cert/key
              database, use modutil to change the password to the empty string:
                   modutil -dbdir /etc/openldap/certdb -changepw 'NSS Certificate DB'
              You must have the old password, if any.  Ignore the WARNING about
              the running browser.  Press 'Enter' for the new password.

              When using SecureTransport this option is not valid.  Instead use
              the olcTLSIdentity option.

       olcTLSDHParamFile: <filename>
              This directive specifies the file that contains parameters for
              Diffie-Hellman ephemeral key exchange.  This is required in order
              to use a DSA certificate on the server. If multiple sets of
              parameters are present in the file, all of them will be processed.
              Note that setting this option may also enable Anonymous Diffie-
              Hellman key exchanges in certain non-default cipher suites.  You
              should append "!ADH" to your cipher suites if you have changed
              them from the default, otherwise no certificate exchanges or
              verification will be done. When using GnuTLS or Mozilla NSS these
              parameters are always generated randomly so this directive is
              ignored.

       olcTLSRandFile: <filename>
              Specifies the file to obtain random bits from when /dev/[u]random
              is not available.  Generally set to the name of the EGD/PRNGD
              socket.  The environment variable RANDFILE can also be used to
              specify the filename.  This directive is ignored with
              SecureTransport, GnuTLS and Mozilla NSS.

       olcTLSVerifyClient: <level>
              Specifies what checks to perform on client certificates in an
              incoming TLS session, if any.  The <level> can be specified as one
              of the following keywords:

              never  This is the default.  slapd will not ask the client for a
                     certificate.

              allow  The client certificate is requested.  If no certificate is
                     provided, the session proceeds normally.  If a bad
                     certificate is provided, it will be ignored and the session
                     proceeds normally.

              try    The client certificate is requested.  If no certificate is
                     provided, the session proceeds normally.  If a bad
                     certificate is provided, the session is immediately
                     terminated.

              demand | hard | true
                     These keywords are all equivalent, for compatibility
                     reasons.  The client certificate is requested.  If no
                     certificate is provided, or a bad certificate is provided,
                     the session is immediately terminated.

                     Note that a valid client certificate is required in order
                     to use the SASL EXTERNAL authentication mechanism with a
                     TLS session.  As such, a non-default olcTLSVerifyClient
                     setting must be chosen to enable SASL EXTERNAL
                     authentication.

       olcTLSCRLCheck: <level>
              Specifies if the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) of the CA
              should be used to verify if the client certificates have not been
              revoked. This requires olcTLSCACertificatePath parameter to be
              set. This parameter is ignored with GnuTLS and Mozilla NSS.
              <level> can be specified as one of the following keywords:

              none   No CRL checks are performed

              peer   Check the CRL of the peer certificate

              all    Check the CRL for a whole certificate chain

       olcTLSCRLFile: <filename>
              Specifies a file containing a Certificate Revocation List to be
              used for verifying that certificates have not been revoked. This
              parameter is only valid when using GnuTLS or Mozilla NSS.

       olcTLSIdentity
              Names the identity in the system keychain.  An identity is a
              certificate paired with a private key.

              Used by SecureTransport instead of olcTLSCertificateFile and
              olcTLSCertificateKeyFile.  Ignored by OpenSSL, GnuTLS and Mozilla
              NSS.

       olcTLSTrustedCerts
              Lists the trusted certificates in the system keychain separated by
              '|'.  For example: olcTLSTrustedCerts Frobozz, Inc.|Widgets R
              Us|www.example.com

              Used by SecureTransport instead of olcTLSCACertificateFile and
              olcTLSCACertificatePath.  Ignored by OpenSSL, GnuTLS and Mozilla
              NSS.

DYNAMIC MODULE OPTIONS
       If slapd is compiled with --enable-modules then the module-related
       entries will be available. These entries are named cn=module{x},cn=config
       and must have the olcModuleList objectClass. One entry should be created
       per olcModulePath.  Normally the config engine generates the "{x}" index
       in the RDN automatically, so it can be omitted when initially loading
       these entries.

       olcModuleLoad: <filename>
              Specify the name of a dynamically loadable module to load. The
              filename may be an absolute path name or a simple filename. Non-
              absolute names are searched for in the directories specified by
              the olcModulePath option.

       olcModulePath: <pathspec>
              Specify a list of directories to search for loadable modules.
              Typically the path is colon-separated but this depends on the
              operating system.  The default is MODULEDIR, which is where the
              standard OpenLDAP install will place its modules.

SCHEMA OPTIONS
       Schema definitions are created as entries in the cn=schema,cn=config
       subtree. These entries must have the olcSchemaConfig objectClass.  As
       noted above, the actual cn=schema,cn=config entry is predefined and any
       values specified for it are ignored.

              [SUP <oid>] [EQUALITY <oid>] [ORDERING <oid>] [SUBSTR <oid>]
              [SYNTAX <oidlen>] [SINGLE-VALUE] [COLLECTIVE]
              [NO-USER-MODIFICATION] [USAGE <attributeUsage>] )
              Specify an attribute type using the LDAPv3 syntax defined in RFC
              4512.  The slapd parser extends the RFC 4512 definition by
              allowing string forms as well as numeric OIDs to be used for the
              attribute OID and attribute syntax OID.  (See the
              olcObjectIdentifier description.)


       olcDitContentRules: ( <oid> [NAME <name>] [DESC <description>] [OBSOLETE]
              [AUX <oids>] [MUST <oids>] [MAY <oids>] [NOT <oids>] )
              Specify an DIT Content Rule using the LDAPv3 syntax defined in RFC
              4512.  The slapd parser extends the RFC 4512 definition by
              allowing string forms as well as numeric OIDs to be used for the
              attribute OID and attribute syntax OID.  (See the
              olcObjectIdentifier description.)


       olcObjectClasses: ( <oid> [NAME <name>] [DESC <description>] [OBSOLETE]
              [SUP <oids>] [{ ABSTRACT | STRUCTURAL | AUXILIARY }] [MUST <oids>]
              [MAY <oids>] )
              Specify an objectclass using the LDAPv3 syntax defined in RFC
              4512.  The slapd parser extends the RFC 4512 definition by
              allowing string forms as well as numeric OIDs to be used for the
              object class OID.  (See the olcObjectIdentifier description.)
              Object classes are "STRUCTURAL" by default.

       olcObjectIdentifier: <name> { <oid> | <name>[:<suffix>] }
              Define a string name that equates to the given OID. The string can
              be used in place of the numeric OID in objectclass and attribute
              definitions. The name can also be used with a suffix of the form
              ":xx" in which case the value "oid.xx" will be used.


GENERAL BACKEND OPTIONS
       Options in these entries only apply to the configuration of a single type
       of backend. All backends may support this class of options.  The entry
       must be named olcBackend=<databasetype>,cn=config and must have the
       olcBackendConfig objectClass.  <databasetype> should be one of bdb,
       config, dnssrv, hdb, ldap, ldif, meta, monitor, null, passwd, perl,
       relay, shell, or sql.  At present, no backend implements any options of
       this type.


DATABASE OPTIONS
       Database options are set in entries named
       olcDatabase={x}<databasetype>,cn=config and must have the
       olcDatabaseConfig objectClass. Normally the config engine generates the
       "{x}" index in the RDN automatically, so it can be omitted when initially
       loading these entries.

       The special frontend database is always numbered "{-1}" and the config
       database is always numbered "{0}".


GLOBAL DATABASE OPTIONS
       Options in this section may be set in the special "frontend" database and
       inherited in all the other databases. These options may be altered by
       further settings in each specific database. The frontend entry must be
       named olcDatabase=frontend,cn=config and must have the olcFrontendConfig
       objectClass.

       olcAccess: to <what> [ by <who> <access> <control> ]+
              Grant access (specified by <access>) to a set of entries and/or
              attributes (specified by <what>) by one or more requestors
              (specified by <who>).  If no access controls are present, the
              default policy allows anyone and everyone to read anything but
              restricts updates to rootdn.  (e.g., "olcAccess: to * by * read").
              See slapd.access(5) and the "OpenLDAP Administrator's Guide" for
              details.

              Access controls set in the frontend are appended to any access
              controls set on the specific databases.  The rootdn of a database
              can always read and write EVERYTHING in that database.

              Extra special care must be taken with the access controls on the
              config database. Unlike other databases, the default policy for
              the config database is to only allow access to the rootdn. Regular
              users should not have read access, and write access should be
              granted very carefully to privileged administrators.


       olcDefaultSearchBase: <dn>
              Specify a default search base to use when client submits a non-
              base search request with an empty base DN.  Base scoped search
              requests with an empty base DN are not affected.  This setting is
              only allowed in the frontend entry.

       olcPasswordHash: <hash> [<hash>...]
              This option configures one or more hashes to be used in generation
              of user passwords stored in the userPassword attribute during
              processing of LDAP Password Modify Extended Operations (RFC 3062).
              The <hash> must be one of {SSHA}, {SHA}, {SMD5}, {MD5}, {CRYPT},
              and {CLEARTEXT}.  The default is {SSHA}.

              {SHA} and {SSHA} use the SHA-1 algorithm (FIPS 160-1), the latter
              with a seed.

              {MD5} and {SMD5} use the MD5 algorithm (RFC 1321), the latter with
              a seed.

              {CRYPT} uses the crypt(3).

              {CLEARTEXT} indicates that the new password should be added to
              userPassword as clear text.

              Note that this option does not alter the normal user applications
              handling of userPassword during LDAP Add, Modify, or other LDAP
              operations.  This setting is only allowed in the frontend entry.

       olcReadOnly: TRUE | FALSE
              This option puts the database into "read-only" mode.  Any attempts
              to modify the database will return an "unwilling to perform"
              error.  By default, olcReadOnly is FALSE. Note that when this
              option is set TRUE on the frontend, it cannot be reset without
              restarting the server, since further writes to the config database
              will be rejected.

       olcRequires: <conditions>
              Specify a set of conditions to require (default none).  The
              directive may be specified globally and/or per-database; databases
              inherit global conditions, so per-database specifications are
              additive.  bind requires bind operation prior to directory
              operations.  LDAPv3 requires session to be using LDAP version 3.
              authc requires authentication prior to directory operations.  SASL
              requires SASL authentication prior to directory operations.
              strong requires strong authentication prior to directory
              operations.  The strong keyword allows protected "simple"
              authentication as well as SASL authentication.  none may be used
              to require no conditions (useful to clear out globally set
              conditions within a particular database); it must occur first in
              the list of conditions.

       olcRestrict: <oplist>
              Specify a list of operations that are restricted.  Restrictions on
              a specific database override any frontend setting.  Operations can
              be any of add, bind, compare, delete, extended[=<OID>], modify,
              rename, search, or the special pseudo-operations read and write,
              which respectively summarize read and write operations.  The use
              of restrict write is equivalent to olcReadOnly: TRUE (see above).
              The extended keyword allows to indicate the OID of the specific
              operation to be restricted.

       olcSchemaDN: <dn>
              Specify the distinguished name for the subschema subentry that
              controls the entries on this server.  The default is
              "cn=Subschema".

       olcSecurity: <factors>
              Specify a set of security strength factors (separated by white
              space) to require (see olcSaslSecprops's minssf option for a
              description of security strength factors).  The directive may be
              specified globally and/or per-database.  ssf=<n> specifies the
              overall security strength factor.  transport=<n> specifies the
              transport security strength factor.  tls=<n> specifies the TLS
              security strength factor.  sasl=<n> specifies the SASL security
              strength factor.  update_ssf=<n> specifies the overall security
              strength factor to require for directory updates.
              update_transport=<n> specifies the transport security strength
              factor to require for directory updates.  update_tls=<n> specifies
              the TLS security strength factor to require for directory updates.
              update_sasl=<n> specifies the SASL security strength factor to
              require for directory updates.  simple_bind=<n> specifies the
              security strength factor required for simple username/password
              authentication.  Note that the transport factor is measure of
              security provided by the underlying transport, e.g. ldapi:// (and
              eventually IPSEC).  It is not normally used.

       olcSizeLimit: {<integer>|unlimited}

       olcSizeLimit: size[.{soft|hard|unchecked}]=<integer> [...]
              Specify the maximum number of entries to return from a search
              operation.  The default size limit is 500.  Use unlimited to
              specify no limits.  The second format allows a fine grain setting
              of the size limits.  Extra args can be added in the same value or
              as additional values.  See olcLimits for an explanation of the
              different flags.

       olcSortVals: <attr> [...]
              Specify a list of multi-valued attributes whose values will always
              be maintained in sorted order. Using this option will allow
              Modify, Compare, and filter evaluations on these attributes to be
              performed more efficiently. The resulting sort order depends on
              the attributes' syntax and matching rules and may not correspond
              to lexical order or any other recognizable order.  This setting is
              only allowed in the frontend entry.

       olcTimeLimit: {<integer>|unlimited}

       olcTimeLimit: time[.{soft|hard}]=<integer> [...]
              Specify the maximum number of seconds (in real time) slapd will
              spend answering a search request.  The default time limit is 3600.
              Use unlimited to specify no limits.  The second format allows a
              fine grain setting of the time limits.  Extra args can be added in
              the same value or as additional values.  See olcLimits for an
              explanation of the different flags.


GENERAL DATABASE OPTIONS
       Options in this section only apply to the specific database for which
       they are defined.  They are supported by every type of backend. All of
       the Global Database Options may also be used here.

       olcAddContentAcl: TRUE | FALSE
              Controls whether Add operations will perform ACL checks on the
              content of the entry being added. This check is off by default.
              See the slapd.access(5) manual page for more details on ACL
              requirements for Add operations.

       olcHidden: TRUE | FALSE
              Controls whether the database will be used to answer queries. A
              database that is hidden will never be selected to answer any
              queries, and any suffix configured on the database will be ignored
              in checks for conflicts with other databases. By default,
              olcHidden is FALSE.

       olcLastMod: TRUE | FALSE
              Controls whether slapd will automatically maintain the
              modifiersName, modifyTimestamp, creatorsName, and createTimestamp
              attributes for entries. It also controls the entryCSN and
              entryUUID attributes, which are needed by the syncrepl provider.
              By default, olcLastMod is TRUE.

       olcLimits: <selector> <limit> [<limit> [...]]
              Specify time and size limits based on the operation's initiator or
              base DN.  The argument <selector> can be any of

                     anonymous | users | [<dnspec>=]<pattern> |
                     group[/oc[/at]]=<pattern>

              with

                     <dnspec> ::= dn[.<type>][.<style>]

                     <type>  ::= self | this

                     <style> ::= exact | base | onelevel | subtree | children |
                     regex | anonymous

              DN type self is the default and means the bound user, while this
              means the base DN of the operation.  The term anonymous matches
              all unauthenticated clients.  The term users matches all
              authenticated clients; otherwise an exact dn pattern is assumed
              unless otherwise specified by qualifying the (optional) key string
              dn with exact or base (which are synonyms), to require an exact
              match; with onelevel, to require exactly one level of depth match;
              with subtree, to allow any level of depth match, including the
              exact match; with children, to allow any level of depth match, not
              including the exact match; regex explicitly requires the (default)
              match based on POSIX (''extended'') regular expression pattern.
              Finally, anonymous matches unbound operations; the pattern field
              is ignored.  The same behavior is obtained by using the anonymous
              form of the <selector> clause.  The term group, with the optional
              objectClass oc and attributeType at fields, followed by pattern,
              sets the limits for any DN listed in the values of the at
              attribute (default member) of the oc group objectClass (default
              groupOfNames) whose DN exactly matches pattern.

              The currently supported limits are size and time.

              The syntax for time limits is time[.{soft|hard}]=<integer>, where
              integer is the number of seconds slapd will spend answering a
              search request.  If no time limit is explicitly requested by the
              client, the soft limit is used; if the requested time limit
              exceeds the hard limit, the value of the limit is used instead.
              If the hard limit is set to the keyword soft, the soft limit is
              used in either case; if it is set to the keyword unlimited, no
              hard limit is enforced.  Explicit requests for time limits smaller
              or equal to the hard limit are honored.  If no limit specifier is
              set, the value is assigned to the soft limit, and the hard limit
              is set to soft, to preserve the original behavior.

              The syntax for size limits is
              size[.{soft|hard|unchecked}]=<integer>, where integer is the
              maximum number of entries slapd will return answering a search
              request.  If no size limit is explicitly requested by the client,
              the soft limit is used; if the requested size limit exceeds the
              hard limit, the value of the limit is used instead.  If the hard
              limit is set to the keyword soft, the soft limit is used in either
              case; if it is set to the keyword unlimited, no hard limit is
              enforced.  Explicit requests for size limits smaller or equal to
              the hard limit are honored.  The unchecked specifier sets a limit
              on the number of candidates a search request is allowed to
              examine.  The rationale behind it is that searches for non-
              properly indexed attributes may result in large sets of
              candidates, which must be examined by slapd(8) to determine
              whether they match the search filter or not.  The unchecked limit
              provides a means to drop such operations before they are even
              started.  If the selected candidates exceed the unchecked limit,
              the search will abort with Unwilling to perform.  If it is set to
              the keyword unlimited, no limit is applied (the default).  If it
              is set to disable, the search is not even performed; this can be
              used to disallow searches for a specific set of users.  If no
              limit specifier is set, the value is assigned to the soft limit,
              and the hard limit is set to soft, to preserve the original
              behavior.

              In case of no match, the global limits are used.  The default
              values are the same as for olcSizeLimit and olcTimeLimit; no limit
              is set on unchecked.

              If pagedResults control is requested, the hard size limit is used
              by default, because the request of a specific page size is
              considered an explicit request for a limitation on the number of
              entries to be returned.  However, the size limit applies to the
              total count of entries returned within the search, and not to a
              single page.  Additional size limits may be enforced; the syntax
              is size.pr={<integer>|noEstimate|unlimited}, where integer is the
              max page size if no explicit limit is set; the keyword noEstimate
              inhibits the server from returning an estimate of the total number
              of entries that might be returned (note: the current
              implementation does not return any estimate).  The keyword
              unlimited indicates that no limit is applied to the pagedResults
              control page size.  The syntax
              size.prtotal={<integer>|unlimited|disabled} allows to set a limit
              on the total number of entries that a pagedResults control allows
              to return.  By default it is set to the hard limit.  When set,
              integer is the max number of entries that the whole search with
              pagedResults control can return.  Use unlimited to allow unlimited
              number of entries to be returned, e.g. to allow the use of the
              pagedResults control as a means to circumvent size limitations on
              regular searches; the keyword disabled disables the control, i.e.
              no paged results can be returned.  Note that the total number of
              entries returned when the pagedResults control is requested cannot
              exceed the hard size limit of regular searches unless extended by
              the prtotal switch.

       olcMaxDerefDepth: <depth>
              Specifies the maximum number of aliases to dereference when trying
              to resolve an entry, used to avoid infinite alias loops. The
              default is 15.

       olcMirrorMode: TRUE | FALSE
              This option puts a replica database into "mirror" mode.  Update
              operations will be accepted from any user, not just the updatedn.
              The database must already be configured as syncrepl consumer
              before this keyword may be set.  This mode also requires a
              olcServerID (see above) to be configured.  By default, this
              setting is FALSE.

       olcPlugin: <plugin_type> <lib_path> <init_function> [<arguments>]
              Configure a SLAPI plugin. See the slapd.plugin(5) manpage for more
              details.

       olcRootDN: <dn>
              Specify the distinguished name that is not subject to access
              control or administrative limit restrictions for operations on
              this database.  This DN may or may not be associated with an
              entry.  An empty root DN (the default) specifies no root access is
              to be granted.  It is recommended that the rootdn only be
              specified when needed (such as when initially populating a
              database).  If the rootdn is within a namingContext (suffix) of
              the database, a simple bind password may also be provided using
              the olcRootPW directive. Note that the rootdn is always needed
              when using syncrepl.  The olcRootDN of the cn=config database
              defaults to cn=config itself.

       olcRootPW: <password>
              Specify a password (or hash of the password) for the rootdn.  The
              password can only be set if the rootdn is within the namingContext
              (suffix) of the database.  This option accepts all RFC 2307
              userPassword formats known to the server (see olcPasswordHash
              description) as well as cleartext.  slappasswd(8) may be used to
              generate a hash of a password.  Cleartext and {CRYPT} passwords
              are not recommended.  If empty (the default), authentication of
              the root DN is by other means (e.g. SASL).  Use of SASL is
              encouraged.

       olcSubordinate: [TRUE | FALSE | advertise]
              Specify that the current backend database is a subordinate of
              another backend database. A subordinate  database may have only
              one suffix. This option may be used to glue multiple databases
              into a single namingContext.  If the suffix of the current
              database is within the namingContext of a superior database,
              searches against the superior database will be propagated to the
              subordinate as well. All of the databases associated with a single
              namingContext should have identical rootdns.  Behavior of other
              LDAP operations is unaffected by this setting. In particular, it
              is not possible to use moddn to move an entry from one subordinate
              to another subordinate within the namingContext.

              If the optional advertise flag is supplied, the naming context of
              this database is advertised in the root DSE. The default is to
              hide this database context, so that only the superior context is
              visible.

              If the slap tools slapcat(8), slapadd(8), or slapindex(8) are used
              on the superior database, any glued subordinates that support
              these tools are opened as well.

              Databases that are glued together should usually be configured
              with the same indices (assuming they support indexing), even for
              attributes that only exist in some of these databases. In general,
              all of the glued databases should be configured as similarly as
              possible, since the intent is to provide the appearance of a
              single directory.

              Note that the subordinate functionality is implemented internally
              by the glue overlay and as such its behavior will interact with
              other overlays in use. By default, the glue overlay is
              automatically configured as the last overlay on the superior
              database. Its position on the database can be explicitly
              configured by setting an overlay glue directive at the desired
              position. This explicit configuration is necessary e.g.  when
              using the syncprov overlay, which needs to follow glue in order to
              work over all of the glued databases. E.g.
                   dn: olcDatabase={1}bdb,cn=config
                   olcSuffix: dc=example,dc=com
                   ...

                   dn: olcOverlay={0}glue,olcDatabase={1}bdb,cn=config
                   ...

                   dn: olcOverlay={1}syncprov,olcDatabase={1}bdb,cn=config
                   ...
       See the Overlays section below for more details.

       olcSuffix: <dn suffix>
              Specify the DN suffix of queries that will be passed to this
              backend database.  Multiple suffix lines can be given and at least
              one is required for each database definition.

              If the suffix of one database is "inside" that of another, the
              database with the inner suffix must come first in the
              configuration file.  You may also want to glue such databases
              together with the olcSubordinate attribute.

       olcSyncUseSubentry: TRUE | FALSE
              Store the syncrepl contextCSN in a subentry instead of the context
              entry of the database. The subentry's RDN will be "cn=ldapsync".
              The default is FALSE, meaning the contextCSN is stored in the
              context entry.

       olcSyncrepl: rid=<replica ID> provider=ldap[s]://<hostname>[:port]
              searchbase=<base DN> [type=refreshOnly|refreshAndPersist]

              [suffixmassage=<real DN>] [logbase=<base DN>] [logfilter=<filter
              str>] [syncdata=default|accesslog|changelog]
              Specify the current database as a replica which is kept up-to-date
              with the master content by establishing the current slapd(8) as a
              replication consumer site running a syncrepl replication engine.
              The replica content is kept synchronized to the master content
              using the LDAP Content Synchronization protocol. Refer to the
              "OpenLDAP Administrator's Guide" for detailed information on
              setting up a replicated slapd directory service using the syncrepl
              replication engine.

              rid identifies the current syncrepl directive within the
              replication consumer site.  It is a non-negative integer having no
              more than three decimal digits.

              provider specifies the replication provider site containing the
              master content as an LDAP URI. If <port> is not given, the
              standard LDAP port number (389 or 636) is used.

              The content of the syncrepl replica is defined using a search
              specification as its result set. The consumer slapd will send
              search requests to the provider slapd according to the search
              specification. The search specification includes searchbase,
              scope, filter, attrs, attrsonly, sizelimit, and timelimit
              parameters as in the normal search specification. The exattrs
              option may also be used to specify attributes that should be
              omitted from incoming entries.  The scope defaults to sub, the
              filter defaults to (objectclass=*), and there is no default
              searchbase. The attrs list defaults to "*,+" to return all user
              and operational attributes, and attrsonly and exattrs are unset by
              default.  The sizelimit and timelimit only accept "unlimited" and
              positive integers, and both default to "unlimited".  Note,
              however, that any provider-side limits for the replication
              identity will be enforced by the provider regardless of the limits
              requested by the LDAP Content Synchronization operation, much like
              for any other search operation.

              The LDAP Content Synchronization protocol has two operation types.
              In the refreshOnly operation, the next synchronization search
              operation is periodically rescheduled at an interval time
              (specified by interval parameter; 1 day by default) after each
              synchronization operation finishes.  In the refreshAndPersist
              operation, a synchronization search remains persistent in the
              provider slapd.  Further updates to the master replica will
              generate searchResultEntry to the consumer slapd as the search
              responses to the persistent synchronization search.

              If an error occurs during replication, the consumer will attempt
              to reconnect according to the retry parameter which is a list of
              the <retry interval> and <# of retries> pairs.  For example,
              retry="60 10 300 3" lets the consumer retry every 60 seconds for
              the first 10 times and then retry every 300 seconds for the next 3
              times before stop retrying. The `+' in <# of retries> means
              indefinite number of retries until success.

              The schema checking can be enforced at the LDAP Sync consumer site
              by turning on the schemachecking parameter. The default is off.

              The network-timeout parameter sets how long the consumer will wait
              to establish a network connection to the provider. Once a
              connection is established, the timeout parameter determines how
              long the consumer will wait for the initial Bind request to
              complete. The defaults for these parameters come from
              ldap.conf(5).

              A bindmethod of simple requires the options binddn and credentials
              and should only be used when adequate security services (e.g. TLS
              or IPSEC) are in place.  A bindmethod of sasl requires the option
              saslmech.  Depending on the mechanism, an authentication identity
              and/or credentials can be specified using authcid and credentials.
              The authzid parameter may be used to specify an authorization
              identity.  Specific security properties (as with the sasl-secprops
              keyword above) for a SASL bind can be set with the secprops
              option. A non default SASL realm can be set with the realm option.
              The provider, other than allow authentication of the syncrepl
              identity, should grant that identity appropriate access privileges
              to the data that is being replicated (access directive), and
              appropriate time and size limits (limits directive).

              The keepalive parameter sets the values of idle, probes, and
              interval used to check whether a socket is alive; idle is the
              number of seconds a connection needs to remain idle before TCP
              starts sending keepalive probes; probes is the maximum number of
              keepalive probes TCP should send before dropping the connection;
              interval is interval in seconds between individual keepalive
              probes.  Only some systems support the customization of these
              values; the keepalive parameter is ignored otherwise, and system-
              wide settings are used.

              The starttls parameter specifies use of the StartTLS extended
              operation to establish a TLS session before Binding to the
              provider. If the critical argument is supplied, the session will
              be aborted if the StartTLS request fails. Otherwise the syncrepl
              session continues without TLS. The tls_reqcert setting defaults to
              "demand" and the other TLS settings default to the same as the
              main slapd TLS settings.

              The suffixmassage parameter allows the consumer to pull entries
              from a remote directory whose DN suffix differs from the local
              directory. The portion of the remote entries' DNs that matches the
              searchbase will be replaced with the suffixmassage DN.

              Rather than replicating whole entries, the consumer can query logs
              of data modifications. This mode of operation is referred to as
              delta syncrepl. In addition to the above parameters, the logbase
              and logfilter parameters must be set appropriately for the log
              that will be used. The syncdata parameter must be set to either
              "accesslog" if the log conforms to the slapo-accesslog(5) log
              format, or "changelog" if the log conforms to the obsolete
              changelog format. If the syncdata parameter is omitted or set to
              "default" then the log parameters are ignored.

       olcUpdateDN: <dn>
              This option is only applicable in a slave database.  It specifies
              the DN permitted to update (subject to access controls) the
              replica.  It is only needed in certain push-mode replication
              scenarios.  Generally, this DN should not be the same as the
              rootdn used at the master.

       olcUpdateRef: <url>
              Specify the referral to pass back when slapd(8) is asked to modify
              a replicated local database.  If multiple values are specified,
              each url is provided.


DATABASE-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       Each database may allow specific configuration options; they are
       documented separately in the backends' manual pages. See the
       slapd.backends(5) manual page for an overview of available backends.

OVERLAYS
       An overlay is a piece of code that intercepts database operations in
       order to extend or change them. Overlays are pushed onto a stack over the
       database, and so they will execute in the reverse of the order in which
       they were configured and the database itself will receive control last of
       all.

       Overlays must be configured as child entries of a specific database. The
       entry's RDN must be of the form olcOverlay={x}<overlaytype> and the entry
       must have the olcOverlayConfig objectClass. Normally the config engine
       generates the "{x}" index in the RDN automatically, so it can be omitted
       when initially loading these entries.

       See the slapd.overlays(5) manual page for an overview of available
       overlays.

EXAMPLES
       Here is a short example of a configuration in LDIF suitable for use with
       slapadd(8) :

              dn: cn=config
              objectClass: olcGlobal
              cn: config
              olcPidFile: /var/db/openldap/run/slapd.pid

              objectClass: olcSchemaConfig
              cn: schema

              include: /etc/openldap/schema/core.ldif

              dn: olcDatabase=frontend,cn=config
              objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
              objectClass: olcFrontendConfig
              olcDatabase: frontend
              # Subtypes of "name" (e.g. "cn" and "ou") with the
              # option ";x-hidden" can be searched for/compared,
              # but are not shown.  See slapd.access(5).
              olcAccess: to attrs=name;x-hidden by * =cs
              # Protect passwords.  See slapd.access(5).
              olcAccess: to attrs=userPassword  by * auth
              # Read access to other attributes and entries.
              olcAccess: to * by * read

              # set a rootpw for the config database so we can bind.
              # deny access to everyone else.
              dn: olcDatabase=config,cn=config
              objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
              olcDatabase: config
              olcRootPW: {SSHA}XKYnrjvGT3wZFQrDD5040US592LxsdLy

              objectClass: olcBdbConfig
              olcDatabase: bdb
              olcSuffix: "dc=our-domain,dc=com"
              # The database directory MUST exist prior to
              # running slapd AND should only be accessible
              # by the slapd/tools. Mode 0700 recommended.
              olcDbDirectory: /var/db/openldap/openldap-data
              # Indices to maintain
              olcDbIndex:     objectClass  eq
              olcDbIndex:     cn,sn,mail   pres,eq,approx,sub

              # We serve small clients that do not handle referrals,
              # so handle remote lookups on their behalf.
              dn: olcDatabase=ldap,cn=config
              objectClass: olcDatabaseConfig
              objectClass: olcLdapConfig
              olcDatabase: ldap
              olcSuffix: ""
              olcDbUri: ldap://ldap.some-server.com/

       Assuming the above data was saved in a file named "config.ldif" and the
       /etc/openldap/slapd.d directory has been created, this command will
       initialize the configuration:
              slapadd -F /etc/openldap/slapd.d -n 0 -l config.ldif


       "OpenLDAP Administrator's Guide" contains a longer annotated example of a
       slapd configuration.

       Alternatively, an existing slapd.conf file can be converted to the new
       format using slapd or any of the slap tools:
              slaptest -f /etc/openldap/slapd.conf -F ETCDIR/slapd.d
