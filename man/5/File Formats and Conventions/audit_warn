AUDIT_WARN(5)                  File Formats Manual                 AUDIT_WARN(5)

NAME
     audit_warn â€“ alert when audit daemon issues warnings

DESCRIPTION (NOW DEPRECATED)
     The audit_warn script runs when auditd(8) generates warning messages.

     The default audit_warn is a script whose first parameter is the type of
     warning; the script appends its arguments to /etc/security/audit_messages.
     Administrators may replace this script: a more comprehensive one would take
     different actions based on the type of warning.  For example, a low-space
     warning could result in an email message being sent to the administrator.

FILES
