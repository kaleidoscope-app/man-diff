SLAPO-VALSORT(5)               File Formats Manual              SLAPO-VALSORT(5)



NAME
       slapo-valsort - Value Sorting overlay to slapd

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The Value Sorting overlay can be used with a backend database to sort the
       values of specific multi-valued attributes within a subtree. The sorting
       occurs whenever the attributes are returned in a search response.

       Sorting can be specified in ascending or descending order, using either
       numeric or alphanumeric sort methods. Additionally, a "weighted" sort can
       be specified, which uses a numeric weight prepended to the attribute
       values.  The weighted sort is always performed in ascending order, but
       may be combined with the other methods for values that all have equal
       weights. The weight is specified by prepending an integer weight
       {<weight>} in front of each value of the attribute for which weighted
       sorting is desired. This weighting factor is stripped off and never
       returned in search results.


CONFIGURATION
       These slapd.conf options apply to the Value Sorting overlay.  They should
       appear after the overlay directive.

       valsort-attr <attribute> <baseDN> (<sort-method> | weighted [<sort-
       method>])
              Configure a sorting method for the specified attribute in the
              subtree rooted at baseDN.  The sort-method may be one of
              alpha-ascend, alpha-descend, numeric-ascend, or numeric-descend.
              If the special weighted method is specified, a secondary
              sort-method may also be specified. It is an error to specify an
              alphanumeric sort-method for an attribute with Integer or
              NumericString syntax, and it is an error to specify a numeric
              sort-method for an attribute with a syntax other than Integer or
              NumericString.

EXAMPLES
            database bdb
            suffix dc=example,dc=com
            ...
            overlay valsort
            valsort-attr member ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com alpha-ascend
