UTF8(5)                        File Formats Manual                       UTF8(5)

NAME
     utf8 – UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646

SYNOPSIS
     ENCODING "UTF-8"

DESCRIPTION
     The UTF-8 encoding represents UCS-4 characters as a sequence of octets,
     using between 1 and 6 for each character.  It is backwards compatible with
     ASCII, so 0x00-0x7f refer to the ASCII character set.  The multibyte
     encoding of non-ASCII characters consist entirely of bytes whose high order
     bit is set.  The actual encoding is represented by the following table:

     [0x00000000 - 0x0000007f] [00000000.0bbbbbbb] -> 0bbbbbbb
     [0x00000080 - 0x000007ff] [00000bbb.bbbbbbbb] -> 110bbbbb, 10bbbbbb
     [0x00000800 - 0x0000ffff] [bbbbbbbb.bbbbbbbb] ->
             1110bbbb, 10bbbbbb, 10bbbbbb
     [0x00010000 - 0x001fffff] [00000000.000bbbbb.bbbbbbbb.bbbbbbbb] ->
             11110bbb, 10bbbbbb, 10bbbbbb, 10bbbbbb
     [0x00200000 - 0x03ffffff] [000000bb.bbbbbbbb.bbbbbbbb.bbbbbbbb] ->
             111110bb, 10bbbbbb, 10bbbbbb, 10bbbbbb, 10bbbbbb
     [0x04000000 - 0x7fffffff] [0bbbbbbb.bbbbbbbb.bbbbbbbb.bbbbbbbb] ->
             1111110b, 10bbbbbb, 10bbbbbb, 10bbbbbb, 10bbbbbb, 10bbbbbb

     If more than a single representation of a value exists (for example, 0x00;
     0xC0 0x80; 0xE0 0x80 0x80) the shortest representation is always used.
     Longer ones are detected as an error as they pose a potential security
     risk, and destroy the 1:1 character:octet sequence mapping.
