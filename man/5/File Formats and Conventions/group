GROUP(5)                       File Formats Manual                      GROUP(5)

NAME
     group – format of the group permissions file

DESCRIPTION
     The file ⟨/etc/group⟩ consists of newline separated ASCII records, one per
     group, containing four colon ‘:’ separated fields. These fields are as
     follows:
           group     Name of the group.
           passwd    Group's encrypted password.
           gid       The group's decimal ID.
           member    Group members.

     The group field is the group name used for granting file access to users
     who are members of the group.  The gid field is the number associated with
     the group name.  They should both be unique across the system (and often
     across a group of systems) since they control file access.  The passwd
     field is an optional encrypted password.  This field is rarely used and an
     asterisk is normally placed in it rather than leaving it blank.  The member
     field contains the names of users granted the privileges of group.  The
     member names are separated by commas without spaces or newlines.  A user is
     automatically in a group if that group was specified in their /etc/passwd
     entry and does not need to be added to that group in the /etc/group file.

INTERACTION WITH DIRECTORY SERVICES
     Processes generally find group records using one of the getgrent(3) family
     of functions.  On Mac OS X, these functions interact with the
     DirectoryService(8) daemon, which reads the /etc/group file as well as
     searching other directory information services to determine groups and
     group membership.

FILES
     /etc/group

BUGS
