SLAPD-PASSWD(5)                File Formats Manual               SLAPD-PASSWD(5)



NAME
       slapd-passwd - /etc/passwd backend to slapd

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The PASSWD backend to slapd(8) serves up the user account information
       listed in the system passwd(5) file.  This backend is provided for
       demonstration purposes only.  The DN of each entry is
       "uid=<username>,<suffix>".  Note that non-base searches scan the the
       entire passwd file, and are best suited for hosts with small passwd
       files.

CONFIGURATION
       This slapd.conf option applies to the PASSWD backend database.  That is,
       it must follow a "database passwd" line and come before any subsequent
       "backend" or "database" lines.  Other database options are described in
       the slapd.conf(5) manual page.

       file <filename>
              Specifies an alternate passwd file to use.  The default is
              /etc/passwd.

ACCESS CONTROL
       The passwd backend does not honor any of the access control semantics
       described in slapd.access(5).  Only read (=r) access to the entry pseudo-
       attribute and to the other attribute values of the entries returned by
       the search operation is honored, which is performed by the frontend.
