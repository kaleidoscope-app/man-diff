NAME
     bootptab â€“ Internet Bootstrap Protocol server database

DESCRIPTION
     The file /etc/bootptab contains a list of host entries used by bootpd (see
     bootpd(8)) to associate a hardware address with a particular IP address.

     The bootptab file contains two sections.   The two sections are separated
     by a single line containing just "%%".  The first section is ignored.  The
     second section contains host entries, one host per line.  The format of the
     line is:
     hostname     hwtype     hwaddr     ipaddr     bootfile
