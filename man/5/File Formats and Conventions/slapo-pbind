NAME
       slapo-pbind - proxy bind overlay to slapd

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The pbind overlay to slapd(8) forwards Simple Binds on a local database
       to a remote LDAP server instead of processing them locally. The remote
       connection is managed using an instance of the ldap backend.


       The pbind overlay uses a subset of the ldap backend's config directives.
       They are described in more detail in slapd-ldap(5).

       Note: this overlay is built into the ldap backend; it is not a separate
       module.


       overlay pbind
              This directive adds the proxy bind overlay to the current backend.
              The proxy bind overlay may be used with any backend, but it is
              mainly intended for use with local storage backends.


       uri <ldapurl>
              LDAP server to use.


       tls <TLS parameters>
              Specify the use of TLS.


       network-timeout <time>
              Set the network timeout.


       quarantine <quarantine parameters>
              Turns on quarantine of URIs that returned LDAP_UNAVAILABLE.
