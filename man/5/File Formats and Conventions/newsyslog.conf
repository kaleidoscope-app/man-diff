NEWSYSLOG.CONF(5)              File Formats Manual             NEWSYSLOG.CONF(5)

NAME
     newsyslog.conf – newsyslog(8) configuration file

DESCRIPTION
     The newsyslog.conf file is used to set log file rotation configuration for
     the newsyslog(8) utility.  Configuration may designate that logs are
     rotated based on size, last rotation time, or time of day.  The
     newsyslog.conf file can also be used to designate secure permissions to log
     files at rotation time.  During initialization, newsyslog(8) reads a
     configuration file, normally /etc/newsyslog.conf, to determine which logs
     may potentially be rotated and archived.  Each line has five mandatory
     fields and four optional fields, separated with whitespace.  Blank lines or
     lines beginning with ‘#’ are ignored.  If ‘#’ is placed in the middle of
     the line, the ‘#’ character and the rest of the line after it is ignored.
     To prevent special meaning, the ‘#’ character may be escaped with ‘\’; in
     this case preceding ‘\’ is removed and ‘#’ is treated as an ordinary
     character.  The fields of the configuration file are as follows:

     logfile_name
             Name of the system log file to be archived, or the literal string
             “⟨default⟩”.  The special default entry will only be used if a log
             file name is given as a command line argument to newsyslog(8), and
             if that log file name is not matched by any other line in the
             configuration file.

     owner:group
             This optional field specifies the owner and group for the archive
             file.  The ‘:’ is essential regardless if the owner or group field
             is left blank or contains a value.  The field may be numeric, or a
             name which is present in /etc/passwd or /etc/group.  By default,
             log files are owned by root:admin.

     mode    Specify the file mode of the log file and archives.

     count   Specify the maximum number of archive files which may exist.  This
             does not consider the current log file.

     size    When the size of the log file reaches size in kilobytes, the log
             file will be trimmed as described above.  If this field contains an
             asterisk (‘*’), the log file will not be trimmed based on size.

     when    The when field may consist of an interval, a specific time, or
             both.  If the when field contains an asterisk (‘*’), log rotation
             will solely depend on the contents of the size field.  Otherwise,
             the when field consists of an optional interval in hours, usually
             followed by an ‘@’-sign and a time in restricted ISO 8601 format.
             Additionally, the format may also be constructed with a ‘$’ sign
             along with a rotation time specification of once a day, once a
             week, or once a month.

             If a time is specified, the log file will only be trimmed if
             newsyslog(8) is run within one hour of the specified time.  If an
             interval is specified, the log file will be trimmed if that many
             hours have passed since the last rotation.  When both a time and an
             interval are specified then both conditions must be satisfied for
             the rotation to take place.

             There is no provision for the specification of a timezone.  There
             is little point in specifying an explicit minutes or seconds
             component in the current implementation, since the only comparison
             is “within the hour”.

             ISO 8601 restricted time format:

             The lead-in character for a restricted ISO 8601 time is an ‘@’
             sign.  The particular format of the time in restricted ISO 8601 is:
             [[[[[cc]yy]mm]dd][T[hh[mm[ss]]]]].  Optional date fields default to
             the appropriate component of the current date; optional time fields
             default to midnight; hence if today is January 22, 1999, the
             following date specifications are all equivalent:

                   ‘19990122T000000’
                   ‘990122T000000’
                   ‘0122T000000’
                   ‘22T000000’
                   ‘T000000’
                   ‘T0000’
                   ‘T00’
                   ‘22T’
                   ‘T’
                   ‘’

             Day, week, and month time format:

             The lead-in character for day, week, and month specification is a
             ‘$’ sign.  The particular format of day, week, and month
             specification is: [Dhh], [Ww[Dhh]], and [Mdd[Dhh]], respectively.
             Optional time fields default to midnight.  The ranges for day and
             hour specifications are:

                   hh      hours, range 0..23
                   w       day of week, range 0..6, 0 = Sunday
                   dd      day of month, range 1..31, or one of the letters ‘L’
                           or ‘l’ to specify the last day of the month.

             Some examples:

                   $D0     rotate every night at midnight (same as @T00)
                   $D23    rotate every day at 23:00 (same as @T23)
                   $W0D23  rotate every week on Sunday at 23:00
                   $W5D16  rotate every week on Friday at 16:00
                   $M1D0   rotate at the first day of every month at midnight
                           (i.e., the start of the day; same as @01T00)
                   $M5D6   rotate on every 5th day of month at 6:00 (same as
                           @05T06)

     flags   This optional field is made up of one or more characters that
             specify any special processing to be done for the log files matched
             by this line.  The following are valid flags:

             B       indicates that the log file is a binary file, or has some
                     special format.  Usually newsyslog(8) inserts an ASCII
                     message into a log file during rotation.  This message is
                     used to indicate when, and sometimes why the log file was
                     rotated.  If B is specified, then that informational
                     message will not be inserted into the log file.

             C       indicates that the log file should be created if it does
                     not already exist, and if the -C option was also specified
                     on the command line.

             D       indicates that newsyslog(8) should set the UF_NODUMP flag
                     when creating a new version of this log file.  This option
                     would affect how the dump(8) command treats the log file
                     when making a file system backup.

             G       indicates that the specified logfile_name is a shell
                     pattern, and that newsyslog(8) should archive all filenames
                     matching that pattern using the other options on this line.
                     See glob(3) for details on syntax and matching rules.

             J       indicates that newsyslog(8) should attempt to save disk
                     space by compressing the rotated log file using bzip2(1).

             N       indicates that there is no process which needs to be
                     signaled when this log file is rotated.

             U       indicates that the file specified by path_to_pid_file will
                     contain the ID for a process group instead of a process.
                     This option also requires that the first line in that file
                     be a negative value to distinguish it from a process ID.

             Z       indicates that newsyslog(8) should attempt to save disk
                     space by compressing the rotated log file using gzip(1).

             -       a minus sign will not cause any special processing, but it
                     can be used as a placeholder to create a flags field when
                     you need to specify any of the following fields.

     path_to_pid_file
             This optional field specifies the file name containing a daemon's
             process ID or to find a group process ID if the U flag was
             specified.  If this field is present, a signal_number is sent the
             process ID contained in this file.  If this field is not present,
             then a SIGHUP signal will be sent to syslogd(8), unless the N flag
             has been specified.  This field must start with ‘/’ in order to be
             recognized properly.

     signal_number
             This optional field specifies the signal number that will be sent
             to the daemon process (or to all processes in a process group, if
             the U flag was specified).  If this field is not present, then a
             SIGHUP signal will be sent.
