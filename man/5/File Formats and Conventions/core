CORE(5)                        File Formats Manual                       CORE(5)

NAME
     core – memory image file format

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>

DESCRIPTION
     A small number of signals which cause abnormal termination of a process
     also cause a record of the process's in-core state to be written to disk
     for later examination by one of the available debuggers.  (See
     sigaction(2).) This memory image is written to a file named by default
     core.pid, where pid is the process ID of the process, in the /cores
     directory, provided the terminated process had write permission in the
     directory, and the directory existed.

     The maximum size of a core file is limited by setrlimit(2).  Files which
     would be larger than the limit are not created.

     The core file consists of the Mach-O(5) header as  described in the
     ⟨mach-o/loader.h⟩ file.  The remainder of the core file consists of various
     sections described in the Mach-O(5) header.

NOTE
     Core dumps are disabled by default under Darwin/macOS.  To re-enable core
     dumps, do one of the following

     * For subsequent processes spawned by launchd and their child processes, a
     privileged user can issue the command

           # launchctl limit core unlimited

     * For susequent processes spawned by a shell, use ulimit(1) or limit(1)
     depending upon the shell.

           % ulimit -c unlimited
     or

           % limit coredumpsize unlimited

     To disable core dumps, set the limit to 0 using one of the aforementioned
     ways.
