NAME
       texinfo - software documentation system

DESCRIPTION
       Texinfo is a documentation system that uses a single source file to
       produce both online information and printed output.  It is primarily
       designed for writing software manuals.

       For a full description of the Texinfo language and associated tools,
       please see the Texinfo manual (written in Texinfo itself).  Most likely,
       running this command from your shell:
              info texinfo
       or this key sequence from inside Emacs:
              M-x info RET m texinfo RET
       will get you there.

AVAILABILITY
       ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo/
       or any GNU mirror site.

REPORTING BUGS
       Please send bug reports to bug-texinfo@gnu.org, general questions and
       discussion to help-texinfo@gnu.org.
