NAME
     gb2312 â€“ GB2312 encoding method for Chinese text

SYNOPSIS
     ENCODING "GB2312"

DESCRIPTION
     The GB2312 encoding implements GB 2312-1980, a PRC national standard for
     the encoding of simplified Chinese characters.

     Multibyte characters in the GB2312 encoding can be one byte or two bytes
     long.  GB 11383-1981 (ASCII) characters are represented by single bytes in
     the range 0x00 to 0x7F.  Simplified Chinese characters are represented by
     two bytes, both in the range 0xA1-0xFE.

SEE ALSO
     euc(5), gb18030(5), gbk(5)

STANDARDS
     The GB2312 encoding is believed to be compatible with GB 2312-1980.  This
     standard has been superseded by GB 18030-2000, but is still in wide use.
