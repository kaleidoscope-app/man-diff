NAME
       mime.types - mime type description file for cups

DESCRIPTION
       The mime.types file defines the recognized file types.

       Additional file types are specified in files with the extension .types in
       the CUPS configuration directory.

       Each line in the mime.types file is a comment, blank, or rule line.
       Comment lines start with the # character.  Rule lines start with the MIME
       media type and are optionally followed by a series of file recognition
       rules:

           mime/type [ rule ... rule ]

       Rules can be extended over multiple lines using the backslash character
       (\):

           mime/type [ really-really-really-long-rule ... \
             rule ]

       MIME media types specified by the mime/type field are case-insensitive
       and are sorted in ascending alphanumeric order for the purposes of
       matching.  See the "TYPE MATCHING AND PRIORITY" section for more
       information.

       The rules may be grouped using parenthesis, joined using "+" for a
       logical AND, joined using "," or whitespace for a logical OR, and negated
       using "!".

   RULES
       Rules take two forms - a filename extension by itself and functions with
       test values inside parenthesis.  The following functions are available:

       match("pattern")
            True if the filename matches the given shell wildcard pattern.

       ascii(offset,length)
            True if the length bytes starting at offset are valid printable
            ASCII (CR, NL, TAB, BS, 32-126).

       printable(offset,length)
            True if the length bytes starting at offset are printable 8-bit
            chars (CR, NL, TAB, BS, 32-126, 128-254).

       priority(number)
            Specifies the relative priority of this MIME media type.  The
            default priority is 100.  Larger values have higher priority while
            smaller values have lower priority.

       string(offset,"string")
            True if the bytes starting at offset are identical to string.

       istring(offset,"string")
            True if the bytes starting at offset match string without respect to
            case.

       char(offset,value)
            True if the byte at offset is identical to value.

       short(offset,value)
            True if the 16-bit big-endian integer at offset is identical to
            value.

       int(offset,value)
            True if the 32-bit big-endian integer at offset is identical to
            value.

       locale("string")
            True if current locale matches string.

       contains(offset,range,"string")
            True if the bytes starting at offset for range bytes contains
            string.

   STRING CONSTANTS
       String constants can be specified inside quotes ("") for strings
       containing whitespace and angle brackets (<>) for hexadecimal strings.

   TYPE MATCHING AND PRIORITY
       When CUPS needs to determine the MIME media type of a given file, it
       checks every MIME media type defined in the .types files.  When two or
       more types match a given file, the type chosen will depend on the type
       name and priority, with higher-priority types being used over lower-
       priority ones.  If the types have the same priority, the type names are
       sorted alphanumerically in ascending order and the first type is chosen.

       For example, if two types "text/bar" and "text/foo" are defined as
       matching the extension "doc", normally the type "text/bar" will be chosen
       since its name is alphanumerically smaller than "text/foo".  However, if
       "text/foo" also defines a higher priority than "text/bar", "text/foo"
       will be chosen instead.

FILES
       /etc/cups - Typical CUPS configuration directory.

EXAMPLES
       Define two MIME media types for raster data, with one being a subset with
       higher priority:

           application/vnd.cups-raster  string(0,"RaSt") string(0,"tSaR") \
                                         string(0,"RaS2") string(0,"2SaR") \
                                         string(0,"RaS3") string(0,"3SaR")

           image/pwg-raster              string(0,"RaS2") + \
                                         string(4,PwgRaster<00>) priority(150)
