BOM(5)                         File Formats Manual                        BOM(5)

NAME
     bom â€“ bill of materials

DESCRIPTION
     The Mac OS X Installer uses a file system "bill of materials" to determine
     which files to install, remove, or upgrade. A bill of materials, bom,
     contains all the files within a directory, along with some information
     about each file. File information includes: the file's UNIX permissions,
     its owner and group, its size, its time of last modification, and so on.
     Also included are a checksum of each file and information about hard links.

     The bill of materials for installed packages are found within the package
     receipts located in /Library/Receipts.

     ditto(1), lsbom(8), mkbom(8)

BUGS
     Mac OS X's bill of materials format is not compatible with formats from
     older operating systems.

HISTORY
     The bill of materials file appeared in NeXTSTEP to support installation.
     The file format was updated and extended for Mac OS X 10.0.  The format was
     extended to support 64 bit file sizes with OS X 10.3.
