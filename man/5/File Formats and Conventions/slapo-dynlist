SLAPO-DYNLIST(5)               File Formats Manual              SLAPO-DYNLIST(5)



NAME
       slapo-dynlist - Dynamic List overlay to slapd

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The dynlist overlay to slapd(8) allows expansion of dynamic groups and
       more.  Any time an entry with a specific objectClass is being returned,
       the LDAP URI-valued occurrences of a specific attribute are expanded into
       the corresponding entries, and the values of the attributes listed in the
       URI are added to the original entry.  No recursion is allowed, to avoid
       potential infinite loops.  The resulting entry must comply with the LDAP
       data model, so constraints are enforced.  For example, if a SINGLE-VALUE
       attribute is listed, only the first value results in the final entry.
       The above described behavior is disabled when the manageDSAit control
       (RFC 3296) is used.  In that case, the contents of the dynamic group
       entry is returned; namely, the URLs are returned instead of being
       expanded.


CONFIGURATION
       The config directives that are specific to the dynlist overlay must be
       prefixed by dynlist-, to avoid potential conflicts with directives
       specific to the underlying database or to other stacked overlays.


       overlay dynlist
              This directive adds the dynlist overlay to the current database,
              or to the frontend, if used before any database instantiation; see
              slapd.conf(5) for details.


       This slapd.conf configuration option is defined for the dynlist overlay.
       It may have multiple occurrences, and it must appear after the overlay
       directive.

       dynlist-attrset <group-oc> [<URI>] <URL-ad> [[<mapped-ad>:]<member-ad>
       ...]   The value group-oc is the name of the objectClass that triggers
              the dynamic expansion of the data.

              The optional URI restricts expansion only to entries matching the
              DN, the scope and the filter portions of the URI.

              The value URL-ad is the name of the attributeDescription that
              contains the URI that is expanded by the overlay; if none is
              present, no expansion occurs.  If the intersection of the
              attributes requested by the search operation (or the asserted
              attribute for compares) and the attributes listed in the URI is
              empty, no expansion occurs for that specific URI.  It must be a
              subtype of labeledURI.

              The value member-ad is optional; if present, the overlay behaves
              as a dynamic group: this attribute will list the DN of the entries
              resulting from the internal search.  In this case, the attrs
              portion of the URIs in the URL-ad attribute must be absent, and
              the DNs of all the entries resulting from the expansion of the
              URIs are listed as values of this attribute.  Compares that assert
              the value of the member-ad attribute of entries with group-oc
              objectClass apply as if the DN of the entries resulting from the
              expansion of the URI were present in the group-oc entry as values
              of the member-ad attribute.

              Alternatively, mapped-ad can be used to remap attributes obtained
              through expansion.  member-ad attributes are not filled by
              expanded DN, but are remapped as mapped-ad attributes.  Multiple
              mapping statements can be used.


       The dynlist overlay may be used with any backend, but it is mainly
       intended for use with local storage backends.  In case the URI expansion
       is very resource-intensive and occurs frequently with well-defined
       patterns, one should consider adding a proxycache later on in the overlay
       stack.


AUTHORIZATION
       By default the expansions are performed using the identity of the current
       LDAP user.  This identity may be overridden by setting the dgIdentity
       attribute in the group's entry to the DN of another LDAP user.  In that
       case the dgIdentity will be used when expanding the URIs in the object.
       Setting the dgIdentity to a zero-length string will cause the expansions
       to be performed anonymously.  Note that the dgIdentity attribute is
       defined in the dyngroup schema, and this schema must be loaded before the
       dgIdentity authorization feature may be used.  If the dgAuthz attribute
       is also present in the group's entry, its values are used to determine
       what identities are authorized to use the dgIdentity to expand the group.
       Values of the dgAuthz attribute must conform to the (experimental)
       OpenLDAP authz syntax.


EXAMPLE
       This example collects all the email addresses of a database into a single
       entry; first of all, make sure that slapd.conf contains the directives:


           include /path/to/dyngroup.schema
           # ...

           database <database>
           # ...

           overlay dynlist
           dynlist-attrset groupOfURLs memberURL

       and that slapd loads dynlist.la, if compiled as a run-time module; then
       add to the database an entry like

           dn: cn=Dynamic List,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com
           objectClass: groupOfURLs
           cn: Dynamic List
           memberURL: ldap:///ou=People,dc=example,dc=com?mail?sub?(objectClass=person)

       If no <attrs> are provided in the URI, all (non-operational) attributes
       are collected.

       This example implements the dynamic group feature on the member
       attribute:


           include /path/to/dyngroup.schema
           # ...

           database <database>
           # ...

           overlay dynlist
           dynlist-attrset groupOfURLs memberURL member

       A dynamic group with dgIdentity authorization could be created with an
       entry like

           dn: cn=Dynamic Group,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com
           objectClass: groupOfURLs
           objectClass: dgIdentityAux
           cn: Dynamic Group
           memberURL: ldap:///ou=People,dc=example,dc=com??sub?(objectClass=person)
           dgIdentity: cn=Group Proxy,ou=Services,dc=example,dc=com
