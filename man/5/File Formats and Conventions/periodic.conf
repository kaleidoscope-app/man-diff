PERIODIC.CONF(5)               File Formats Manual              PERIODIC.CONF(5)

NAME
     periodic.conf – periodic job configuration information

DESCRIPTION
     The file periodic.conf contains a description of how daily, weekly and
     monthly system maintenance jobs should run.  It resides in the
     /etc/defaults directory and parts may be overridden by a file of the same
     name in /etc, which itself may be overridden by the
     /etc/periodic.conf.local file.

     The periodic.conf file is actually sourced as a shell script from each of
     the periodic scripts and is intended to simply provide default
     configuration variables.

     The following variables are used by periodic(8) itself:

         local_periodic
             (str) List of directories to search for periodic scripts.  This
             list is always prefixed with /etc/periodic, and is only used when
             an argument to periodic(8) is not an absolute directory name.

         ⟨dir⟩_output
             (path or list) What to do with the output of the scripts executed
             from the directory dir.  If this variable is set to an absolute
             path name, output is logged to that file, otherwise it is taken as
             one or more space separated email addresses and mailed to those
             users.  If this variable is not set or is empty, output is sent to
             standard output.

             For an unattended machine, suitable values for daily_output,
             weekly_output, and monthly_output might be “/var/log/daily.log”,
             “/var/log/weekly.log”, and “/var/log/monthly.log” respectively, as
             newsyslog(8) will rotate these files (if they exists) at the
             appropriate times.

         ⟨dir⟩_show_success

         ⟨dir⟩_show_info

         ⟨dir⟩_show_badconfig
             (bool) These variables control whether periodic(8) will mask the
             output of the executed scripts based on their return code (where
             dir is the base directory name in which each script resides).  If
             the return code of a script is ‘0’ and ⟨dir⟩_show_success is set to
             “NO”, periodic(8) will mask the script's output.  If the return
             code of a script is ‘1’ and ⟨dir⟩_show_info is set to “NO”,
             periodic(8) will mask the script's output.  If the return code of a
             script is ‘2’ and ⟨dir⟩_show_badconfig is set to “NO”, periodic(8)
             will mask the script's output.  If these variables are set to
             neither “YES” nor “NO”, they default to “YES”, “YES” and “NO”
             respectively.

             Refer to the periodic(8) manual page for how script return codes
             are interpreted.

     The following variables are used by the standard scripts that reside in
     /etc/periodic/daily:

         daily_clean_tmps_enable
             (bool) Set to “YES” if you want to clear temporary directories
             daily.

         daily_clean_tmps_dirs
             (str) Set to the list of directories to clear if
             daily_clean_tmps_enable is set to “YES”.

         daily_clean_tmps_days
             (num) When daily_clean_tmps_enable is set, this must also be set to
             the number of days old that a file's access and modification times
             must be before it is deleted.

         daily_clean_tmps_ignore
             (str) Set to the list of files that should not be deleted when
             daily_clean_tmps_enable is set to “YES”.  Wild card characters are
             permitted.

         daily_clean_tmps_verbose
             (bool) Set to “YES” if you want the removed files to be reported in
             your daily output.

         daily_local
             (str) Set to a list of extra scripts that should be run after all
             other daily scripts.  All scripts must be absolute path names.

     The following variables are used by the standard scripts that reside in
     /etc/periodic/weekly:

         weekly_local
             (str) Set to a list of extra scripts that should be run after all
             other weekly scripts.  All scripts must be absolute path names.

     The following variables are used by the standard scripts that reside in
     /etc/periodic/monthly:

         monthly_local
             (str) Set to a list of extra scripts that should be run after all
             other monthly scripts.  All scripts must be absolute path names.

FILES
     /etc/defaults/periodic.conf      The default configuration file.  This file
                                      contains all default variables and values.

     /etc/periodic.conf               The usual system specific variable
                                      override file.

     /etc/periodic.conf.local         An additional override file, useful when
                                      /etc/periodic.conf is shared or
                                      distributed.
