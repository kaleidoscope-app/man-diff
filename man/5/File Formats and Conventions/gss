NAME
     gss â€“ how to configure gss framework

DESCRIPTION
     The gss GSS.frameworks have several configuration domains, all can
     configured with defaults(1).

     Configuration can be stored both in the user's configuration (
     ~/Library/Preferences) and system ( /Library/Preferences ).

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
     Use gsstool(1) to list the supported options and their settings:
           gsstool supported-mech --options

     Common options are:

     NTLM 'Force NTLMv1'
             Force client to use NTLMv1

     NTLM NTLMv1
             Enable support for NTLMv1 in both client and server

     NTLM NTLMv2
             Enable support for NTLMv2 in both client and server

     NTLM 'NTLM session key'
             Require backends to support for NTLMv2 session key, Lion and
             earlier dont support this.  Session keys is required for NTLM MIC
             that stops reflection attacks.

     NTLM 'AllowedHosts'
             What hosts that NTLM is allowed to be used for. When there a host
             that is not on the list, NTLM will not be used. File globbing is
             used when matching and it's case insensitive.  When there is no
             configuration, all hosts are allowed.

             defaults write com.apple.GSS.NTLM AllowedHosts -array host.local '*.my.domain'

NTLM options
     If you want to disable NTLM support completely in both the acceptor
     (server) and initiator (client), you need disable both NTLMv1 and NTLMv2,
     and set their values to boolean false or 0.

     defaults write com.apple.GSS.NTLM NTLMv1 -bool false
     defaults write com.apple.GSS.NTLM NTLMv2 -bool false

APPLE MAC OS X
     You can use the defaults write command to change the options, for simple
     boolean options, use this:
           defaults write com.apple.GSS.NTLM NTLMv1 -bool false

     You can also turn on debugging (output in syslog) using:
           defaults write com.apple.GSS DebugLevel -int 10
           open -a Console
