UUENCODE(5)                    File Formats Manual                   UUENCODE(5)

NAME
     uuencode – format of an encoded uuencode file

DESCRIPTION
     Files output by uuencode(1) consist of a header line, followed by a number
     of body lines, and a trailer line.  The uudecode(1) command will ignore any
     lines preceding the header or following the trailer.  Lines preceding a
     header must not, of course, look like a header.

     The header line is distinguished by having the first 6 characters “begin ”
     (note the trailing space).  The word begin is followed by a mode (in
     octal), and a string which names the remote file.  A space separates the
     three items in the header line.

     The body consists of a number of lines, each at most 62 characters long
     (including the trailing newline).  These consist of a character count,
     followed by encoded characters, followed by a newline.  The character count
     is a single printing character, and represents an integer, the number of
     bytes the rest of the line represents.  Such integers are always in the
     range from 1 to 45 or 64 and can be determined by subtracting the character
     space (octal 40) from the character.  Character 64 represents a count of
     zero.

     Groups of 3 bytes are stored in 4 characters, 6 bits per character.  All
     characters are always in range from 1 to 64 and are offset by a space
     (octal 40) to make the characters printing.  Character 64 represents a
     count of zero.  The last line may be shorter than the normal 45 bytes.  If
     the size is not a multiple of 3, this fact can be determined by the value
     of the count on the last line.  Extra null characters will be included to
     make the character count a multiple of 4.  The body is terminated by a line
     with a count of zero.  This line consists of one ASCII backquote (octal
     140) character.

     The trailer line consists of “end” on a line by itself.
