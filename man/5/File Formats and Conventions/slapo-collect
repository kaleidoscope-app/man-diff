SLAPO-COLLECT(5)               File Formats Manual              SLAPO-COLLECT(5)



NAME
       slapo-collect - Collective attributes overlay to slapd

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The collect overlay is used to provide a relatively coarse implementation
       of RFC 3671 collective attributes.  In X.500, a collective attribute is
       "a user attribute whose values are the same for each member of an entry
       collection".

       Collective attributes are added to entries returned by a search operation
       when the entry is within the scope of the related ancestor.  Collective
       attributes can only be modified when the modification affects the related
       ancestor.


CONFIGURATION
       This slapd.conf option applies to the collect overlay.  It should appear
       after the overlay directive.

       collectinfo <DN> <attrlist>
              Specify the DN of the ancestor entry and the set of related
              collective attributes, where attrlist is a comma-separated list of
              attributes.  The DN should be within the naming context of the
              database.
