client.conf(5)                     Apple Inc.                     client.conf(5)



NAME
       client.conf - client configuration file for cups (deprecated on macos)

DESCRIPTION
       The client.conf file configures the CUPS client and is normally located
       in the /etc/cups and/or ~/.cups directories.  Each line in the file can
       be a configuration directive, a blank line, or a comment. Comment lines
       start with the # character.

       Note: Starting with macOS 10.7, this file is only used by command-line
       and X11 applications plus the IPP backend.  The ServerName directive is
       not supported on macOS at all.  Starting with macOS 10.12, all
       applications can access these settings in the
       /Library/Preferences/org.cups.PrintingPrefs.plist file instead.  See the
       NOTES section below for more information.

   DIRECTIVES
       The following directives are understood by the client. Consult the online
       help for detailed descriptions:

       AllowAnyRoot Yes

       AllowAnyRoot No
            Specifies whether to allow TLS with certificates that have not been
            signed by a trusted Certificate Authority.  The default is "Yes".

       AllowExpiredCerts Yes

       AllowExpiredCerts No
            Specifies whether to allow TLS with expired certificates.  The
            default is "No".

       DigestOptions DenyMD5

       DigestOptions None
            Specifies HTTP Digest authentication options.  DenyMD5 disables
            support for the original MD5 hash algorithm.

       Encryption IfRequested

       Encryption Never

       Encryption Required
            Specifies the level of encryption that should be used.

       GSSServiceName name
            Specifies the Kerberos service name that is used for authentication,
            typically "host", "http", or "ipp".  CUPS adds the remote hostname
            ("name@server.example.com") for you. The default name is "http".

       ServerName hostname-or-ip-address[:port]

       ServerName /domain/socket
            Specifies the address and optionally the port to use when connecting
            to the server.  Note: This directive is not supported on macOS 10.7
            or later.

       ServerName hostname-or-ip-address[:port]/version=1.1
            Specifies the address and optionally the port to use when connecting
            to a server running CUPS 1.3.12 and earlier.

       SSLOptions [AllowDH] [AllowRC4] [AllowSSL3] [DenyCBC] [DenyTLS1.0]
       [MaxTLS1.0] [MaxTLS1.1] [MaxTLS1.2] [MaxTLS1.3] [MinTLS1.0] [MinTLS1.1]
       [MinTLS1.2] [MinTLS1.3]

       SSLOptions None
            Sets encryption options (only in /etc/cups/client.conf).  By
            default, CUPS only supports encryption using TLS v1.0 or higher
            using known secure cipher suites.  Security is reduced when Allow
            options are used.  Security is enhanced when Deny options are used.
            The AllowDH option enables cipher suites using plain Diffie-Hellman
            key negotiation (not supported on systems using GNU TLS).  The
            AllowRC4 option enables the 128-bit RC4 cipher suites, which are
            required for some older clients.  The AllowSSL3 option enables SSL
            v3.0, which is required for some older clients that do not support
            TLS v1.0.  The DenyCBC option disables all CBC cipher suites.  The
            DenyTLS1.0 option disables TLS v1.0 support - this sets the minimum
            protocol version to TLS v1.1.  The MinTLS options set the minimum
            TLS version to support.  The MaxTLS options set the maximum TLS
            version to support.  Not all operating systems support TLS 1.3 at
            this time.

       TrustOnFirstUse Yes

       TrustOnFirstUse No
            Specifies whether to trust new TLS certificates by default.  The
            default is "Yes".

       User name
            Specifies the default user name to use for requests.

       UserAgentTokens None

       UserAgentTokens ProductOnly

       UserAgentTokens Major

       UserAgentTokens Minor

       UserAgentTokens Minimal

       UserAgentTokens OS

       UserAgentTokens Full
            Specifies what information is included in the User-Agent header of
            HTTP requests.  "None" disables the User-Agent header.
            "ProductOnly" reports "CUPS".  "Major" reports "CUPS/major IPP/2".
            "Minor" reports "CUPS/major.minor IPP/2.1".  "Minimal" reports
            "CUPS/major.minor.patch IPP/2.1".  "OS" reports
            "CUPS/major.minor.path (osname osversion) IPP/2.1".  "Full" reports
            "CUPS/major.minor.path (osname osversion; architecture) IPP/2.1".
            The default is "Minimal".

       ValidateCerts Yes

       ValidateCerts No
            Specifies whether to only allow TLS with certificates whose common
            name matches the hostname.  The default is "No".

NOTES
       The client.conf file is deprecated on macOS and will no longer be
       supported in a future version of CUPS.  Configuration settings can
       instead be viewed or changed using the defaults(1) command:
       defaults write /Library/Preferences/org.cups.PrintingPrefs.plist Encryption Required
       defaults write /Library/Preferences/org.cups.PrintingPrefs.plist TrustOnFirstUse -bool NO

       defaults read /Library/Preferences/org.cups.PrintingPrefs.plist Encryption
       On Linux and other systems using GNU TLS, the /etc/cups/ssl/site.crl
       file, if present, provides a list of revoked X.509 certificates and is
       used when validating certificates.
