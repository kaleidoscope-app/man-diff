ASL.CONF(5)                    File Formats Manual                   ASL.CONF(5)

NAME
     asl.conf – configuration file for syslogd(8) and aslmanager(8)

DESCRIPTION
     The syslogd(8) server reads the /etc/asl.conf file at startup, and re-reads
     the file when it receives a HUP signal.  The aslmanager(8) daemon reads the
     file when it starts.  See the ASLMANAGER PARAMETER SETTINGS section for
     details on aslmanager-specific parameters.

     If the /etc/asl directory exists, then syslogd and aslmanager will read
     each file it contains.  These files must have the same format as asl.conf.
     Each file configures an independent module, identified by the file name.
     Modules may be enabled or disabled independently.  Each module may specify
     its own set of rules for acting on received messages.  See the ASL MODULES
     section for details.

     The files contain several types of lines, described below.  Each type is
     identified by the first non-whitespace character in the line.

     =  Parameter settings
     ?  Query-action rules
     >  Output file or directory configuration options
     #  Comments

     Parameter setting lines in the configuration file are generally of the
     form:

           = parameter_name value ...

     Most parameter settings require a single value, although some may take
     several values.  See the PARAMETER SETTINGS section for details.

     Query-action rules in the file generally have the form:

           ? query action ...

     This directs syslogd to perform the specified action when a received
     message matches the given query.  Actions may be followed by optional
     arguments.  See the QUERY-ACTION RULES section for details.

     Most query-action rules specify output files or ASL-format data stores
     where matching messages should be saved.  The optional parameters for those
     rules can specify a number of options for these outputs.  As a convenience,
     these configuration options may be specified on a separate line.  Output
     configuration settings in the file begin with a greater-than sign “>”
     followed by a file or ASL directory name and the configuration options for
     that file or directory.  These lines generally have the form:

           > filename option ...

     See the OUTPUT CONFIGURATION SETTINGS section for details.

     Comment lines are ignored.

   PARAMETER SETTINGS
     The following parameter-settings are recognized by syslogd.

           debug             Enables or disables internal debugging output.
                             This is probably of little interest to most users.
                             The debug parameter requires a value of “1” to
                             enable debug output, or a value of “0” to disable
                             it.  Debugging messages are written to
                             /var/log/syslogd.log.

           mark_time         Sets the time interval for the mark facility.  The
                             default is 0 seconds, which indicates that mark
                             messages are not generated.

           dup_delay         Sets the maximum time before writing a “last
                             message repeated <N> times” message in a log file
                             when duplicate messages have been detected.  The
                             default is 30 seconds.

           utmp_ttl          Sets the time-to-live for messages used by the
                             utmp, wtmp, and lastlog subsystems.  The default is
                             31622400 seconds (approximately 1 year).

           mps_limit         Sets the kernel message per second quota.  The
                             default is value is 500.  A value of 0 disables the
                             quota mechanism.  Note that this setting only
                             limits the number of kernel messages that will be
                             saved by syslogd.  User processes are limited to
                             36000 messages per hour.  The limit for a user
                             process is not enforced if a remote-control ASL
                             filter is in place for the process.  See the
                             syslog(1) manual for enabling a remote-control
                             filter using the -c option with the syslog command.

           max_file_size     Sets the maximum file size for individual files in
                             the ASL database.  The default is 25600000 bytes.

   QUERY-ACTION RULES
     Query-action rules are used to cause syslogd to perform specific actions
     when received messages match a specified query pattern.  For example, to
     save certain messages in a file.  The rules are processed in the order in
     which they appear in the file.  This matters because some actions can
     affect further processing.  For example, an “ignore” action causes syslogd
     to stop processing the rules in a file for messages that match a given
     query pattern.

     Query-action rules contain three components: a query, an action, and
     optional parameters specific to that action.  For example, the following
     rule matches log messages sent by the “example” process which have log
     priority levels in the range emergency to error.  If a received message
     matches, syslogd posts a BSD notification for the key
     “com.example.log_message”.

           ? [= Sender example] [<= Level error] notify com.example.log_message

   Query Format
     Queries comprise one or more message matching components, each of which has
     the form:

           [OP KEY VAL]

     OP is a comparison operator.  It can have the following values:

           T     true (always matches)
           =     equal
           !     not equal
           >     greater than
           >=    greater than or equal to
           <     less than
           <=    less than or equal to

     It can also be preceded by one or more modifiers:

           C     casefold
           N     numeric comparison
           S     substring
           A     prefix
           Z     suffix

     KEY and VAL are message keys and values.  For example

           [= Sender example]

     matches any message with value “example” for the “Sender” key.  The query

           [CA= Color gr]

     matches any message with a value beginning with the letters GR, Gr, gr, or
     gR ( “C” meaning casefold, “A” meaning prefix) for the “Color” key.  The
     example query above,

           [= Sender example] [N< Level 3]

     matches any message from “example” with a level numerically less than 3
     (string values are converted to integers, and the comparison is done on the
     integer values).  Note that the string values may be used equivalently for
     the Level key, so the example above may also be written as:

           [= Sender example] [< Level Error]

     String values for levels may be any of the set “emergency”, “alert”,
     “critical”, “error”, “warning”, “notice”, “info”, or “debug”.  These
     strings may be upper, lower, or mixed case.

     The “T” operator is useful to test for the presence of a particular key.

           [T Flavor]

     Will match any message that has a “Flavor” key, regardless of its value.

     Note that space characters and closing square bracket characters (']') are
     specially processed.  The first space character following the beginning of
     a key delimits the key.  The first closing square bracket following the
     beginning of a value delimits the value.  So '[= foo bar ]' will match
     messages which have a key 'foo' with the value 'bar ', including a trailing
     space character.

     As a special case, the query

           *

     matches all messages.

   Actions
     The following actions are available.

           store      Causes syslogd to save matching messages in the ASL
                      database.  Note that if /etc/asl.conf contains no “store”
                      action rules, then syslogd will save all messages it
                      receives in the ASL database.

           file       Causes matching messages to be stored in a log file.  The
                      file's path name must follow as the first parameter.  If
                      the path already exists, it must be a plain file.  If the
                      file does not exist, it will be created when the first
                      message is written.  If the pathname specified is not an
                      absolute path, syslogd will treat the given path as
                      relative to /var/log (for /etc/asl.conf), or for other
                      output modules relative to /var/log/module/NAME where NAME
                      is the module name.

                      By default, the file's owner will be root, and the file
                      will be readable by the admin group.  Various options may
                      follow the file name to specify ownership and access
                      controls, printed log message format, and controls for
                      file rotation, compression, time-to-live, and other
                      aspects of output file life-cycle management.  See the
                      OUTPUT CONFIGURATION SETTINGS section for more details.

           directory  Causes matching messages to be stored in an ASL-format log
                      message data store.  A directory path name must follow as
                      the first parameter.  If the path exists, it must be a
                      directory.

                      Messages saved to an ASL directory are saved in files that
                      are named “yyyy.mm.dd.asl”, where “yyyy”, “mm”, and “dd”
                      are the year, month (01 to 12) and day of the month (01 to
                      31) associated with matching messages.  This has the
                      effect of saving messages in a separate file for each day.

                      By default, files in the directory will be owned by root,
                      and readable by the admin group.  Various options may
                      follow the directory name to control ownership, access
                      controls, and the management of the store and its
                      contents.  See the OUTPUT CONFIGURATION SETTINGS section
                      for a list of options that may be set for store
                      directories.

           notify     Causes syslogd to post a notification with notify_post().
                      The notification key must appear as a single parameter
                      following the “notify” action.

           skip       Causes a matching message to be ignored in all subsequent
                      matching rules in the file.  Its scope is local to a
                      single module configuration file.

           claim      Messages that match the query associated with a “claim”
                      action are not processed by the main ASL configuration
                      file /etc/asl.conf.  While claimed messages are not
                      processed by /etc/asl.conf, they are not completely
                      private.  Other modules may also claim messages, and in
                      some cases two or more modules may have claim actions that
                      match the same messages.  This action only blocks
                      processing by /etc/asl.conf.

                      The “claim” action may be followed by the keyword “only”.
                      In this case, only those messages that match the “claim
                      only” query will be processed by subsequent rules in the
                      module.

           access     Sets read access controls for messages that match the
                      associated query pattern.  syslogd will restrict read
                      access to matching messages to a specific user and group.
                      The user ID number and group ID number must follow the
                      “access” keyword as parameters.

           broadcast  Causes syslogd to write the text of matching messages to
                      all terminal windows.  If optional text follows the
                      “broadcast” keyword, then that text is written rather that
                      the matching message text.  Note that this action is
                      restricted to the main ASL configuration file
                      /etc/asl.conf.

           ignore     Causes a matching message to be ignored in all subsequent
                      matching rules in the file.  This action is equivalent to
                      the “skip” action in all module configuration files except
                      the main ASL configuration file /etc/asl.conf.  When used
                      in the main configuration file, the scope of the action is
                      global, and matching messages will be ignored by all ASL
                      modules.

   OUTPUT CONFIGURATION SETTINGS
     Various options may follow the path name in a “file” or “directory” query-
     action rule.  For example, the following rule specifies that all messages
     from the “example” facility will be saved in the file “example.log”, and
     that messages are printed in a “raw” format that shows all the keys and
     values in the message:

           ? [= Facility example] file example.log format=raw

     Multiple options may be specified separated by whitespace characters.  For
     example:

           ? [= Facility example] file example.log format=raw rotate=local
           compress ttl=3 mode=0640 uid=0 gid=5 gid=20

     As a convenience, a file or directory name and any associated options can
     be specified on a separate output configuration line following a “>”
     character:

           > example.log format=raw rotate=local compress ttl=3 mode=0640 uid=0
           gid=5 gid=20

     Options for a file or directory are taken from the first query-action rule
     or output configuration line for the given path.  A good usage pattern for
     multiple rules that specify the same output file or directory is:

           > example.log options ...
           ? query1 file example.log
           ? query2 file example.log
           ? query3 file example.log

     Most of the options listed below may be used with either file or directory
     outputs.  Exceptions are noted.

           format=FMT    Controls the format of log messages saved in a file.
                         Note that this option is specific to file outputs.  It
                         is ignored for ASL directories.

                         The format is specified by the value given for FMT.
                         Several pre-defined formats are available:

                         bsd   Format used by the syslogd daemon for system log
                               files, e.g. /var/log/system.log.

                         std   Standard (default) format.  Similar to “bsd”, but
                               includes the message priority level.

                         raw   Prints the complete message structure.  Each
                               key/value pair is enclosed in square brackets.
                               Embedded closing brackets and white space are
                               escaped.  Time stamps are printed as seconds
                               since the epoch.

                         xml   The list of messages is printed as an XML
                               property list.  Each message is represented as a
                               dictionary in a array.  Dictionary keys represent
                               message keys.  Dictionary values are strings.

                         asl   The output file is written as an ASL-format data
                               store file.  Files in this format may be read and
                               searched using the syslog command line utility
                               with the use of the -f path option.

                         Custom format strings may also be specified.  Since
                         custom formats often contain white-space characters,
                         the entire string may be enclosed in single or double
                         quote characters, or each white-space character may be
                         preceded by a backslash escape character.  Escaped
                         characters are not interpreted.  Custom format strings
                         are described in detail in the READING MESSAGES section
                         of the syslog(1) manual.

           mode=MMM      Sets the mode of the file or files within an ASL
                         directory.  The value MMM may be specified as a decimal
                         value, a hexadecimal value (if preceded by ``0x''), or
                         octal value (if preceded by ``0'').

           uid=UUU       Specifies the file's owner.  If more than one “uid=UUU”
                         option is given, the first will be used to set
                         ownership, and subsequent user IDs will be given read
                         access to in the files POSIX.1e ACLs.  Note that UIDs
                         should be defined in the local Open Directory database,
                         since syslogd starts and may create the log file before
                         network directory services are available.  Unknown UIDs
                         and GIDs will be ignored when setting access controls.

           gid=GGG       Specifies the file's group.  If more than one “gid=GGG”
                         option is given, the first will be used to set the
                         file's group, and subsequent group IDs will be given
                         read access to in the files POSIX.1e ACLs.  As with
                         UID=UUU options, groups should be defined in the local
                         Open Directory database.

           coalesce=VAL  By default, files printed using the “bsd” and “std”
                         formats will coalesce duplicates.  If two or more
                         messages are logged within 30 seconds, and which differ
                         only in time, then the second and subsequent messages
                         will not be printed.  When a different message is
                         logged, or 30 seconds have elapsed since the initial
                         message was logged, a line with the text
                               --- last message repeated N times ---
                         will be added to the file.  The default is
                         “coalesce=1”.  The default may be overridden by
                         specifying “coalesce=0”.  The values “off” and “false”
                         may be used in place of “0”.

     The following options all deal with file rotation and life-cycle
     management.  The FILE ROTATION section describes this in detail.

           rotate=NAME_STYLE  Enables log file rotation and specifies the file
                              naming scheme for rotated files.  This option does
                              not apply to ASL directories.  NAME_STYLE may
                              either be a simple time-stamp style: “sec”, “utc”,
                              “utc-basic”, “local”, “local-basic”, or “seq”; or
                              the value may contain the file's base name, a file
                              name extension, and one of the time-stame styles.
                              For example “example.seq.log” or
                              “example.log.utc-basic.” A detailed description of
                              name styles may be found in the FILE ROTATION
                              section below.

                              If the option “rotate” appears without a value,
                              the naming style defaults to “sec”.

           ttl=DAYS           Specifies the number of days that older versions
                              of rotated files should be allowed to remain in
                              the filesystem.  Rotated files older than this
                              limit are deleted.

           dest=PATH          By default, rotated files are left in the same
                              directory as the original file.  However, in some
                              cases it may be useful to move the rotated
                              versions to a different directory for archival or
                              other reasons.  If this option is specified,
                              aslmanager will move files to the directory given
                              by PATH.

           soft               Makes syslogd ignore write errors when saving
                              messages.  Normally, syslogd will stop saving to a
                              file or ASL directory after 5 consecutive write
                              errors.

           compress           Enables gzip file compression for rotated log
                              files.  When compressed, the extension “.gz” is
                              appended to the file name.  When the output is an
                              ASL directory, data files are compressed after
                              midnight local time.  This means that messages
                              written in the current day will be readable using
                              syslog -d or using the asl(3) API.  Messages in
                              compressed data files will not be available until
                              the files are un-compressed.

           file_max=SIZE      Limits the size of an active log file.  SIZE may
                              be an integer number of bytes, or the value may be
                              followed by a single character “k”, “m”, or “g”
                              (upper or lower case), to indicate a size limit in
                              multiples of 1024 (kibibyte), 1048576 (mebibyte),
                              or 1073741824 (gibibyte).  If a file exceeds this
                              limit, it is immediately checkpointed by syslogd
                              and a new file is opened.  Note that “file_max”
                              specifies a size limit before file compression is
                              performed if the “compress” option is also
                              present.

           all_max=SIZE       Specifies a size limit for the total of all
                              rotated versions of a file.  aslmanager will
                              delete rotated files, oldest first, to reduce the
                              total below the limit.  SIZE may be specified in
                              the same format as the file_max option.

           basestamp          Causes syslogd to add a timestamp to the file name
                              when it is created.  For example,

                              > example.log rotate=utc-basic basestamp

                              will result in syslogd writing to, e.g.
                              “example.log.20120625T070000Z” rather than to
                              “example.log”.  Note that this option does nothing
                              with sequenced (``seq'') files.

           symlink            This option may only be used together with the
                              basestamp option.  It causes syslogd to create a
                              symlink with the unstamped file name to the
                              currently active log file.  For example,

                              > example.log rotate=sec basestamp symlink

                              will result in syslogd writing to, e.g.
                              “example.log.T1340607600”, and creating a sybolic
                              link from “example.log” to the active file.

   FILE ROTATION
     syslogd and aslmanager work together to provide the features of file
     rotation.  This section describes the file rotation options that may be
     used in /etc/asl.conf or an ASL Output Module configuration file, together
     with a description of how the system works to support those features.

     File rotation or file rolling is enabled by the “rotate” output
     configuration option.  It is typically specificed with a value which
     specifies the naming sytle for rotated files.  Name styles may simply be a
     timestamp format, which is appended to the filename.

           sec          Rotated file names are of the form
                        “example.log.T1340607600”.  The file names include the
                        creation time of the file in seconds since the epoch.

           utc          Rotated file names are in ISO 8601 extended format, for
                        example “example.log.2012-06-24T07:00:00Z”.  The file
                        names includes its creation time as a UTC date and time.

           utc-basic    Rotated file names are in ISO 8601 basic format, for
                        example “example.log.20120624T070000Z”.  The file names
                        includes its creation time as a UTC date and time.

           local        Rotated file names are in ISO 8601 extended format, for
                        example “example.log.2012-06-24T07:00:00-7”.  The file
                        names includes its creation time as date and time in the
                        local time zone.  The local timezone offset is included
                        as a trailing part of the name.  The value “lcl” is an
                        alias for “local”.

           local-basic  Rotated file names are in ISO 8601 basic format, for
                        example “example.log.20120624T070000-07”.  The file
                        names includes its creation time as date and time in the
                        local time zone.  The local timezone offset is included
                        as a trailing part of the name.  The value “lcl-basic”
                        is an alias for “local-basic”.

           seq          Rotated file names are of the form “example.log.N” where
                        N is an integer sequence number.  Files are re-numbered
                        on each rotation so that the “0” file is the most
                        recent.

     Note that using the local timezone for timestamped files may cause odd
     behavior on highly mobile systems.  aslmanager will delete files after a
     specified time-to-live (see below).  The age of the file is determined by
     the file name.  If files are created in different timezones but saved with
     a non-absolute timestamp, the age calculation may result in some files
     being considered older or newer than they are in reality.

     Also note that sequenced files (using the “seq” style) will initially be
     checkpointed using a file name containing a timestamp in seconds.
     aslmanager will re-sequence the files when it scans for checkpoint files.

     Alternatively, the name style may be have two or three components.  The
     first component is the “base” name of the file, with no filename extension.
     The base name may be followed by a timestamp format and optionally by a
     filename extension, or the base name may be followed by an extension (the
     extension is optional) and a timestamp format.  These components must be
     separated by a dot character.

     For example, this output configuration line specifies that the output file
     “example.log” should be rotated to create the files “example.0.log”,
     “example.1.log”, and so on.

           > example.log rotate=example.seq.log

     If a file is marked for rotation, syslogd will close the file at the start
     of a new day or when the file exceeds its “file_max” size limit.  At that
     point, syslogd renames the file with the file's creation time included in
     its name (unless the basestamp option is present, in which case the file's
     creation time is already included in the filename) and starts a new file to
     continue logging.  This operation is called checkpointing the file.

     For example, syslogd might close “example.log” and rename it
     “example.log.T1340521200”, 1340521200 being the time that the file was
     created.  It would then start a new “example.log” file and use it until
     midnight, when the cycle would be repeated.

     Files are normally checkpointed at midnight.  If the system is sleeping or
     powered off, then files are checkpointed when the the first message of a
     new day (local time) is received.  Files are also checkpointed if they
     exceed a size limit specified by a file_max option, and they may be
     checkpointed manually through options provided by the syslog(1) and
     aslmanager(8) utilities.  The checkpointed file name always contains the
     file's creation time.  If the options for the file include “rotate=utc”
     then the timestamp will be a UTC date and time string.  “rotate=local”
     causes the timestamp to be the date and time in the current local timezone.
     Otherwise, the timestamp will be in seconds since the epoch.

     syslogd only performs the checkpointing operation.  It closes old files,
     moves them out of the way, and starts writing new files.  Most of the work
     of file rotation is done by the aslmanager(8) utility.  That includes
     moving files to a destination directory, compressing files, re-naming files
     according to one of the naming style options, deleting old files after they
     exceed their time-to-live, and checking file space usage.

     aslmanager normally runs once during system start-up, and once a day just
     after midnight.  It may also be triggered occasionally by syslogd, and it
     may be run manually.

     aslmanager scans for any checkpointed files created by syslogd and will
     rename the files (if required) to match the naming style specified by the
     “rotate=NAME_STYLE” option.  If “rotate=seq” is specified for a file,
     checkpointed files created by syslogd contain a timestamp in seconds.
     These files are renamed so that the file names contain a sequence number.
     The most recent version has the number “0”, and older versions have higher
     numbers.  For example:

           example.log.0
           example.log.1
           example.log.2
           ...

     As well as renaming files, aslmanager may perform other actions.  If the
     file has been given a “dest=PATH” option, the rotated versions of the file
     will be moved to the specified directory.  Files will be gzip compressed
     using the zlib(3) library if the “compress” option has been given.  If the
     total size of all the rotated versions of the file exceeds a value given in
     an “all_max” option, older versions of the rotated file will be deleted to
     keep the total below the specified limit.

     Although checkpoint and file rotation operations are normally done
     automatically, aslmanager supports an option that will trigger syslogd to
     checkpoint files before aslmanager starts its scan.  syslog also supports
     an option to force files to be checkpointed without running aslmanager.
     See the aslmanager(8) and syslog(1) manuals for details.

     Programmatically, an asl(3) message may be sent to syslogd to force it to
     checkpoint either a single file, or to checkpoint all files for a
     particular ASL module.  To checkpoint all files:

         const char *module_name;

         //TODO: set module_name
         asl_object_t ctl = asl_new(ASL_TYPE_MSG);
         asl_set(ctl, ASL_KEY_OPTION, "control");
         asl_log(NULL, ctl, ASL_LEVEL_NOTICE, "@ %s checkpoint", module_name);
         asl_release(ctl);

     To checkpoint just one file:

         const char *module_name;
         const char *file_name;

         //TODO: set module_name
         //TODO: set file_name
         asl_object_t ctl = asl_new(ASL_TYPE_MSG);
         asl_set(ctl, ASL_KEY_OPTION, "control");
         asl_log(NULL, ctl, ASL_LEVEL_NOTICE, "@ %s checkpoint %s", module_name,
     file_name);
         asl_release(ctl);

   ASL OUTPUT MODULES
     An ASL output module is created by a configuration file in the directory
     /etc/asl.  The file name is used as the module's name.  The format of the
     file is generally the same as asl.conf with a few exceptions.  Modules may
     not have parameter setting lines for the system parameters listed in the
     PARAMETER SETTINGS or ASLMANAGER PARAMETER SETTINGS sections, nor may they
     include “broadcast” query-action rules.

     Module configuration files are read by syslogd when it starts, and whenever
     it gets a HUP signal.  Messages received by syslogd are first processed
     according the the rules found in /etc/asl.conf (also known as the
     “com.apple.asl” module), then the message is processed by the rules from
     each module found in /etc/asl.

     An exception to this is that messages that match the query in a “claim”
     action rule in any module are not processed by the rules in /etc/asl.conf.

     ASL output modules are enabled by default, but a module may include a
     parameter setting:

           = enable 0

     The module is still loaded by syslogd, but the module will not save
     messages to files or directories, and will not post BSD notifications.

     Several mechanisms allow modules to be enabled or disabled dynamically.
     One mechanism allows the setting of the “enable” parameter to be based on
     the existence of a path in the filesystem, or on the value associated with
     a dictionary key in a property list file.  On iOS only, the value of a key
     in an installed configuration profile may be tested.

     To enable a module based on the existence of a file, the module may use:

           = enable [File /a/b/c]

     where “/a/b/c” may be any filesystem path.

     To enable a module based on the value of a dictionary key in a property
     list file,

           = enable [Plist /path/config.plist] [= SomeKey SomeValue]

     Any of the test operations described above in the QUERY-ACTION RULES
     section may also be used in testing key / value pairs.  Multiple operations
     are also allowed, for example:

           = enable [Plist /path/config.plist] [N>= DebugLevel 7] [S= Othervalue
           xyz]

     If the property list file does not exist, the test will evaluate to zero.
     The file may be in binary or xml format.  It may only contain a single
     dictionary object at its top level.  Only keys and values at the top level
     of the dictionary may be tested.  Values must be strings, integer values,
     doubles, UUIDs, dates, or booleans.  Boolean <true/> and <false/> values
     are converted to 1 and 0 respectively.  Values are converted into strings,
     and string comparisons are used unless unless an “N” modifier is specified
     with the test operator.

     On iOS, a module may test key / value pairs in a configuration profile
     using the same key / value tests that may be used for property list files.

           = enable [Profile name] [= Verbose 1]

     The profile name is the value of its DefaultsDomainName key.  The test will
     evaluate to zero if the profile is not installed.

     A module may be also enabled or disabled using syslog or by sending syslogd
     a special asl(3) control message.  Only the user “root” may enable or
     disable modules.

     A module may be enabled or disabled by sending an asl(3) message as shown
     in this example:

         int enable;
         const char *module_name;

         //TODO: set module_name
         //TODO: set enable to 0 or 1
         asl_object_t ctl = asl_new(ASL_TYPE_MSG);
         asl_set(ctl, ASL_KEY_OPTION, "control");
         asl_log(NULL, ctl, ASL_LEVEL_NOTICE, "@ %s enable %d", module_name,
     enable);
         asl_release(ctl);

     A control message may also be sent using syslog as the following example
     shows to disable a module named “com.apple.example”:

           sudo syslog -module com.apple.example enable 0

     A module may also enable or disable itself.  Although a module that is not
     enabled will not write or post notifications, it still will scan messages.
     The module may contain conditional parameter-setting rules like:

           = [= Color Green] enable 1
           = [= Color Red] enable 0

     This is similar to a query-action rule.  If a message received by syslogd
     matches the specified query, in this case having a Color key with the value
     Green or Red, then the enable parameter is set as specified.  So in this
     example, the module would be enabled and disabled whenever syslogd received
     a message containing the appropriate value for the “Color” key.

   ASLMANAGER PARAMETER SETTINGS
     The following parameter-settings are recognized by aslmanager.

           aslmanager_debug  Enables or disables internal debugging output.
                             This is probably of little interest to most users.
                             The debug parameter requires a value of “1” to
                             enable debug output, or a value of “0” to disable
                             it.  Debug messages are saved in an auxiliary file
                             attached to an ASL log message.  The file may be
                             inspected by opening the file attachement from the
                             Console utility.

           store_ttl         Sets the time-to-live in days for messages in the
                             ASL database.  The default is 7 days.

           max_store_size    Sets the maximum size for for the ASL database.
                             The default is 150000000 bytes.

           archive           Enables or disables archiving of the ASL database.
                             The archive parameter requires a value of “1” to
                             enable archiving, or a value of “0” to disable it.
                             An optional archive directory path may follow the
                             “0” or “1”.  If enabled, files removed from the ASL
                             database are moved to the archive directory.  The
                             default archive directory path is
                             /var/log/asl.archive.

           store_path        The ASL database path used by aslmanager.  The
                             default is /var/log/asl.  Note that this parameter
                             is ignored by syslogd.

           archive_mode      Files copied to the ASL database archive will be
                             given the specified access mode.  The default is
                             0400, so archive files will only be readable by
                             root.
