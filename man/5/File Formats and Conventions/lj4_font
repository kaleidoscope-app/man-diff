NAME
       lj4_font - groff fonts for use with devlj4

DESCRIPTION
       Nominally, all Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 4–series and newer printers have
       the same internal fonts: 45 scalable fonts and one bitmapped Lineprinter
       font.  The scalable fonts are available in sizes between 0.25 point and
       999.75 points, in 0.25-point increments; the Lineprinter font is
       available only in 8.5-point size.

       The LaserJet font files included with groff assume that all printers
       since the LaserJet 4 are identical.  There are some differences between
       fonts in the earlier and more recent printers, however.  The LaserJet 4
       printer used Agfa Intellifont technology for 35 of the internal scalable
       fonts; the remaining 10 scalable fonts were TrueType.  Beginning with the
       LaserJet 4000–series printers introduced in 1997, all scalable internal
       fonts have been TrueType.  The number of printable glyphs differs
       slightly between Intellifont and TrueType fonts (generally, the TrueType
       fonts include more glyphs), and there are some minor differences in glyph
       metrics.  Differences among printer models are described in the PCL 5
       Comparison Guide and the PCL 5 Comparison Guide Addendum (for printers
       introduced since approximately 2001).

       LaserJet printers reference a glyph by a combination of a 256-glyph
       symbol set and an index within that symbol set.  Many glyphs appear in
       more than one symbol set; all combinations of symbol set and index that
       reference the same glyph are equivalent.  For each glyph, hpftodit(1)
       searches a list of symbol sets, and selects the first set that contains
       the glyph.  The printing code generated by hpftodit(1) is an integer that
       encodes a numerical value for the symbol set in the high byte(s), and the
       index in the low byte.  See groff_font(5) for a complete description of
       the font file format; symbol sets are described in greater detail in the
       PCL 5 Printer Language Technical Reference Manual.

       Two of the scalable fonts, Symbol and Wingdings, are bound to 256-glyph
       symbol sets; the remaining scalable fonts, as well as the Lineprinter
       font, support numerous symbol sets, sufficient to enable printing of more
       than 600 glyphs.

       The metrics generated by hpftodit(1) assume that the DESC file contains
       values of 1200 for res and 6350 for unitwidth (or any combination (e.g.,
       2400 and 3175) for which res × unitwidth = 7620000).  Although HP PCL 5
       LaserJet printers support an internal resolution of 7200 units per inch,
       they use a 16-bit signed integer for cursor positioning; if devlj4 is to
       support U.S. ledger paper (11″ × 17″), the maximum usable resolution is
       32767 / 17, or 1927, units per inch, which rounds down to 1200 units per
       inch.  If the largest required paper size is less (e.g., 8.5″ × 11″ or
       A5), a greater resolution (and lesser unitwidth) can be specified.

LIMITATIONS
       Font metrics for Intellifont fonts were provided by Tagged Font Metric
       (TFM) files originally developed by Agfa/Compugraphic.  The TFM files
       provided for these fonts supported 600+ glyphs and contained extensive
       lists of kern pairs.

       To accommodate developers who had become accustomed to TFM files, HP also
       provided TFM files for the 10 TrueType fonts included in the LaserJet 4.
       The TFM files for TrueType fonts generally included less information than
       the Intellifont TFMs, supporting fewer glyphs, and in most cases,
       providing no kerning information.  By the time the LaserJet 4000 printer
       was introduced, most developers had migrated to other means of obtaining
       font metrics, and support for new TFM files was very limited.  The TFM
       files provided for the TrueType fonts in the LaserJet 4000 support only
       the Latin 2 (ISO 8859-2) symbol set, and include no kerning information;
       consequently, they are of little value for any but the most rudimentary
       documents.

       Because the Intellifont TFM files contain considerably more information,
       they generally are preferable to the TrueType TFM files even for use with
       the TrueType fonts in the newer printers.  The metrics for the TrueType
       fonts are very close, though not identical, to those for the earlier
       Intellifont fonts of the same names.  Although most output using the
       Intellifont metrics with the newer printers is quite acceptable, a few
       glyphs may fail to print as expected.  The differences in glyph metrics
       may be particularly noticeable with composite parentheses, brackets, and
       braces used by eqn(1).  A script, located in
       /usr/share/groff/1.19.2/font/devlj4/generate, can be used to adjust the
       metrics for these glyphs in the special font S for use with printers that
       have all TrueType fonts.

       At the time HP last supported TFM files, only Version 1 of the Unicode
       standard was available.  Consequently, many glyphs lacking assigned code
       points were assigned by HP to the Private Use Area (PUA).  Later versions
       of the Unicode standard included code points outside the PUA for many of
       these glyphs.  The HP-supplied TrueType TFM files use the PUA
       assignments; TFM files generated from more recent TrueType font files
       require the later Unicode values to access the same glyphs.
       Consequently, two different mapping files may be required: one for the
       HP-supplied TFM files, and one for more recent TFM files.
