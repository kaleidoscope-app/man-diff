PROTOCOLS(5)                   File Formats Manual                  PROTOCOLS(5)

NAME
     protocols â€“ protocol name data base

DESCRIPTION
     The protocols file contains information regarding the known protocols used
     in the DARPA Internet.  For each protocol a single line should be present
     with the following information:

           official protocol name
           protocol number
           aliases

     Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters.  A ``#''
     indicates the beginning of a comment; characters up to the end of the line
     are not interpreted by routines which search the file.

     Protocol names may contain any printable character other than a field
     delimiter, newline, or comment character.

INTERACTION WITH DIRECTORY SERVICES
     Processes generally find protocol records using one of the getprotoent(3)
     family of functions.  On Mac OS X, these functions interact with the
     DirectoryService(8) daemon, which reads the /etc/protocols file as well as
     searching other directory information services to determine protocol name
     and number information.

FILES
     /etc/protocols

SEE ALSO
     getprotoent(3), DirectoryService(8)

HISTORY
     The protocols file format appeared in 4.2BSD.
