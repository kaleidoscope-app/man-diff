NAME
       slapo-constraint - Attribute Constraint Overlay to slapd

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The constraint overlay is used to ensure that attribute values match some
       constraints beyond basic LDAP syntax.  Attributes can have multiple
       constraints placed upon them, and all must be satisfied when modifying an
       attribute value under constraint.

       This overlay is intended to be used to force syntactic regularity upon
       certain string represented data which have well known canonical forms,
       like telephone numbers, post codes, FQDNs, etc.

       It constrains only LDAP add, modify and rename commands and only seeks to
       control the add and replace values of modify and rename requests.

       No constraints are applied for operations performed with the relax
       control set.

CONFIGURATION
       This slapd.conf option applies to the constraint overlay.  It should
       appear after the overlay directive.

       constraint_attribute <attribute_name>[,...] <type> <value> [<extra>
       [...]] Specifies the constraint which should apply to the comma-separated
              attribute list named as the first parameter.  Five types of
              constraint are currently supported - regex, size, count, uri, and
              set.

              The parameter following the regex type is a Unix style regular
              expression (See regex(7) ). The parameter following the uri type
              is an LDAP URI. The URI will be evaluated using an internal
              search.  It must not include a hostname, and it must include a
              list of attributes to evaluate.

              The parameter following the set type is a string that is
              interpreted according to the syntax in use for ACL sets.  This
              allows to construct constraints based on the contents of the
              entry.

              The size type can be used to enforce a limit on an attribute
              length, and the count type limits the number of values of an
              attribute.

              Extra parameters can occur in any order after those described
              above.

              <extra> : restrict=<uri>

              This extra parameter allows to restrict the application of the
              corresponding constraint only to entries that match the base,
              scope and filter portions of the LDAP URI.  The base, if present,
              must be within the naming context of the database.  The scope is
              only used when the base is present; it defaults to base.  The
              other parameters of the URI are not allowed.


       Any attempt to add or modify an attribute named as part of the constraint
       overlay specification which does not fit the constraint listed will fail
       with a LDAP_CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION error.

EXAMPLES
              overlay constraint
              constraint_attribute jpegPhoto size 131072
              constraint_attribute userPassword count 3
              constraint_attribute mail regex ^[[:alnum:]]+@mydomain.com$
              constraint_attribute title uri
                ldap:///dc=catalog,dc=example,dc=com?title?sub?(objectClass=titleCatalog)
              constraint_attribute cn,sn,givenName set
                "(this/givenName + [ ] + this/sn) & this/cn"
                restrict="ldap:///ou=People,dc=example,dc=com??sub?(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)"

       A specification like the above would reject any mail attribute which did
       not look like <alpha-numeric string>@mydomain.com.  It would also reject
       any title attribute whose values were not listed in the title attribute
       of any titleCatalog entries in the given scope. (Note that the
       "dc=catalog,dc=example,dc=com" subtree ought to reside in a separate
       database, otherwise the initial set of titleCatalog entries could not be
       populated while the constraint is in effect.)  Finally, it requires the
       values of the attribute cn to be constructed by pairing values of the
       attributes sn and givenName, separated by a space, but only for entries
       derived from the objectClass inetOrgPerson.
