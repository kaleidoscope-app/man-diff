NAME
       cupsd.conf - server configuration file for cups

DESCRIPTION
       The cupsd.conf file configures the CUPS scheduler, cupsd(8).  It is
       normally located in the /etc/cups directory.  Each line in the file can
       be a configuration directive, a blank line, or a comment.  Configuration
       directives typically consist of a name and zero or more values separated
       by whitespace.  The configuration directive name and values are case-
       insensitive.  Comment lines start with the # character.

   TOP-LEVEL DIRECTIVES
       The following top-level directives are understood by cupsd(8):

       AccessLogLevel config

       AccessLogLevel actions

       AccessLogLevel all
            Specifies the logging level for the AccessLog file.  The "config"
            level logs when printers and classes are added, deleted, or modified
            and when configuration files are accessed or updated.  The "actions"
            level logs when print jobs are submitted, held, released, modified,
            or canceled, and any of the conditions for "config".  The "all"
            level logs all requests.  The default access log level is "actions".

       AutoPurgeJobs Yes

       AutoPurgeJobs No
            Specifies whether to purge job history data automatically when it is
            no longer required for quotas.  The default is "No".

       BrowseDNSSDSubTypes_subtype[,...]
            Specifies a list of Bonjour sub-types to advertise for each shared
            printer.  For example, "BrowseDNSSDSubTypes _cups,_print" will tell
            network clients that both CUPS sharing and IPP Everywhere are
            supported.  The default is "_cups" which is necessary for printer
            sharing to work between systems using CUPS.

       BrowseLocalProtocols all

       BrowseLocalProtocols dnssd

       BrowseLocalProtocols none
            Specifies which protocols to use for local printer sharing.  The
            default is "dnssd" on systems that support Bonjour and "none"
            otherwise.

       BrowseWebIF Yes

       BrowseWebIF No
            Specifies whether the CUPS web interface is advertised.  The default
            is "No".

       Browsing Yes

       Browsing No
            Specifies whether shared printers are advertised.  The default is
            "No".

       DefaultAuthType Basic

       DefaultAuthType Negotiate
            Specifies the default type of authentication to use.  The default is
            "Basic".

       DefaultEncryption Never

       DefaultEncryption IfRequested

       DefaultEncryption Required
            Specifies whether encryption will be used for authenticated
            requests.  The default is "Required".

       DefaultLanguage locale
            Specifies the default language to use for text and web content.  The
            default is "en".

       DefaultPaperSize Auto

       DefaultPaperSize None

       DefaultPaperSize sizename
            Specifies the default paper size for new print queues. "Auto" uses a
            locale-specific default, while "None" specifies there is no default
            paper size.  Specific size names are typically "Letter" or "A4".
            The default is "Auto".

       DefaultPolicy policy-name
            Specifies the default access policy to use.  The default access
            policy is "default".

       DefaultShared Yes

       DefaultShared No
            Specifies whether local printers are shared by default.  The default
            is "Yes".

       DirtyCleanInterval seconds
            Specifies the delay for updating of configuration and state files.
            A value of 0 causes the update to happen as soon as possible,
            typically within a few milliseconds.  The default value is "30".

       DNSSDHostNamehostname.example.com
            Specifies the fully-qualified domain name for the server that is
            used for Bonjour sharing.  The default is typically the server's
            ".local" hostname.

       ErrorPolicy abort-job
            Specifies that a failed print job should be aborted (discarded)
            unless otherwise specified for the printer.

       ErrorPolicy retry-current-job
            Specifies that a failed print job should be retried immediately
            unless otherwise specified for the printer.

       ErrorPolicy retry-job
            Specifies that a failed print job should be retried at a later time
            unless otherwise specified for the printer.

       ErrorPolicy stop-printer
            Specifies that a failed print job should stop the printer unless
            otherwise specified for the printer. The 'stop-printer' error policy
            is the default.

       FilterLimit limit
            Specifies the maximum cost of filters that are run concurrently,
            which can be used to minimize disk, memory, and CPU resource
            problems.  A limit of 0 disables filter limiting.  An average print
            to a non-PostScript printer needs a filter limit of about 200.  A
            PostScript printer needs about half that (100).  Setting the limit
            below these thresholds will effectively limit the scheduler to
            printing a single job at any time.  The default limit is "0".

       FilterNice nice-value
            Specifies the scheduling priority ( nice(8) value) of filters that
            are run to print a job.  The nice value ranges from 0, the highest
            priority, to 19, the lowest priority.  The default is 0.

       GSSServiceName name
            Specifies the service name when using Kerberos authentication.  The
            default service name is "http."

       HostNameLookups On

       HostNameLookups Off

       HostNameLookups Double
            Specifies whether to do reverse lookups on connecting clients.  The
            "Double" setting causes cupsd(8) to verify that the hostname
            resolved from the address matches one of the addresses returned for
            that hostname.  Double lookups also prevent clients with
            unregistered addresses from connecting to your server.  The default
            is "Off" to avoid the potential server performance problems with
            hostname lookups.  Only set this option to "On" or "Double" if
            absolutely required.

       IdleExitTimeout seconds
            Specifies the length of time to wait before shutting down due to
            inactivity.  The default is "60" seconds.  Note: Only applicable
            when cupsd(8) is run on-demand (e.g., with -l).

       JobKillDelay seconds
            Specifies the number of seconds to wait before killing the filters
            and backend associated with a canceled or held job.  The default is
            "30".

       JobRetryInterval seconds
            Specifies the interval between retries of jobs in seconds.  This is
            typically used for fax queues but can also be used with normal print
            queues whose error policy is "retry-job" or "retry-current-job".
            The default is "30".

       JobRetryLimit count
            Specifies the number of retries that are done for jobs.  This is
            typically used for fax queues but can also be used with normal print
            queues whose error policy is "retry-job" or "retry-current-job".
            The default is "5".

       KeepAlive Yes

       KeepAlive No
            Specifies whether to support HTTP keep-alive connections.  The
            default is "Yes".

       KeepAliveTimeout seconds
            Specifies how long an idle client connection remains open.  The
            default is "30".

       <Limit operation ...> ... </Limit>
            Specifies the IPP operations that are being limited inside a Policy
            section. IPP operation names are listed below in the section "IPP
            OPERATION NAMES".

       <Limit method ...> ... </Limit>

       <LimitExcept method ...> ... </LimitExcept>
            Specifies the HTTP methods that are being limited inside a Location
            section. HTTP method names are listed below in the section "HTTP
            METHOD NAMES".

       LimitRequestBody size
            Specifies the maximum size of print files, IPP requests, and HTML
            form data.  The default is "0" which disables the limit check.

       Listen ipv4-address:port

       Listen [ipv6-address]:port

       Listen *:port

       Listen /path/to/domain/socket
            Listens to the specified address and port or domain socket path for
            connections.  Multiple Listen directives can be provided to listen
            on multiple addresses.  The Listen directive is similar to the Port
            directive but allows you to restrict access to specific interfaces
            or networks.

       ListenBackLog number
            Specifies the number of pending connections that will be allowed.
            This normally only affects very busy servers that have reached the
            MaxClients limit, but can also be triggered by large numbers of
            simultaneous connections.  When the limit is reached, the operating
            system will refuse additional connections until the scheduler can
            accept the pending ones.  The default is the OS-defined default
            limit, typically either "5" for older operating systems or "128" for
            newer operating systems.

       <Location /path> ... </Location>
            Specifies access control for the named location.  Paths are
            documented below in the section "LOCATION PATHS".

       LogDebugHistory number
            Specifies the number of debugging messages that are retained for
            logging if an error occurs in a print job. Debug messages are logged
            regardless of the LogLevel setting.

       LogLevel none

       LogLevel emerg

       LogLevel alert

       LogLevel crit

       LogLevel error

       LogLevel warn

       LogLevel notice

       LogLevel info

       LogLevel debug

       LogLevel debug2
            Specifies the level of logging for the ErrorLog file.  The value
            "none" stops all logging while "debug2" logs everything.  The
            default is "warn".

       LogTimeFormat standard

       LogTimeFormat usecs
            Specifies the format of the date and time in the log files.  The
            value "standard" is the default and logs whole seconds while "usecs"
            logs microseconds.

       MaxClients number
            Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous clients that are
            allowed by the scheduler.  The default is "100".

       MaxClientsPerHost number
            Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous clients that are
            allowed from a single address.  The default is the MaxClients value.

       MaxCopies number
            Specifies the maximum number of copies that a user can print of each
            job.  The default is "9999".

       MaxHoldTime seconds
            Specifies the maximum time a job may remain in the "indefinite" hold
            state before it is canceled.  The default is "0" which disables
            cancellation of held jobs.

       MaxJobs number
            Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous jobs that are allowed.
            Set to "0" to allow an unlimited number of jobs.  The default is
            "500".

       MaxJobsPerPrinter number
            Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous jobs that are allowed
            per printer.  The default is "0" which allows up to MaxJobs jobs per
            printer.

       MaxJobsPerUser number
            Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous jobs that are allowed
            per user.  The default is "0" which allows up to MaxJobs jobs per
            user.

       MaxJobTime seconds
            Specifies the maximum time a job may take to print before it is
            canceled.  Set to "0" to disable cancellation of "stuck" jobs.  The
            default is "10800" (3 hours).

       MaxLogSize size
            Specifies the maximum size of the log files before they are rotated.
            The value "0" disables log rotation.  The default is "1048576"
            (1MB).

       MultipleOperationTimeout seconds
            Specifies the maximum amount of time to allow between files in a
            multiple file print job.  The default is "900" (15 minutes).

       <Policy name> ... </Policy>
            Specifies access control for the named policy.

       Port number
            Listens to the specified port number for connections.

       PreserveJobFiles Yes

       PreserveJobFiles No

       PreserveJobFiles seconds
            Specifies whether job files (documents) are preserved after a job is
            printed.  If a numeric value is specified, job files are preserved
            for the indicated number of seconds after printing.  The default is
            "86400" (preserve 1 day).

       PreserveJobHistory Yes

       PreserveJobHistory No

       PreserveJobHistory seconds
            Specifies whether the job history is preserved after a job is
            printed.  If a numeric value is specified, the job history is
            preserved for the indicated number of seconds after printing.  If
            "Yes", the job history is preserved until the MaxJobs limit is
            reached.  The default is "Yes".

       ReloadTimeout seconds
            Specifies the amount of time to wait for job completion before
            restarting the scheduler.  The default is "30".

       ServerAdmin email-address
            Specifies the email address of the server administrator.  The
            default value is "root@ServerName".

       ServerAlias hostname [ ... hostname ]

       ServerAlias *
            The ServerAlias directive is used for HTTP Host header validation
            when clients connect to the scheduler from external interfaces.
            Using the special name "*" can expose your system to known browser-
            based DNS rebinding attacks, even when accessing sites through a
            firewall.  If the auto-discovery of alternate names does not work,
            we recommend listing each alternate name with a ServerAlias
            directive instead of using "*".

       ServerName hostname
            Specifies the fully-qualified hostname of the server.  The default
            is the value reported by the hostname(1) command.

       ServerTokens None

       ServerTokens ProductOnly

       ServerTokens Major

       ServerTokens Minor

       ServerTokens Minimal

       ServerTokens OS

       ServerTokens Full
            Specifies what information is included in the Server header of HTTP
            responses.  "None" disables the Server header.  "ProductOnly"
            reports "CUPS".  "Major" reports "CUPS/major IPP/2".  "Minor"
            reports "CUPS/major.minor IPP/2.1".  "Minimal" reports
            "CUPS/major.minor.patch IPP/2.1".  "OS" reports
            "CUPS/major.minor.path (osname osversion) IPP/2.1".  "Full" reports
            "CUPS/major.minor.path (osname osversion; architecture) IPP/2.1".
            The default is "Minimal".

       SSLListen ipv4-address:port

       SSLListen [ipv6-address]:port

       SSLListen *:port
            Listens on the specified address and port for encrypted connections.

       SSLOptions [AllowDH] [AllowRC4] [AllowSSL3] [DenyCBC] [DenyTLS1.0]
       [MaxTLS1.0] [MaxTLS1.1] [MaxTLS1.2] [MaxTLS1.3] [MinTLS1.0] [MinTLS1.1]
       [MinTLS1.2] [MinTLS1.3]

       SSLOptions None
            Sets encryption options (only in /etc/cups/client.conf).  By
            default, CUPS only supports encryption using TLS v1.0 or higher
            using known secure cipher suites.  Security is reduced when Allow
            options are used.  Security is enhanced when Deny options are used.
            The AllowDH option enables cipher suites using plain Diffie-Hellman
            key negotiation (not supported on systems using GNU TLS).  The
            AllowRC4 option enables the 128-bit RC4 cipher suites, which are
            required for some older clients.  The AllowSSL3 option enables SSL
            v3.0, which is required for some older clients that do not support
            TLS v1.0.  The DenyCBC option disables all CBC cipher suites.  The
            DenyTLS1.0 option disables TLS v1.0 support - this sets the minimum
            protocol version to TLS v1.1.  The MinTLS options set the minimum
            TLS version to support.  The MaxTLS options set the maximum TLS
            version to support.  Not all operating systems support TLS 1.3 at
            this time.

       SSLPort port
            Listens on the specified port for encrypted connections.

       StrictConformance Yes

       StrictConformance No
            Specifies whether the scheduler requires clients to strictly adhere
            to the IPP specifications.  The default is "No".

       Timeout seconds
            Specifies the HTTP request timeout.  The default is "900" (15
            minutes).

       WebInterface yes

       WebInterface no
            Specifies whether the web interface is enabled.  The default is
            "No".

   HTTP METHOD NAMES
       The following HTTP methods are supported by cupsd(8):

       GET  Used by a client to download icons and other printer resources and
            to access the CUPS web interface.

   DIRECTIVES VALID WITHIN LOCATION AND LIMIT SECTIONS
       The following directives may be placed inside Location and Limit sections
       in the cupsd.conf file:

       Allow all

       Allow none

       Allow host.domain.com

       Allow *.domain.com

       Allow ipv4-address

       Allow ipv4-address/netmask

       Allow ipv4-address/mm

       Allow [ipv6-address]

       Allow [ipv6-address]/mm

       Allow @IF(name)

       Allow @LOCAL
            Allows access from the named hosts, domains, addresses, or
            interfaces.  The @IF(name) form uses the current subnets configured
            for the named interface.  The @LOCAL form uses the current subnets
            configured for all interfaces that are not point-to-point, for
            example Ethernet and Wi-Fi interfaces are used but DSL and VPN
            interfaces are not.  The Order directive controls whether Allow
            lines are evaluated before or after Deny lines.

       AuthType None

       AuthType Basic

       AuthType Default

       AuthType Negotiate
            Specifies the type of authentication required.  The value "Default"
            corresponds to the DefaultAuthType value.

       Deny all

       Deny none

       Deny host.domain.com

       Deny *.domain.com

       Deny ipv4-address

       Deny ipv4-address/netmask

       Deny ipv4-address/mm

       Deny [ipv6-address]

       Deny [ipv6-address]/mm

       Deny @IF(name)

       Deny @LOCAL
            Denies access from the named hosts, domains, addresses, or
            interfaces.  The @IF(name) form uses the current subnets configured
            for the named interface.  The @LOCAL form uses the current subnets
            configured for all interfaces that are not point-to-point, for
            example Ethernet and Wi-Fi interfaces are used but DSL and VPN
            interfaces are not.  The Order directive controls whether Deny lines
            are evaluated before or after Allow lines.

       Encryption IfRequested

       Encryption Never

       Encryption Required
            Specifies the level of encryption that is required for a particular
            location.  The default value is "IfRequested".

       Order allow,deny
            Specifies that access is denied by default. Allow lines are then
            processed followed by Deny lines to determine whether a client may
            access a particular resource.

       Order deny,allow
            Specifies that access is allowed by default. Deny lines are then
            processed followed by Allow lines to determine whether a client may
            access a particular resource.

       Require group group-name [ group-name ... ]
            Specifies that an authenticated user must be a member of one of the
            named groups.

       Require user {user-name|@group-name} ...
            Specifies that an authenticated user must match one of the named
            users or be a member of one of the named groups.  The group name
            "@SYSTEM" corresponds to the list of groups defined by the
            SystemGroup directive in the cups-files.conf(5) file.  The group
            name "@OWNER" corresponds to the owner of the resource, for example
            the person that submitted a print job.  Note: The 'root' user is not
            special and must be granted privileges like any other user account.

       Require valid-user
            Specifies that any authenticated user is acceptable.

       Satisfy all
            Specifies that all Allow, AuthType, Deny, Order, and Require
            conditions must be satisfied to allow access.

       Satisfy any
            Specifies that any a client may access a resource if either the
            authentication (AuthType/Require) or address (Allow/Deny/Order)
            conditions are satisfied.  For example, this can be used to require
            authentication only for remote accesses.

   DIRECTIVES VALID WITHIN POLICY SECTIONS
       The following directives may be placed inside Policy sections in the
       cupsd.conf file:

       JobPrivateAccess all

       JobPrivateAccess default

       JobPrivateAccess {user|@group|@ACL|@OWNER|@SYSTEM} ...
            Specifies an access list for a job's private values.  The "default"
            access list is "@OWNER @SYSTEM".  "@ACL" maps to the printer's
            requesting-user-name-allowed or requesting-user-name-denied values.
            "@OWNER" maps to the job's owner.  "@SYSTEM" maps to the groups
            listed for the SystemGroup directive in the cups-files.conf(5) file.

       JobPrivateValues all

       JobPrivateValues default

       JobPrivateValues none

       JobPrivateValues attribute-name [ ... attribute-name ]
            Specifies the list of job values to make private.  The "default"
            values are "job-name", "job-originating-host-name", "job-
            originating-user-name", and "phone".

       SubscriptionPrivateAccess all

       SubscriptionPrivateAccess default

       SubscriptionPrivateAccess {user|@group|@ACL|@OWNER|@SYSTEM} ...
            Specifies an access list for a subscription's private values.  The
            "default" access list is "@OWNER @SYSTEM".  "@ACL" maps to the
            printer's requesting-user-name-allowed or requesting-user-name-
            denied values.  "@OWNER" maps to the job's owner.  "@SYSTEM" maps to
            the groups listed for the SystemGroup directive in the
            cups-files.conf(5) file.

       SubscriptionPrivateValues all

       SubscriptionPrivateValues default

       SubscriptionPrivateValues none

       SubscriptionPrivateValues attribute-name [ ... attribute-name ]
            Specifies the list of subscription values to make private.  The
            "default" values are "notify-events", "notify-pull-method", "notify-
            recipient-uri", "notify-subscriber-user-name", and "notify-user-
            data".

   DEPRECATED DIRECTIVES
       The following directives are deprecated and will be removed in a future
       release of CUPS:

       Classification banner
            Specifies the security classification of the server.  Any valid
            banner name can be used, including "classified", "confidential",
            "secret", "topsecret", and "unclassified", or the banner can be
            omitted to disable secure printing functions.  The default is no
            classification banner.

       ClassifyOverride Yes

       ClassifyOverride No
            Specifies whether users may override the classification (cover page)
            of individual print jobs using the "job-sheets" option.  The default
            is "No".

       PageLogFormat format-string
            Specifies the format of PageLog lines.  Sequences beginning with
            percent (%) characters are replaced with the corresponding
            information, while all other characters are copied literally.  The
            following percent sequences are recognized:

                "%%" inserts a single percent character.
                "%{name}" inserts the value of the specified IPP attribute.
                "%C" inserts the number of copies for the current page.
                "%P" inserts the current page number.
                "%T" inserts the current date and time in common log format.
                "%j" inserts the job ID.
                "%p" inserts the printer name.
                "%u" inserts the username.

            The default is the empty string, which disables page logging.  The
            string "%p %u %j %T %P %C %{job-billing} %{job-originating-host-
            name} %{job-name} %{media} %{sides}" creates a page log with the
            standard items.  Use "%{job-impressions-completed}" to insert the
            number of pages (sides) that were printed, or "%{job-media-sheets-
            completed}" to insert the number of sheets that were printed.

       RIPCache size
            Specifies the maximum amount of memory to use when converting
            documents into bitmaps for a printer.  The default is "128m".

NOTES
       File, directory, and user configuration directives that used to be
       allowed in the cupsd.conf file are now stored in the cups-files.conf(5)
       file instead in order to prevent certain types of privilege escalation
       attacks.

       The scheduler MUST be restarted manually after making changes to the
       cupsd.conf file.  On Linux this is typically done using the systemctl(8)
       command, while on macOS the launchctl(8) command is used instead.

       The @LOCAL macro name can be confusing since the system running cupsd
       often belongs to a different set of subnets from its clients.

CONFORMING TO
       The cupsd.conf file format is based on the Apache HTTP Server
       configuration file format.

EXAMPLES
       Log everything with a maximum log file size of 32 megabytes:

           AccessLogLevel all
           LogLevel debug2
           MaxLogSize 32m

       Require authentication for accesses from outside the 10. network:

           <Location />
           Order allow,deny
           Allow from 10./8
           AuthType Basic
           Require valid-user
           Satisfy any
           </Location>
