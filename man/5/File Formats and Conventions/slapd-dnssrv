NAME
       slapd-dnssrv - DNS SRV referral backend to slapd

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The DNSSRV backend to slapd(8) serves up referrals based upon SRV
       resource records held in the Domain Name System.

       This backend is experimental.

CONFIGURATION
       The DNSSRV backend has no backend nor database specific options.  It is
       configured simply by "database dnssrv" followed a suffix directive, e.g.
       suffix "".

ACCESS CONTROL
       The dnssrv backend does not honor all ACL semantics as described in
       slapd.access(5).  In fact, this backend only implements the search
       operation when the manageDSAit control (RFC 3296) is used, otherwise for
       every operation a referral, whenever appropriate, or an error is
       returned.  Currently, there is no means to condition the returning of the
       referral by means of ACLs; no access control is implemented, except for
       read (=r) access to the returned entries, which is actually provided by
       the frontend.  Note, however, that the information returned by this
       backend is collected through the DNS, so it is public by definition.
