SLAPD-NULL(5)                  File Formats Manual                 SLAPD-NULL(5)



NAME
       slapd-null - Null backend to slapd

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The Null backend to slapd(8) is surely the most useful part of slapd:
       - Searches return success but no entries.
       - Compares return compareFalse.
       - Updates return success (unless readonly is on) but do nothing.
       - Binds other than as the rootdn fail unless the database option "bind
       on" is given.
       - The slapadd(8) and slapcat(8) tools are equally exciting.
       Inspired by the /dev/null device.

CONFIGURATION
       This slapd.conf option applies to the NULL backend database.  That is, it
       must follow a "database null" line and come before any subsequent
       "database" lines.  Other database options are described in the
       slapd.conf(5) manual page.

       bind <on/off>
              Allow binds as any DN in this backend's suffix, with any password.
              The default is "off".

EXAMPLE
       Here is a possible slapd.conf extract using the Null backend:

              database null
              suffix   "cn=Nothing"
              bind     on

ACCESS CONTROL
       The null backend does not honor any of the access control semantics
       described in slapd.access(5).
