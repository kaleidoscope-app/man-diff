INFO(5)                        File Formats Manual                       INFO(5)



NAME
       info - readable online documentation

DESCRIPTION
       The Info file format is an easily-parsable representation for online
       documents.  It can be read by emacs(1) and info(1) among other programs.

       Info files are usually created from texinfo(5) sources by makeinfo(1),
       but can be created from scratch if so desired.

       For a full description of the Texinfo language and associated tools,
       please see the Texinfo manual (written in Texinfo itself).  Most likely,
       running this command from your shell:
              info texinfo
       or this key sequence from inside Emacs:
              M-x info RET m texinfo RET
       will get you there.

AVAILABILITY
       ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/texinfo-<version>.tar.gz
       or any GNU mirror site.

REPORTING BUGS
       Please send bug reports to bug-texinfo@gnu.org, general questions and
       discussion to help-texinfo@gnu.org.
