SLAPD-LDIF(5)                  File Formats Manual                 SLAPD-LDIF(5)



NAME
       slapd-ldif - LDIF backend to slapd

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The LDIF backend to slapd(8) is a basic storage backend that stores
       entries in text files in LDIF format, and exploits the filesystem to
       create the tree structure of the database.  It is intended as a cheap,
       low performance easy to use backend, and it is exploited by higher-level
       internal structures to provide a permanent storage.

CONFIGURATION
       These slapd.conf options apply to the LDIF backend database.  That is,
       they must follow a "database ldif" line and come before any subsequent
       "backend" or "database" lines.  Other database options are described in
       the slapd.conf(5) manual page.

       directory <dir>
              Specify the directory where the database tree starts.  The
              directory must exist and grant appropriate permissions (rwx) to
              the identity slapd is running with.

ACCESS CONTROL
       The LDIF backend does not honor any of the access control semantics
       described in slapd.access(5).  Only read (=r) access to the entry pseudo-
       attribute and to the other attribute values of the entries returned by
       the search operation is honored, which is performed by the frontend.

FILES
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf
              default slapd configuration file
