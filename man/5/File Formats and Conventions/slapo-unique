SLAPO-UNIQUE(5)                File Formats Manual               SLAPO-UNIQUE(5)



NAME
       slapo-unique - Attribute Uniqueness overlay to slapd

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The Attribute Uniqueness overlay can be used with a backend database such
       as slapd-bdb(5) to enforce the uniqueness of some or all attributes
       within a scope. This subtree defaults to all objects within the subtree
       of the database for which the Uniqueness overlay is configured.

       Uniqueness is enforced by searching the subtree to ensure that the values
       of all attributes presented with an add, modify or modrdn operation are
       unique within the scope.  For example, if uniqueness were enforced for
       the uid attribute, the subtree would be searched for any other records
       which also have a uid attribute containing the same value. If any are
       found, the request is rejected.

       The search is performed using the rootdn of the database, to avoid issues
       with ACLs preventing the overlay from seeing all of the relevant data. As
       such, the database must have a rootdn configured.

CONFIGURATION
       These slapd.conf options apply to the Attribute Uniqueness overlay.  They
       should appear after the overlay directive.

       unique_uri <[strict ][ignore ]URI[URI...]...>
              Configure the base, attributes, scope, and filter for uniqueness
              checking.  Multiple URIs may be specified within a domain,
              allowing complex selections of objects.  Multiple unique_uri
              statements or olcUniqueURI attributes will create independent
              domains, each with their own independent lists of URIs and
              ignore/strict settings.

              Keywords strict and ignore have to be enclosed in quotes (")
              together with the URI.

              The LDAP URI syntax is a subset of RFC-4516, and takes the form:

              ldap:///[base dn]?[attributes...]?scope[?filter]

              The base dn defaults to that of the back-end database.  Specified
              base dns must be within the subtree of the back-end database.

              If no attributes are specified, the URI applies to all non-
              operational attributes.

              The scope component is effectively mandatory, because LDAP URIs
              default to base scope, which is not valid for uniqueness, because
              groups of one object are always unique.  Scopes of sub (for
              subtree) and one for one-level are valid.

              The filter component causes the domain to apply uniqueness
              constraints only to matching objects.  e.g.
              ldap:///?cn?sub?(sn=e*) would require unique cn attributes for all
              objects in the subtree of the back-end database whose sn starts
              with an e.

              It is possible to assert uniqueness upon all non-operational
              attributes except those listed by prepending the keyword ignore If
              not configured, all non-operational (e.g., system) attributes must
              be unique. Note that the attributes list of an ignore URI should
              generally contain the objectClass, dc, ou and o attributes, as
              these will generally not be unique, nor are they operational
              attributes.

              It is possible to set strict checking for the uniqueness domain by
              prepending the keyword strict.  By default, uniqueness is not
              enforced for null values. Enabling strict mode extends the concept
              of uniqueness to include null values, such that only one attribute
              within a subtree will be allowed to have a null value.  Strictness
              applies to all URIs within a uniqueness domain, but some domains
              may be strict while others are not.

       It is not possible to set both URIs and legacy slapo-unique configuration
       parameters simultaneously. In general, the legacy configuration options
       control pieces of a single unfiltered subtree domain.

       unique_base <basedn>
              This legacy configuration parameter should be converted to the
              base dn component of the above unique_uri style of parameter.

       unique_ignore <attribute...>
              This legacy configuration parameter should be converted to a
              unique_uri parameter with ignore keyword as described above.

       unique_attributes <attribute...>
              This legacy configuration parameter should be converted to a
              unique_uri parameter, as described above.

       unique_strict <attribute...>
              This legacy configuration parameter should be converted to a
              strict keyword prepended to a unique_uri parameter, as described
              above.

CAVEATS
       unique_uri cannot be used with the old-style of configuration, and vice
       versa.  unique_uri can implement everything the older system can do,
       however.

       Typical attributes for the ignore ldap:///...  URIs are intentionally not
       hardcoded into the overlay to allow for maximum flexibility in meeting
       site-specific requirements.

       Replication and operations with manageDsaIt control are allowed to bypass
       this enforcement. It is therefore important that all servers accepting
       writes have this overlay configured in order to maintain uniqueness in a
       replicated DIT.
