SYNOPSIS
       htdigest [ -c ] passwdfile realm username



SUMMARY
       htdigest is used to create and update the flat-files used to store
       usernames, realm and password for digest authentication of HTTP users.
       Resources available from the Apache HTTP server can be restricted to just
       the users listed in the files created by htdigest.


       This manual page only lists the command line arguments. For details of
       the directives necessary to configure digest authentication in httpd see
       the Apache manual, which is part of the Apache distribution or can be
       found at http://httpd.apache.org/.
