OSACOMPILE(1)                General Commands Manual               OSACOMPILE(1)

NAME
     osacompile – compile AppleScripts and other OSA language scripts

SYNOPSIS
     osacompile [-l language] [-e command] [-o name] [-d] [-r type:id] [-t type]
                [-c creator] [-x] [-s] [-u] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     osacompile compiles the given files, or standard input if none are listed,
     into a single output script.  Files may be plain text or other compiled
     scripts.  The options are as follows:

     -l language
           Override the language for any plain text files.  Normally, plain text
           files are compiled as AppleScript.

     -e command
           Enter one line of a script.  Script commands given via -e are
           prepended to the normal source, if any.  Multiple -e options may be
           given to build up a multi-line script.  Because most scripts use
           characters that are special to many shell programs (e.g., AppleScript
           uses single and double quote marks, “(”, “)”, and “*”), the command
           will have to be correctly quoted and escaped to get it past the shell
           intact.

     -o name
           Place the output in the file name.  If -o is not specified, the
           resulting script is placed in the file “a.scpt”.  The value of -o
           partly determines the output file format; see below.

     -x    Save the resulting script as execute-only.

     The following options are only relevant when creating a new bundled applet
     or droplet:

     -s    Stay-open applet.

     -u    Use startup screen.

     The following options control the packaging of the output file.  You should
     only need them for compatibility with classic Mac OS or for custom file
     formats.

     -d    Place the resulting script in the data fork of the output file.  This
           is the default.

     -r type:id
           Place the resulting script in the resource fork of the output file,
           in the specified resource.

     -t type
           Set the output file type to type, where type is a four-character
           code.  If this option is not specified, the creator code will not be
           set.

     -c creator
           Set the output file creator to creator, where creator is a four-
           character code.  If this option is not specified, the creator code
           will not be set.

     If no options are specified, osacompile produces a Mac OS X format script
     file: data fork only, with no type or creator code.

     If the -o option is specified and the file does not already exist,
     osacompile uses the filename extension to determine what type of file to
     create.  If the filename ends with “.app”, it creates a bundled applet or
     droplet.  If the filename ends with “.scptd”, it creates a bundled compiled
     script.  Otherwise, it creates a flat file with the script data placed
     according to the values of the -d and -r options.

EXAMPLES
     To produce a script compatible with classic Mac OS:

           osacompile -r scpt:128 -t osas -c ToyS example.applescript
