SNTP(1)                      General Commands Manual                     SNTP(1)

NAME
     sntp â€“ A very Simple Network Time Protocol client program

SYNOPSIS
     sntp [-drSs] [-g milliseconds] [-t seconds] host-name-or-IP

DESCRIPTION
     -d       Enable debug logging.

     -g milliseconds
              Gap betwen requests in milliseconds.

     -n number
              Number of DNS records to use for each host argument. This does not
              have to be less than, equal to, or greater than the number of
              records that any host lookup returns. Numbers smaller than the
              number of records will fetch only that many records. Numbers
              larger than the number of records will fetch some records more
              than once, as required, to reach the number of fetches desired.

     -r       bind(2) the NTP reserved port (123) for source communications.

     -S       Use clock_settime(2) to set the system clock if the offset is
              greater than 50 milliseconds, or -s is not specified.

     -s       Use adjtime(2) to slew the system clock if the offset is less than
              50 milliseconds.

     -t seconds
              Maximum number of seconds to wait for responses.

     -z path  Path to dump header state to. This is useful for sntpd(8) to read
              from. Header data is stored on disk in big-endian (NBO) format.

USAGE
     sntp pool.ntp.org

SEE ALSO
     clock_settime(2), adjtime(2), timed(8), sntpd(8)

HISTORY
     This sntp should not be confused with the Network Time Foundation's sntp
     implementation. This is a simplified client that supports a minimal subset
     of features for compatibility.

     This sntp first appeared in macOS 11.0.
