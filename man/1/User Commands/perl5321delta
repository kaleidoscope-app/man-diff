   Changes to Existing Documentation
       We have attempted to update the documentation to reflect the changes
       listed in this document.  If you find any we have missed, open an issue
       at <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.

       perlop

       •   Document range op behaviour change.

Diagnostics
       The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic output,
       including warnings and fatal error messages.  For the complete list of
       diagnostic messages, see perldiag.

   Changes to Existing Diagnostics
       •   \K not permitted in lookahead/lookbehind in regex; marked by <-- HERE
           in m/%s/

           This error was incorrectly produced in some cases involving nested
           lookarounds.  This has been fixed.

           [GH #18123 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18123>]

Configuration and Compilation
       •   Newer 64-bit versions of the Intel C/C++ compiler are now recognized
           and have the correct flags set.

       •   We now trap SIGBUS when Configure checks for "va_copy".

           On several systems the attempt to determine if we need "va_copy" or
           similar results in a SIGBUS instead of the expected SIGSEGV, which
           previously caused a core dump.

           [GH #18148 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18148>]

Testing
       Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and changes
       in this release.

Platform Support
   Platform-Specific Notes
       MacOS (Darwin)
           The hints file for darwin has been updated to handle future macOS
           versions beyond 10.  Perl can now be built on macOS Big Sur.

           [GH #18341 <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18341>]

       community of users and developers.  The following people are known to
       have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.32.1:

       Adam Hartley, Andy Dougherty, Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsaaker, Dan Book, David

       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
       generated from version control history.  In particular, it does not
       include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
       modules included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN
       community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please
       see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.

Reporting Bugs
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug
       database at <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  There may also be
       information at <http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at
       <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  Be sure to trim your bug down to
       a tiny but sufficient test case.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
       inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see "SECURITY
       VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec for details of how to
       report the issue.

Give Thanks
       If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl
       5, you can do so by running the "perlthanks" program:

           perlthanks

       This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of
       thanks.
