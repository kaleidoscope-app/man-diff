     who – display who is logged in

SYNOPSIS
     who [-abdHlmpqrsTtu] [file]

DESCRIPTION
     The who utility displays a list of all users currently logged on, showing
     for each user the login name, tty name, the date and time of login, and
     hostname if not local.

     Available options:

     -a    Same as -bdlprTtu.

     -b    Time of last system boot.

     -d    Print dead processes.

     -H    Write column headings above the regular output.

     -l    Print system login processes (unsupported).

     -m    Only print information about the current terminal.  This is the POSIX

     -q    “Quick mode”: List only the names and the number of users currently
           logged on.  When this option is used, all other options are ignored.

     -r    Print the current runlevel.  This is meaningless on Mac OS X.

     -s    List only the name, line and time fields.  This is the default.

     -T    Print a character after the user name indicating the state of the
           terminal line: ‘+’ if the terminal is writable; ‘-’ if it is not; and
           ‘?’ if a bad line is encountered.

     -t    Print last system clock change (unsupported).

     -u    Print the idle time for each user, and the associated process ID.

     am I  Returns the invoker's real user name.
