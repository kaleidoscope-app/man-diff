DEBINHEX(1)            User Contributed Perl Documentation           DEBINHEX(1)




NAME
       debinhex.pl - use Convert::BinHex to decode BinHex files

USAGE
       Usage:

           debinhex.pl [options] file ... file

       Where the options are:

           -o dir    Output in given directory (default outputs in file's directory)
           -v        Verbose output (normally just one line per file is shown)

DESCRIPTION
       Each file is expected to be a BinHex file.  By default, the output file
       is given the name that the BinHex file dictates, regardless of the name
       of the BinHex file.

WARNINGS
       Largely untested.

AUTHORS
       Paul J. Schinder (NASA/GSFC) mostly, though Eryq can't seem to keep his
       grubby paws off anything...

       SÃ¶ren M. Andersen (somian), made it actually work under Perl 5.8.7 on
       MSWin32.
