NAME
       ldapcompare - LDAP compare tool

SYNOPSIS
       ldapcompare [-n] [-v] [-z] [-M[M]] [-d_debuglevel] [-D_binddn] [-W]
       [-w_passwd] [-y_passwdfile] [-H_ldapuri] [-h_ldaphost] [-p_ldapport]
       [-P {2|3}] [-e [!]ext[=extparam]] [-E [!]ext[=extparam]]
       [-O_security-properties] [-I] [-Q] [-U_authcid] [-R_realm] [-x]
       [-X_authzid] [-Y_mech] [-Z[Z]] DN {attr:value | attr::b64value}

DESCRIPTION
       ldapcompare is a shell-accessible interface to the ldap_compare_ext(3)
       library call.

       ldapcompare opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds, and performs a
       compare using specified parameters.   The DN should be a distinguished
       name in the directory.  Attr should be a known attribute.  If followed by
       one colon, the assertion value should be provided as a string.  If
       followed by two colons, the base64 encoding of the value is provided.
       The result code of the compare is provided as the exit code and, unless
       ran with -z, the program prints TRUE, FALSE, or UNDEFINED on standard
       output.

OPTIONS
       -n     Show what would be done, but don't actually perform the compare.
              Useful for debugging in conjunction with -v.

       -v     Run in verbose mode, with many diagnostics written to standard
              output.

       -z     Run in quiet mode, no output is written.  You must check the
              return status.  Useful in shell scripts.

       -M[M]  Enable manage DSA IT control.  -MM makes control critical.

       -d_debuglevel
              Set the LDAP debugging level to debuglevel.  ldapcompare must be
              compiled with LDAP_DEBUG defined for this option to have any
              effect.

       -x     Use simple authentication instead of SASL.

       -D_binddn
              Use the Distinguished Name binddn to bind to the LDAP directory.
              For SASL binds, the server is expected to ignore this value.

       -W     Prompt for simple authentication.  This is used instead of
              specifying the password on the command line.

       -w_passwd
              Use passwd as the password for simple authentication.

       -y_passwdfile
              Use complete contents of passwdfile as the password for simple
              authentication.  Note that complete means that any leading or
              trailing whitespaces, including newlines, will be considered part
              of the password and, unlike other software, they will not be
              stripped.  As a consequence, passwords stored in files by commands
              like echo(1) will not behave as expected, since echo(1) by default
              appends a trailing newline to the echoed string.  The recommended
              portable way to store a cleartext password in a file for use with
              this option is to use slappasswd(8) with {CLEARTEXT} as hash and
              the option -n.

       -H_ldapuri
              Specify URI(s) referring to the ldap server(s); only the
              protocol/host/port fields are allowed; a list of URI, separated by
              whitespace or commas is expected.

       -h_ldaphost
              Specify an alternate host on which the ldap server is running.
              Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -p_ldapport
              Specify an alternate TCP port where the ldap server is listening.
              Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -P {2|3}
              Specify the LDAP protocol version to use.

       -e [!]ext[=extparam]

       -E [!]ext[=extparam]

              Specify general extensions with -e and search extensions with -E.
              ´!´ indicates criticality.

              General extensions:
                [!]assert=<filter>   (an RFC 4515 Filter)
                [!]authzid=<authzid> ("dn:<dn>" or "u:<user>")
                [!]manageDSAit
                [!]noop
                ppolicy
                [!]postread[=<attrs>]        (a comma-separated attribute list)
                [!]preread[=<attrs>] (a comma-separated attribute list)
                abandon, cancel (SIGINT sends abandon/cancel; not really controls)

              Search extensions:
                [!]domainScope                               (domain scope)
                [!]mv=<filter>                               (matched values filter)
                [!]pr=<size>[/prompt|noprompt]       (paged results/prompt)
                [!]sss=[-]<attr[:OID]>[/[-]<attr[:OID]>...]  (server side sorting)
                [!]subentries[=true|false]           (subentries)
                [!]sync=ro[/<cookie>]                        (LDAP Sync refreshOnly)
                        rp[/<cookie>][/<slimit>]     (LDAP Sync refreshAndPersist)

       -O_security-properties
              Specify SASL security properties.

       -I     Enable SASL Interactive mode.  Always prompt.  Default is to
              prompt only as needed.

       -Q     Enable SASL Quiet mode.  Never prompt.

       -U_authcid
              Specify the authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of the ID
              depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -R_realm
              Specify the realm of authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of
              the realm depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -X_authzid
              Specify the requested authorization ID for SASL bind.  authzid
              must be one of the following formats: dn:<distinguished name> or
              u:<username>

       -Y_mech
              Specify the SASL mechanism to be used for authentication. If it's
              not specified, the program will choose the best mechanism the
              server knows.

       -Z[Z]  Issue StartTLS (Transport Layer Security) extended operation. If
              you use -ZZ, the command will require the operation to be
              successful.

EXAMPLES
           ldapcompare "uid=babs,dc=example,dc=com"  sn:Jensen
           ldapcompare "uid=babs,dc=example,dc=com"  sn::SmVuc2Vu
       are all equivalent.

LIMITATIONS
       Requiring the value be passed on the command line is limiting and
       introduces some security concerns.  The command should support a
       mechanism to specify the location (file name or URL) to read the value
       from.
