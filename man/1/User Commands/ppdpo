NAME
       ppdpo - ppd message catalog generator (deprecated)

SYNOPSIS
       ppdpo [ -D name[=value] ] [ -I include-directory ] [ -o output-file ]
       source-file

DESCRIPTION
       ppdpo extracts UI strings from PPDC source files and updates either a GNU
       gettext or macOS strings format message catalog source file for
       translation.  This program is deprecated and will be removed in a future
       release of CUPS.

OPTIONS
       ppdpo supports the following options:

       -D name[=value]
            Sets the named variable for use in the source file.  It is
            equivalent to using the #define directive in the source file.

       -I include-directory
            Specifies an alternate include directory.  Multiple -I options can
            be supplied to add additional directories.

       -o output-file
            Specifies the output file.  The supported extensions are .po or
            .po.gz for GNU gettext format message catalogs and .strings for
            macOS strings files.

NOTES
       PPD files are deprecated and will no longer be supported in a future
       feature release of CUPS.  Printers that do not support IPP can be
       supported using applications such as ippeveprinter(1).
