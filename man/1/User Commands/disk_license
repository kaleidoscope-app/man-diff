DISK_LICENSE(1)              General Commands Manual             DISK_LICENSE(1)



NAME
       disk_license - Disk License Tool

SYNOPSIS
       disk_license [-hHqrsvX] [-dn][-ffilename][-H][-Fformat]

       disk_license [-idiskcatalog]

DESCRIPTION
       disk_license is used to interrogate disk drives, StorNext disk licenses
       and the Quantum Disk Catalog.  It can report current disk licensing
       status and create reports for manually requesting disk licenses on an
       MDC.

       All the disks in all of an MDC's file systems are categorized into
       Quantum Branded, Quantum Certified, and Uncertified (all other) as
       defined in the quantum_disk_catalog.dat database.

       The Disk Usage licenses are free, but aid Quantum support in
       understanding the usage and requirements of a site.

OPTIONS
       -c <filename>
              Use catalog <filename> instead of the default disk-license-request
              report file.

       -C     Only print the Disk Catalog to standard out.

       -d <n> Print additional details on a per-file-system basis.  Larger
              values for <n> yield more details, up to a point.

       -f <filename>
              Send reports to the file <filename>.

       -F format
              Print the output in format <format>.  Supported formats are:
              ascii, xml, and json.

       -h     Print the command's usage message and quit.

       -H     Display capacity values in human readable, terabyte values (only
              for ASCII format).

       -q     Quiet mode.  Suppress status messages to standard out.

       -R <filename>
              Input a Disk License Request report from <filename>.  This option
              is not available on some platforms.

       -r     Print a Disk License Request report to standard out.

       -s     Print a Disk Usage Summary report to standard out.

       -u     Update the XML file specified with the -R option to the current
              version and format.

       -v     Print additional internal details as the command collects the
              information to categorize the MDC's disks.  Additional v options
              increase the amount of detail.

       -X     Update the default Disk License Request file.  When Disk Usage is
              over licensed capacity, create a periodic RAS message.

       -i diskcatalog
              Import the specified disk catalog when it has a newer generation
              number than the currently installed disk catalog.
