POSTLOCK(1)                  General Commands Manual                 POSTLOCK(1)




NAME
       postlock - lock mail folder and execute command

SYNOPSIS
       postlock [-c config_dir] [-l lock_style]
               [-v] file command...

DESCRIPTION
       The postlock(1) command locks file for exclusive access, and executes
       command. The locking method is compatible with the Postfix UNIX-style
       local delivery agent.

       Options:

       -c config_dir
              Read the main.cf configuration file in the named directory instead
              of the default configuration directory.

       -l lock_style
              Override the locking method specified via the
              mailbox_delivery_lock configuration parameter (see below).

       -v     Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple -v options
              make the software increasingly verbose.

       Arguments:

       file   A mailbox file. The user should have read/write permission.

       command...
              The command to execute while file is locked for exclusive access.
              The command is executed directly, i.e. without interpretation by a
              shell command interpreter.

DIAGNOSTICS
       The result status is 75 (EX_TEMPFAIL) when postlock(1) could not perform
       the requested operation.  Otherwise, the exit status is the exit status
       from the command.

BUGS
       With remote file systems, the ability to acquire a lock does not
       necessarily eliminate access conflicts. Avoid file access by processes
       running on different machines.

ENVIRONMENT

       MAIL_CONFIG
              Directory with Postfix configuration files.

       MAIL_VERBOSE
              Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes.
