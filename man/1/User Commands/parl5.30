PARL(1)                User Contributed Perl Documentation               PARL(1)




NAME
       parl - Binary PAR Loader

SYNOPSIS
       (Please see pp for convenient ways to make self-contained executables,
       scripts or PAR archives from perl programs.)

       To make a PAR distribution from a CPAN module distribution:

           % parl -p                 # make a PAR dist under the current path
           % parl -p Foo-0.01        # assume unpacked CPAN dist in Foo-0.01/

       To manipulate a PAR distribution:

           % parl -i Foo-0.01-i386-freebsd-5.8.0.par   # install
           % parl -i http://foo.com/Foo-0.01           # auto-appends archname + perlver
           % parl -i cpan://AUTRIJUS/PAR-0.74          # uses CPAN author directory
           % parl -u Foo-0.01-i386-freebsd-5.8.0.par   # uninstall
           % parl -s Foo-0.01-i386-freebsd-5.8.0.par   # sign
           % parl -v Foo-0.01-i386-freebsd-5.8.0.par   # verify

       To use Hello.pm from ./foo.par:

           % parl -A./foo.par -MHello
           % parl -A./foo -MHello      # the .par part is optional

       Same thing, but search foo.par in the @INC;

           % parl -Ifoo.par -MHello
           % parl -Ifoo -MHello        # ditto

       Run test.pl or script/test.pl from foo.par:

           % parl foo.par test.pl      # looks for 'main.pl' by default,
                                       # otherwise run 'test.pl'

       To make a self-containing executable containing a PAR file :

           % parl -O./foo foo.par
           % ./foo test.pl             # same as above

       To embed the necessary non-core modules and shared objects for PAR's
       execution (like "Zlib", "IO", "Cwd", etc), use the -b flag:

           % parl -b -O./foo foo.par
           % ./foo test.pl             # runs anywhere with core modules installed

       If you also wish to embed core modules along, use the -B flag instead:

           % parl -B -O./foo foo.par
           % ./foo test.pl             # runs anywhere with the perl interpreter

       This is particularly useful when making stand-alone binary executables;
       see pp for details.

DESCRIPTION
       This stand-alone command offers roughly the same feature as "perl -MPAR",
       except that it takes the pre-loaded .par files via "-Afoo.par" instead of
       "-MPAR=foo.par".

       Additionally, it lets you convert a CPAN distribution to a PAR
       distribution, as well as manipulate such distributions.  For more
       information about PAR distributions, see PAR::Dist.

       You can use it to run .par files:

           # runs script/run.pl in archive, uses its lib/* as libraries
           % parl myapp.par run.pl     # runs run.pl or script/run.pl in myapp.par
           % parl otherapp.pl          # also runs normal perl scripts

       However, if the .par archive contains either main.pl or script/main.pl,
       it is used instead:

           % parl myapp.par run.pl     # runs main.pl, with 'run.pl' as @ARGV

       Finally, the "-O" option makes a stand-alone binary executable from a PAR
       file:

           % parl -B -Omyapp myapp.par
           % ./myapp                   # run it anywhere without perl binaries

       With the "--par-options" flag, generated binaries can act as "parl" to
       pack new binaries:

           % ./myapp --par-options -Omyap2 myapp.par   # identical to ./myapp
           % ./myapp --par-options -Omyap3 myap3.par   # now with different PAR

       For an explanation of stand-alone executable format, please see par.pl.
