GROG(1)                      General Commands Manual                     GROG(1)



NAME
       grog - guess options for groff command

SYNOPSIS
       grog [ -option ... ] [ files_... ]

DESCRIPTION
       grog reads files and guesses which of the groff(1) options -e, -man, -me,
       -mm, -mom, -ms, -mdoc, -mdoc-old, -p, -R, -g, -G, -s, and -t are required
       for printing files, and prints the groff command including those options
       on the standard output.  A filename of - is taken to refer to the
       standard input.  If no files are specified the standard input will be
       read.  Any specified options will be included in the printed command.  No
       space is allowed between options and their arguments.  The only options
       recognized are -C (which is also passed on) to enable compatibility mode,
       and -v to print the version number.

       For example,

              `grog -Tdvi paper.ms`

       will guess the appropriate command to print paper.ms and then run it
       after adding the -Tdvi option.
