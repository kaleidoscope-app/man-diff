NAME
       lpoptions - display or set printer options and defaults

SYNOPSIS
       lpoptions [ -E ] [ -h server[:port] ] -d destination[/instance] [ -l ]
       lpoptions [ -E ] [ -h server[:port] ] [ -p destination[/instance] ] -o
       option[=value] ...
       lpoptions [ -E ] [ -h server[:port] ] [ -p destination[/instance] ] -r
       option
       lpoptions [ -E ] [ -h server[:port] ] -x destination[/instance]

DESCRIPTION
       lpoptions displays or sets printer options and defaults.  If no printer
       is specified using the -p option, the default printer is used as
       described in lp(1).

       If no -l, -o, or -r options are specified, the current options are
       reported on the standard output.

       Options set with the lpoptions command are used by the lp(1) and lpr(1)
       commands when submitting jobs.

       When run by the root user, lpoptions gets and sets default options and
       instances for all users in the /etc/cups/lpoptions file.  Otherwise, the
       per-user defaults are managed in the ~/.cups/lpoptions file.

OPTIONS
       lpoptions supports the following options:

       -E   Enables encryption when communicating with the CUPS server.

       -d destination[/instance]
            Sets the user default printer to destination.  If instance is
            supplied then that particular instance is used.  This option
            overrides the system default printer for the current user.

       -h server[:port]
            Uses an alternate server.

       -l   Lists the printer specific options and their current settings.

       -o option[=value]
            Specifies a new option for the named destination.

       -p destination[/instance]
            Sets the destination and instance, if specified, for any options
            that follow.  If the named instance does not exist then it is
            created.  Destinations can only be created using the lpadmin(8)
            program.

       -r option
            Removes the specified option from the named destination.

       -x destination[/instance]
            Removes the options for the named destination and instance, if
            specified.  If the named instance does not exist then this does
            nothing.  Destinations can only be removed using the lpadmin(8)
            command.

FILES
       ~/.cups/lpoptions - user defaults and instances created by non-root
       users.
       /etc/cups/lpoptions - system-wide defaults and instances created by the
       root user.

CONFORMING TO
       The lpoptions command is unique to CUPS.
