encode_keychange(1)                 Net-SNMP                 encode_keychange(1)



NAME
       encode_keychange - produce the KeyChange string for SNMPv3

SYNOPSIS
       encode_keychange -t md5|sha1 [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       encode_keychange produces a KeyChange string using the old and new
       passphrases as described in Section 5 of RFC 2274 "User-based Security
       Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol
       (SNMPv3)". -t option is mandatory and specifies the hash transform type
       to use.

       The transform is used to convert passphrase to master key for a given
       user (Ku), convert master key to the localized key (Kul), and to hash the
       old Kul with the random bits.

       Passphrases are obtained by examining a number of sources until success
       (in order listed):

              command line options (see -N and -O options below);

              the file $HOME/.snmp/passphrase.ek which should only contain two
              lines with old and new passphrase;

              standard input -or-  user input from the terminal.

OPTIONS
       -E [0x]<engineID> EngineID used for Kul generation.
              <engineID> is intepreted as a hex string when preceeded by 0x,
              otherwise it is treated as a text string. If no <engineID> is
              specified, it is constructed from the first IP address for the
              local host.

       -f     Force passphrases to be read from standard input.

       -h     Display the help message.

       -N "<new_passphrase>"
              Passphrase used to generate the new Ku.

       -O "<old_passphrase>"
              Passphrase used to generate the old Ku.

       -P     Turn off the prompt for passphrases when getting data from
              standard input.

       -v     Be verbose.

       -V     Echo passphrases to terminal.

SEE ALSO
       The localized key method is defined in RFC 2274, Sections 2.6 and A.2,
       and originally documented in

              U. Blumenthal, N. C. Hien, B. Wijnen, "Key Derivation for Network
              Management Applications", IEEE Network Magazine, April/May issue,
