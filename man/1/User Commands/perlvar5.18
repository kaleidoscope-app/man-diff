PERLVAR(1)              Perl Programmers Reference Guide              PERLVAR(1)




NAME
       perlvar - Perl predefined variables

DESCRIPTION
   The Syntax of Variable Names
       Variable names in Perl can have several formats.  Usually, they must
       begin with a letter or underscore, in which case they can be arbitrarily
       long (up to an internal limit of 251 characters) and may contain letters,
       digits, underscores, or the special sequence "::" or "'".  In this case,
       the part before the last "::" or "'" is taken to be a package qualifier;
       see perlmod.

       Perl variable names may also be a sequence of digits or a single
       punctuation or control character.  These names are all reserved for
       special uses by Perl; for example, the all-digits names are used to hold
       data captured by backreferences after a regular expression match.  Perl
       has a special syntax for the single-control-character names: It
       understands "^X" (caret "X") to mean the control-"X" character.  For
       example, the notation $^W (dollar-sign caret "W") is the scalar variable
       whose name is the single character control-"W".  This is better than
       typing a literal control-"W" into your program.

       Since Perl v5.6.0, Perl variable names may be alphanumeric strings that
       begin with control characters (or better yet, a caret).  These variables
       must be written in the form "${^Foo}"; the braces are not optional.
       "${^Foo}" denotes the scalar variable whose name is a control-"F"
       followed by two "o"'s.  These variables are reserved for future special
       uses by Perl, except for the ones that begin with "^_" (control-
       underscore or caret-underscore).  No control-character name that begins
       with "^_" will acquire a special meaning in any future version of Perl;
       such names may therefore be used safely in programs.  $^_ itself,
       however, is reserved.

       Perl identifiers that begin with digits, control characters, or
       punctuation characters are exempt from the effects of the "package"
       declaration and are always forced to be in package "main"; they are also
       exempt from "strict 'vars'" errors.  A few other names are also exempt in
       these ways:

           ENV      STDIN
           INC      STDOUT
           ARGV     STDERR
           ARGVOUT
           SIG

       In particular, the special "${^_XYZ}" variables are always taken to be in
       package "main", regardless of any "package" declarations presently in
       scope.

SPECIAL VARIABLES
       The following names have special meaning to Perl.  Most punctuation names
       have reasonable mnemonics, or analogs in the shells.  Nevertheless, if
       you wish to use long variable names, you need only say:

           use English;

       at the top of your program.  This aliases all the short names to the long
       names in the current package.  Some even have medium names, generally
       borrowed from awk.  To avoid a performance hit, if you don't need the
       $PREMATCH, $MATCH, or $POSTMATCH it's best to use the "English" module
       without them:

           use English '-no_match_vars';

       Before you continue, note the sort order for variables.  In general, we
       first list the variables in case-insensitive, almost-lexigraphical order
       (ignoring the "{" or "^" preceding words, as in "${^UNICODE}" or $^T),
       although $_ and @_ move up to the top of the pile.  For variables with
       the same identifier, we list it in order of scalar, array, hash, and
       bareword.

   General Variables
       $ARG
       $_      The default input and pattern-searching space.  The following
               pairs are equivalent:

                   while (<>) {...}    # equivalent only in while!
                   while (defined($_ = <>)) {...}

                   /^Subject:/
                   $_ =~ /^Subject:/

                   tr/a-z/A-Z/
                   $_ =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/

                   chomp
                   chomp($_)

               Here are the places where Perl will assume $_ even if you don't
               use it:

               •  The following functions use $_ as a default argument:

                  abs, alarm, chomp, chop, chr, chroot, cos, defined, eval,
                  evalbytes, exp, fc, glob, hex, int, lc, lcfirst, length, log,
                  lstat, mkdir, oct, ord, pos, print, printf, quotemeta,
                  readlink, readpipe, ref, require, reverse (in scalar context
                  only), rmdir, say, sin, split (for its second argument), sqrt,
                  stat, study, uc, ucfirst, unlink, unpack.

               •  All file tests ("-f", "-d") except for "-t", which defaults to
                  STDIN. See "-X" in perlfunc

               •  The pattern matching operations "m//", "s///" and "tr///" (aka
                  "y///") when used without an "=~" operator.

               •  The default iterator variable in a "foreach" loop if no other
                  variable is supplied.

               •  The implicit iterator variable in the "grep()" and "map()"
                  functions.

               •  The implicit variable of "given()".

               •  The default place to put the next value or input record when a
                  "<FH>", "readline", "readdir" or "each" operation's result is
                  tested by itself as the sole criterion of a "while" test.
                  Outside a "while" test, this will not happen.

               $_ is by default a global variable.  However, as of perl v5.10.0,
               you can use a lexical version of $_ by declaring it in a file or
               in a block with "my".  Moreover, declaring "our $_" restores the
               global $_ in the current scope.  Though this seemed like a good
               idea at the time it was introduced, lexical $_ actually causes
               more problems than it solves.  If you call a function that
               expects to be passed information via $_, it may or may not work,
               depending on how the function is written, there not being any
               easy way to solve this.  Just avoid lexical $_, unless you are
               feeling particularly masochistic.  For this reason lexical $_ is
               still experimental and will produce a warning unless warnings
               have been disabled.  As with other experimental features, the
               behavior of lexical $_ is subject to change without notice,
               including change into a fatal error.

               Mnemonic: underline is understood in certain operations.

       @ARG
       @_      Within a subroutine the array @_ contains the parameters passed
               to that subroutine.  Inside a subroutine, @_ is the default array
               for the array operators "push", "pop", "shift", and "unshift".

               See perlsub.

       $LIST_SEPARATOR
       $"      When an array or an array slice is interpolated into a double-
               quoted string or a similar context such as "/.../", its elements
               are separated by this value.  Default is a space.  For example,
               this:

                   print "The array is: @array\n";

               is equivalent to this:

                   print "The array is: " . join($", @array) . "\n";

               Mnemonic: works in double-quoted context.

       $PROCESS_ID
       $PID
       $$      The process number of the Perl running this script.  Though you
               can set this variable, doing so is generally discouraged,
               although it can be invaluable for some testing purposes.  It will
               be reset automatically across "fork()" calls.

               Note for Linux and Debian GNU/kFreeBSD users: Before Perl v5.16.0
               perl would emulate POSIX semantics on Linux systems using
               LinuxThreads, a partial implementation of POSIX Threads that has
               since been superseded by the Native POSIX Thread Library (NPTL).

               LinuxThreads is now obsolete on Linux, and caching "getpid()"
               like this made embedding perl unnecessarily complex (since you'd
               have to manually update the value of $$), so now $$ and
               "getppid()" will always return the same values as the underlying
               C library.

               Debian GNU/kFreeBSD systems also used LinuxThreads up until and
               including the 6.0 release, but after that moved to FreeBSD thread
               semantics, which are POSIX-like.

               To see if your system is affected by this discrepancy check if
               "getconf GNU_LIBPTHREAD_VERSION | grep -q NPTL" returns a false
               value. NTPL threads preserve the POSIX semantics.

               Mnemonic: same as shells.

       $PROGRAM_NAME
       $0      Contains the name of the program being executed.

               On some (but not all) operating systems assigning to $0 modifies
               the argument area that the "ps" program sees.  On some platforms
               you may have to use special "ps" options or a different "ps" to
               see the changes.  Modifying the $0 is more useful as a way of
               indicating the current program state than it is for hiding the
               program you're running.

               Note that there are platform-specific limitations on the maximum
               length of $0.  In the most extreme case it may be limited to the
               space occupied by the original $0.

               In some platforms there may be arbitrary amount of padding, for
               example space characters, after the modified name as shown by
               "ps".  In some platforms this padding may extend all the way to
               the original length of the argument area, no matter what you do
               (this is the case for example with Linux 2.2).

               Note for BSD users: setting $0 does not completely remove "perl"
               from the ps(1) output.  For example, setting $0 to "foobar" may
               result in "perl: foobar (perl)" (whether both the "perl: " prefix
               and the " (perl)" suffix are shown depends on your exact BSD
               variant and version).  This is an operating system feature, Perl
               cannot help it.

               In multithreaded scripts Perl coordinates the threads so that any
               thread may modify its copy of the $0 and the change becomes
               visible to ps(1) (assuming the operating system plays along).
               Note that the view of $0 the other threads have will not change
               since they have their own copies of it.

               If the program has been given to perl via the switches "-e" or
               "-E", $0 will contain the string "-e".

               On Linux as of perl v5.14.0 the legacy process name will be set
               with prctl(2), in addition to altering the POSIX name via
               "argv[0]" as perl has done since version 4.000.  Now system
               utilities that read the legacy process name such as ps, top and
               killall will recognize the name you set when assigning to $0.
               The string you supply will be cut off at 16 bytes, this is a
               limitation imposed by Linux.

               Mnemonic: same as sh and ksh.

       $REAL_GROUP_ID
       $GID
       $(      The real gid of this process.  If you are on a machine that
               supports membership in multiple groups simultaneously, gives a
               space separated list of groups you are in.  The first number is
               the one returned by "getgid()", and the subsequent ones by
               "getgroups()", one of which may be the same as the first number.

               However, a value assigned to $( must be a single number used to
               set the real gid.  So the value given by $( should not be
               assigned back to $( without being forced numeric, such as by
               adding zero.  Note that this is different to the effective gid
               ($)) which does take a list.

               You can change both the real gid and the effective gid at the
               same time by using "POSIX::setgid()".  Changes to $( require a
               check to $! to detect any possible errors after an attempted
               change.

               Mnemonic: parentheses are used to group things.  The real gid is
               the group you left, if you're running setgid.

       $EFFECTIVE_GROUP_ID
       $EGID
       $)      The effective gid of this process.  If you are on a machine that
               supports membership in multiple groups simultaneously, gives a
               space separated list of groups you are in.  The first number is
               the one returned by "getegid()", and the subsequent ones by
               "getgroups()", one of which may be the same as the first number.

               Similarly, a value assigned to $) must also be a space-separated
               list of numbers.  The first number sets the effective gid, and
               the rest (if any) are passed to "setgroups()".  To get the effect
               of an empty list for "setgroups()", just repeat the new effective
               gid; that is, to force an effective gid of 5 and an effectively
               empty "setgroups()" list, say " $) = "5 5" ".

               You can change both the effective gid and the real gid at the
               same time by using "POSIX::setgid()" (use only a single numeric
               argument).  Changes to $) require a check to $! to detect any
               possible errors after an attempted change.

               $<, $>, $( and $) can be set only on machines that support the
               corresponding set[re][ug]id() routine.  $( and $) can be swapped
               only on machines supporting "setregid()".

               Mnemonic: parentheses are used to group things.  The effective
               gid is the group that's right for you, if you're running setgid.

       $REAL_USER_ID
       $UID
       $<      The real uid of this process.  You can change both the real uid
               and the effective uid at the same time by using
               "POSIX::setuid()".  Since changes to $< require a system call,
               check $! after a change attempt to detect any possible errors.

               Mnemonic: it's the uid you came from, if you're running setuid.

       $EFFECTIVE_USER_ID
       $EUID
       $>      The effective uid of this process.  For example:

                   $< = $>;            # set real to effective uid
                   ($<,$>) = ($>,$<);  # swap real and effective uids

               You can change both the effective uid and the real uid at the
               same time by using "POSIX::setuid()".  Changes to $> require a
               check to $! to detect any possible errors after an attempted
               change.

               $< and $> can be swapped only on machines supporting
               "setreuid()".

               Mnemonic: it's the uid you went to, if you're running setuid.

       $SUBSCRIPT_SEPARATOR
       $SUBSEP
       $;      The subscript separator for multidimensional array emulation.  If
               you refer to a hash element as

                   $foo{$a,$b,$c}

               it really means

                   $foo{join($;, $a, $b, $c)}

               But don't put

                   @foo{$a,$b,$c}      # a slice--note the @

               which means

                   ($foo{$a},$foo{$b},$foo{$c})

               Default is "\034", the same as SUBSEP in awk.  If your keys
               contain binary data there might not be any safe value for $;.

               Consider using "real" multidimensional arrays as described in
               perllol.

               Mnemonic: comma (the syntactic subscript separator) is a semi-
               semicolon.

       $a
       $b      Special package variables when using "sort()", see "sort" in
               perlfunc.  Because of this specialness $a and $b don't need to be
               declared (using "use vars", or "our()") even when using the
               "strict 'vars'" pragma.  Don't lexicalize them with "my $a" or
               "my $b" if you want to be able to use them in the "sort()"
               comparison block or function.

       %ENV    The hash %ENV contains your current environment.  Setting a value
               in "ENV" changes the environment for any child processes you
               subsequently "fork()" off.

       $SYSTEM_FD_MAX
       $^F     The maximum system file descriptor, ordinarily 2.  System file
               descriptors are passed to "exec()"ed processes, while higher file
               descriptors are not.  Also, during an "open()", system file
               descriptors are preserved even if the "open()" fails (ordinary
               file descriptors are closed before the "open()" is attempted).
               The close-on-exec status of a file descriptor will be decided
               according to the value of $^F when the corresponding file, pipe,
               or socket was opened, not the time of the "exec()".

       @F      The array @F contains the fields of each line read in when
               autosplit mode is turned on.  See perlrun for the -a switch.
               This array is package-specific, and must be declared or given a
               full package name if not in package main when running under
               "strict 'vars'".

       @INC    The array @INC contains the list of places that the "do EXPR",
               "require", or "use" constructs look for their library files.  It
               initially consists of the arguments to any -I command-line
               switches, followed by the default Perl library, probably
               /usr/local/lib/perl, followed by ".", to represent the current
               directory.  ("." will not be appended if taint checks are
               enabled, either by "-T" or by "-t".)  If you need to modify this
               at runtime, you should use the "use lib" pragma to get the
               machine-dependent library properly loaded also:

                   use lib '/mypath/libdir/';
                   use SomeMod;

               You can also insert hooks into the file inclusion system by
               putting Perl code directly into @INC.  Those hooks may be
               subroutine references, array references or blessed objects.  See
               "require" in perlfunc for details.

       %INC    The hash %INC contains entries for each filename included via the
               "do", "require", or "use" operators.  The key is the filename you
               specified (with module names converted to pathnames), and the
               value is the location of the file found.  The "require" operator
               uses this hash to determine whether a particular file has already
               been included.

               If the file was loaded via a hook (e.g. a subroutine reference,
               see "require" in perlfunc for a description of these hooks), this
               hook is by default inserted into %INC in place of a filename.
               Note, however, that the hook may have set the %INC entry by
               itself to provide some more specific info.

       $INPLACE_EDIT
       $^I     The current value of the inplace-edit extension.  Use "undef" to
               disable inplace editing.

               Mnemonic: value of -i switch.

       $^M     By default, running out of memory is an untrappable, fatal error.
               However, if suitably built, Perl can use the contents of $^M as
               an emergency memory pool after "die()"ing.  Suppose that your
               Perl were compiled with "-DPERL_EMERGENCY_SBRK" and used Perl's
               malloc.  Then

                   $^M = 'a' x (1 << 16);

               would allocate a 64K buffer for use in an emergency.  See the
               INSTALL file in the Perl distribution for information on how to
               add custom C compilation flags when compiling perl.  To
               discourage casual use of this advanced feature, there is no
               English long name for this variable.

               This variable was added in Perl 5.004.

       $OSNAME
       $^O     The name of the operating system under which this copy of Perl
               was built, as determined during the configuration process.  For
               examples see "PLATFORMS" in perlport.

               The value is identical to $Config{'osname'}.  See also Config and
               the -V command-line switch documented in perlrun.

               In Windows platforms, $^O is not very helpful: since it is always
               "MSWin32", it doesn't tell the difference between
               95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP/CE/.NET.  Use "Win32::GetOSName()" or
               Win32::GetOSVersion() (see Win32 and perlport) to distinguish
               between the variants.

               This variable was added in Perl 5.003.

       %SIG    The hash %SIG contains signal handlers for signals.  For example:

                   sub handler {   # 1st argument is signal name
                       my($sig) = @_;
                       print "Caught a SIG$sig--shutting down\n";
                       close(LOG);
                       exit(0);
                       }

                   $SIG{'INT'}  = \&handler;
                   $SIG{'QUIT'} = \&handler;
                   ...
                   $SIG{'INT'}  = 'DEFAULT';   # restore default action
                   $SIG{'QUIT'} = 'IGNORE';    # ignore SIGQUIT

               Using a value of 'IGNORE' usually has the effect of ignoring the
               signal, except for the "CHLD" signal.  See perlipc for more about
               this special case.

               Here are some other examples:

                   $SIG{"PIPE"} = "Plumber";   # assumes main::Plumber (not
                                               # recommended)
                   $SIG{"PIPE"} = \&Plumber;   # just fine; assume current
                                               # Plumber
                   $SIG{"PIPE"} = *Plumber;    # somewhat esoteric
                   $SIG{"PIPE"} = Plumber();   # oops, what did Plumber()
                                               # return??

               Be sure not to use a bareword as the name of a signal handler,
               lest you inadvertently call it.

               If your system has the "sigaction()" function then signal
               handlers are installed using it.  This means you get reliable
               signal handling.

               The default delivery policy of signals changed in Perl v5.8.0
               from immediate (also known as "unsafe") to deferred, also known
               as "safe signals".  See perlipc for more information.

               Certain internal hooks can be also set using the %SIG hash.  The
               routine indicated by $SIG{__WARN__} is called when a warning
               message is about to be printed.  The warning message is passed as
               the first argument.  The presence of a "__WARN__" hook causes the
               ordinary printing of warnings to "STDERR" to be suppressed.  You
               can use this to save warnings in a variable, or turn warnings
               into fatal errors, like this:

                   local $SIG{__WARN__} = sub { die $_[0] };
                   eval $proggie;

               As the 'IGNORE' hook is not supported by "__WARN__", you can
               disable warnings using the empty subroutine:

                   local $SIG{__WARN__} = sub {};

               The routine indicated by $SIG{__DIE__} is called when a fatal
               exception is about to be thrown.  The error message is passed as
               the first argument.  When a "__DIE__" hook routine returns, the
               exception processing continues as it would have in the absence of
               the hook, unless the hook routine itself exits via a "goto &sub",
               a loop exit, or a "die()".  The "__DIE__" handler is explicitly
               disabled during the call, so that you can die from a "__DIE__"
               handler.  Similarly for "__WARN__".

               Due to an implementation glitch, the $SIG{__DIE__} hook is called
               even inside an "eval()".  Do not use this to rewrite a pending
               exception in $@, or as a bizarre substitute for overriding
               "CORE::GLOBAL::die()".  This strange action at a distance may be
               fixed in a future release so that $SIG{__DIE__} is only called if
               your program is about to exit, as was the original intent.  Any
               other use is deprecated.

               "__DIE__"/"__WARN__" handlers are very special in one respect:
               they may be called to report (probable) errors found by the
               parser.  In such a case the parser may be in inconsistent state,
               so any attempt to evaluate Perl code from such a handler will
               probably result in a segfault.  This means that warnings or
               errors that result from parsing Perl should be used with extreme
               caution, like this:

                   require Carp if defined $^S;
                   Carp::confess("Something wrong") if defined &Carp::confess;
                   die "Something wrong, but could not load Carp to give "
                     . "backtrace...\n\t"
                     . "To see backtrace try starting Perl with -MCarp switch";

               Here the first line will load "Carp" unless it is the parser who
               called the handler.  The second line will print backtrace and die
               if "Carp" was available.  The third line will be executed only if
               "Carp" was not available.

               Having to even think about the $^S variable in your exception
               handlers is simply wrong.  $SIG{__DIE__} as currently implemented
               invites grievous and difficult to track down errors.  Avoid it
               and use an "END{}" or CORE::GLOBAL::die override instead.

               See "die" in perlfunc, "warn" in perlfunc, "eval" in perlfunc,
               and warnings for additional information.

       $BASETIME
       $^T     The time at which the program began running, in seconds since the
               epoch (beginning of 1970).  The values returned by the -M, -A,
               and -C filetests are based on this value.

       $PERL_VERSION
       $^V     The revision, version, and subversion of the Perl interpreter,
               represented as a "version" object.

               This variable first appeared in perl v5.6.0; earlier versions of
               perl will see an undefined value.  Before perl v5.10.0 $^V was
               represented as a v-string.

               $^V can be used to determine whether the Perl interpreter
               executing a script is in the right range of versions.  For
               example:

                   warn "Hashes not randomized!\n" if !$^V or $^V lt v5.8.1

               To convert $^V into its string representation use "sprintf()"'s
               "%vd" conversion:

                   printf "version is v%vd\n", $^V;  # Perl's version

               See the documentation of "use VERSION" and "require VERSION" for
               a convenient way to fail if the running Perl interpreter is too
               old.

               See also $] for an older representation of the Perl version.

               This variable was added in Perl v5.6.0.

               Mnemonic: use ^V for Version Control.

       ${^WIN32_SLOPPY_STAT}
               If this variable is set to a true value, then "stat()" on Windows
               will not try to open the file.  This means that the link count
               cannot be determined and file attributes may be out of date if
               additional hardlinks to the file exist.  On the other hand, not
               opening the file is considerably faster, especially for files on
               network drives.

               This variable could be set in the sitecustomize.pl file to
               configure the local Perl installation to use "sloppy" "stat()" by
               default.  See the documentation for -f in perlrun for more
               information about site customization.

               This variable was added in Perl v5.10.0.

       $EXECUTABLE_NAME
       $^X     The name used to execute the current copy of Perl, from C's
               "argv[0]" or (where supported) /proc/self/exe.

               Depending on the host operating system, the value of $^X may be a
               relative or absolute pathname of the perl program file, or may be
               the string used to invoke perl but not the pathname of the perl
               program file.  Also, most operating systems permit invoking
               programs that are not in the PATH environment variable, so there
               is no guarantee that the value of $^X is in PATH.  For VMS, the
               value may or may not include a version number.

               You usually can use the value of $^X to re-invoke an independent
               copy of the same perl that is currently running, e.g.,

                   @first_run = `$^X -le "print int rand 100 for 1..100"`;

               But recall that not all operating systems support forking or
               capturing of the output of commands, so this complex statement
               may not be portable.

               It is not safe to use the value of $^X as a path name of a file,
               as some operating systems that have a mandatory suffix on
               executable files do not require use of the suffix when invoking a
               command.  To convert the value of $^X to a path name, use the
               following statements:

                   # Build up a set of file names (not command names).
                   use Config;
                   my $this_perl = $^X;
                   if ($^O ne 'VMS') {
                       $this_perl .= $Config{_exe}
                         unless $this_perl =~ m/$Config{_exe}$/i;
                       }

               Because many operating systems permit anyone with read access to
               the Perl program file to make a copy of it, patch the copy, and
               then execute the copy, the security-conscious Perl programmer
               should take care to invoke the installed copy of perl, not the
               copy referenced by $^X.  The following statements accomplish this
               goal, and produce a pathname that can be invoked as a command or
               referenced as a file.

                   use Config;
                   my $secure_perl_path = $Config{perlpath};
                   if ($^O ne 'VMS') {
                       $secure_perl_path .= $Config{_exe}
                           unless $secure_perl_path =~ m/$Config{_exe}$/i;
                       }

   Variables related to regular expressions
       Most of the special variables related to regular expressions are side
       effects.  Perl sets these variables when it has a successful match, so
       you should check the match result before using them.  For instance:

           if( /P(A)TT(ER)N/ ) {
               print "I found $1 and $2\n";
               }

       These variables are read-only and dynamically-scoped, unless we note
       otherwise.

       The dynamic nature of the regular expression variables means that their
       value is limited to the block that they are in, as demonstrated by this
       bit of code:

           my $outer = 'Wallace and Grommit';
           my $inner = 'Mutt and Jeff';

           my $pattern = qr/(\S+) and (\S+)/;

           sub show_n { print "\$1 is $1; \$2 is $2\n" }

           {
           OUTER:
               show_n() if $outer =~ m/$pattern/;

               INNER: {
                   show_n() if $inner =~ m/$pattern/;
                   }

               show_n();
           }

       The output shows that while in the "OUTER" block, the values of $1 and $2
       are from the match against $outer.  Inside the "INNER" block, the values
       of $1 and $2 are from the match against $inner, but only until the end of
       the block (i.e. the dynamic scope).  After the "INNER" block completes,
       the values of $1 and $2 return to the values for the match against $outer
       even though we have not made another match:

           $1 is Wallace; $2 is Grommit
           $1 is Mutt; $2 is Jeff
           $1 is Wallace; $2 is Grommit

       Due to an unfortunate accident of Perl's implementation, "use English"
       imposes a considerable performance penalty on all regular expression
       matches in a program because it uses the "$`", $&, and "$'", regardless
       of whether they occur in the scope of "use English".  For that reason,
       saying "use English" in libraries is strongly discouraged unless you
       import it without the match variables:

           use English '-no_match_vars'

       The "Devel::NYTProf" and "Devel::FindAmpersand" modules can help you find
       uses of these problematic match variables in your code.

       Since Perl v5.10.0, you can use the "/p" match operator flag and the
       "${^PREMATCH}", "${^MATCH}", and "${^POSTMATCH}" variables instead so you
       only suffer the performance penalties.

       $<digits> ($1, $2, ...)
               Contains the subpattern from the corresponding set of capturing
               parentheses from the last successful pattern match, not counting
               patterns matched in nested blocks that have been exited already.

               These variables are read-only and dynamically-scoped.

               Mnemonic: like \digits.

       $MATCH
       $&      The string matched by the last successful pattern match (not
               counting any matches hidden within a BLOCK or "eval()" enclosed
               by the current BLOCK).

               The use of this variable anywhere in a program imposes a
               considerable performance penalty on all regular expression
               matches.  To avoid this penalty, you can extract the same
               substring by using "@-".  Starting with Perl v5.10.0, you can use
               the "/p" match flag and the "${^MATCH}" variable to do the same
               thing for particular match operations.

               This variable is read-only and dynamically-scoped.

               Mnemonic: like "&" in some editors.

       ${^MATCH}
               This is similar to $& ($MATCH) except that it does not incur the
               performance penalty associated with that variable, and is only
               guaranteed to return a defined value when the pattern was
               compiled or executed with the "/p" modifier.

               This variable was added in Perl v5.10.0.

               This variable is read-only and dynamically-scoped.

       $PREMATCH
       $`      The string preceding whatever was matched by the last successful
               pattern match, not counting any matches hidden within a BLOCK or
               "eval" enclosed by the current BLOCK.

               The use of this variable anywhere in a program imposes a
               considerable performance penalty on all regular expression
               matches.  To avoid this penalty, you can extract the same
               substring by using "@-".  Starting with Perl v5.10.0, you can use
               the "/p" match flag and the "${^PREMATCH}" variable to do the
               same thing for particular match operations.

               This variable is read-only and dynamically-scoped.

               Mnemonic: "`" often precedes a quoted string.

       ${^PREMATCH}
               This is similar to "$`" ($PREMATCH) except that it does not incur
               the performance penalty associated with that variable, and is
               only guaranteed to return a defined value when the pattern was
               compiled or executed with the "/p" modifier.

               This variable was added in Perl v5.10.0

               This variable is read-only and dynamically-scoped.

       $POSTMATCH
       $'      The string following whatever was matched by the last successful
               pattern match (not counting any matches hidden within a BLOCK or
               "eval()" enclosed by the current BLOCK).  Example:

                   local $_ = 'abcdefghi';
                   /def/;
                   print "$`:$&:$'\n";         # prints abc:def:ghi

               The use of this variable anywhere in a program imposes a
               considerable performance penalty on all regular expression
               matches.  To avoid this penalty, you can extract the same
               substring by using "@-".  Starting with Perl v5.10.0, you can use
               the "/p" match flag and the "${^POSTMATCH}" variable to do the
               same thing for particular match operations.

               This variable is read-only and dynamically-scoped.

               Mnemonic: "'" often follows a quoted string.

       ${^POSTMATCH}
               This is similar to "$'" ($POSTMATCH) except that it does not
               incur the performance penalty associated with that variable, and
               is only guaranteed to return a defined value when the pattern was
               compiled or executed with the "/p" modifier.

               This variable was added in Perl v5.10.0.

               This variable is read-only and dynamically-scoped.

       $LAST_PAREN_MATCH
       $+      The text matched by the last bracket of the last successful
               search pattern.  This is useful if you don't know which one of a
               set of alternative patterns matched.  For example:

                   /Version: (.*)|Revision: (.*)/ && ($rev = $+);

               This variable is read-only and dynamically-scoped.

               Mnemonic: be positive and forward looking.

       $LAST_SUBMATCH_RESULT
       $^N     The text matched by the used group most-recently closed (i.e. the
               group with the rightmost closing parenthesis) of the last
               successful search pattern.

               This is primarily used inside "(?{...})" blocks for examining
               text recently matched.  For example, to effectively capture text
               to a variable (in addition to $1, $2, etc.), replace "(...)" with

                   (?:(...)(?{ $var = $^N }))

               By setting and then using $var in this way relieves you from
               having to worry about exactly which numbered set of parentheses
               they are.

               This variable was added in Perl v5.8.0.

               Mnemonic: the (possibly) Nested parenthesis that most recently
               closed.

       @LAST_MATCH_END
       @+      This array holds the offsets of the ends of the last successful
               submatches in the currently active dynamic scope.  $+[0] is the
               offset into the string of the end of the entire match.  This is
               the same value as what the "pos" function returns when called on
               the variable that was matched against.  The nth element of this
               array holds the offset of the nth submatch, so $+[1] is the
               offset past where $1 ends, $+[2] the offset past where $2 ends,
               and so on.  You can use $#+ to determine how many subgroups were
               in the last successful match.  See the examples given for the
               "@-" variable.

               This variable was added in Perl v5.6.0.

       %LAST_PAREN_MATCH
       %+      Similar to "@+", the "%+" hash allows access to the named capture
               buffers, should they exist, in the last successful match in the
               currently active dynamic scope.

               For example, $+{foo} is equivalent to $1 after the following
               match:

                   'foo' =~ /(?<foo>foo)/;

               The keys of the "%+" hash list only the names of buffers that
               have captured (and that are thus associated to defined values).

               The underlying behaviour of "%+" is provided by the
               Tie::Hash::NamedCapture module.

               Note: "%-" and "%+" are tied views into a common internal hash
               associated with the last successful regular expression.
               Therefore mixing iterative access to them via "each" may have
               unpredictable results.  Likewise, if the last successful match
               changes, then the results may be surprising.

               This variable was added in Perl v5.10.0.

               This variable is read-only and dynamically-scoped.

       @LAST_MATCH_START
       @-      "$-[0]" is the offset of the start of the last successful match.
               "$-["n"]" is the offset of the start of the substring matched by
               n-th subpattern, or undef if the subpattern did not match.

               Thus, after a match against $_, $& coincides with "substr $_,
               $-[0], $+[0] - $-[0]".  Similarly, $n coincides with "substr $_,
               $-[n], $+[n] - $-[n]" if "$-[n]" is defined, and $+ coincides
               with "substr $_, $-[$#-], $+[$#-] - $-[$#-]".  One can use "$#-"
               to find the last matched subgroup in the last successful match.
               Contrast with $#+, the number of subgroups in the regular
               expression.  Compare with "@+".

               This array holds the offsets of the beginnings of the last
               successful submatches in the currently active dynamic scope.
               "$-[0]" is the offset into the string of the beginning of the
               entire match.  The nth element of this array holds the offset of
               the nth submatch, so "$-[1]" is the offset where $1 begins,
               "$-[2]" the offset where $2 begins, and so on.

               After a match against some variable $var:

               "$`" is the same as "substr($var, 0, $-[0])"
               $& is the same as "substr($var, $-[0], $+[0] - $-[0])"
               "$'" is the same as "substr($var, $+[0])"
               $1 is the same as "substr($var, $-[1], $+[1] - $-[1])"
               $2 is the same as "substr($var, $-[2], $+[2] - $-[2])"
               $3 is the same as "substr($var, $-[3], $+[3] - $-[3])"

               This variable was added in Perl v5.6.0.

       %LAST_MATCH_START
       %-      Similar to "%+", this variable allows access to the named capture
               groups in the last successful match in the currently active
               dynamic scope.  To each capture group name found in the regular
               expression, it associates a reference to an array containing the
               list of values captured by all buffers with that name (should
               there be several of them), in the order where they appear.

               Here's an example:

                   if ('1234' =~ /(?<A>1)(?<B>2)(?<A>3)(?<B>4)/) {
                       foreach my $bufname (sort keys %-) {
                           my $ary = $-{$bufname};
                           foreach my $idx (0..$#$ary) {
                               print "\$-{$bufname}[$idx] : ",
                                     (defined($ary->[$idx])
                                         ? "'$ary->[$idx]'"
                                         : "undef"),
                                     "\n";
                           }
                       }
                   }

               would print out:

                   $-{A}[0] : '1'
                   $-{A}[1] : '3'
                   $-{B}[0] : '2'
                   $-{B}[1] : '4'

               The keys of the "%-" hash correspond to all buffer names found in
               the regular expression.

               The behaviour of "%-" is implemented via the
               Tie::Hash::NamedCapture module.

               Note: "%-" and "%+" are tied views into a common internal hash
               associated with the last successful regular expression.
               Therefore mixing iterative access to them via "each" may have
               unpredictable results.  Likewise, if the last successful match
               changes, then the results may be surprising.

               This variable was added in Perl v5.10.0.

               This variable is read-only and dynamically-scoped.

       $LAST_REGEXP_CODE_RESULT
       $^R     The result of evaluation of the last successful "(?{ code })"
               regular expression assertion (see perlre).  May be written to.

               This variable was added in Perl 5.005.

       ${^RE_DEBUG_FLAGS}
               The current value of the regex debugging flags.  Set to 0 for no
               debug output even when the "re 'debug'" module is loaded.  See re
               for details.

               This variable was added in Perl v5.10.0.

       ${^RE_TRIE_MAXBUF}
               Controls how certain regex optimisations are applied and how much
               memory they utilize.  This value by default is 65536 which
               corresponds to a 512kB temporary cache.  Set this to a higher
               value to trade memory for speed when matching large alternations.
               Set it to a lower value if you want the optimisations to be as
               conservative of memory as possible but still occur, and set it to
               a negative value to prevent the optimisation and conserve the
               most memory.  Under normal situations this variable should be of
               no interest to you.

               This variable was added in Perl v5.10.0.

   Variables related to filehandles
       Variables that depend on the currently selected filehandle may be set by
       calling an appropriate object method on the "IO::Handle" object, although
       this is less efficient than using the regular built-in variables.
       (Summary lines below for this contain the word HANDLE.) First you must
       say

           use IO::Handle;

       after which you may use either

           method HANDLE EXPR

       or more safely,

           HANDLE->method(EXPR)

       Each method returns the old value of the "IO::Handle" attribute.  The
       methods each take an optional EXPR, which, if supplied, specifies the new
       value for the "IO::Handle" attribute in question.  If not supplied, most
       methods do nothing to the current value--except for "autoflush()", which
       will assume a 1 for you, just to be different.

       Because loading in the "IO::Handle" class is an expensive operation, you
       should learn how to use the regular built-in variables.

       A few of these variables are considered "read-only".  This means that if
       you try to assign to this variable, either directly or indirectly through
       a reference, you'll raise a run-time exception.

       You should be very careful when modifying the default values of most
       special variables described in this document.  In most cases you want to
       localize these variables before changing them, since if you don't, the
       change may affect other modules which rely on the default values of the
       special variables that you have changed.  This is one of the correct ways
       to read the whole file at once:

           open my $fh, "<", "foo" or die $!;
           local $/; # enable localized slurp mode
           my $content = <$fh>;
           close $fh;

       But the following code is quite bad:

           open my $fh, "<", "foo" or die $!;
           undef $/; # enable slurp mode
           my $content = <$fh>;
           close $fh;

       since some other module, may want to read data from some file in the
       default "line mode", so if the code we have just presented has been
       executed, the global value of $/ is now changed for any other code
       running inside the same Perl interpreter.

       Usually when a variable is localized you want to make sure that this
       change affects the shortest scope possible.  So unless you are already
       inside some short "{}" block, you should create one yourself.  For
       example:

           my $content = '';
           open my $fh, "<", "foo" or die $!;
           {
               local $/;
               $content = <$fh>;
           }
           close $fh;

       Here is an example of how your own code can go broken:

           for ( 1..3 ){
               $\ = "\r\n";
               nasty_break();
               print "$_";
           }

           sub nasty_break {
               $\ = "\f";
               # do something with $_
           }

       You probably expect this code to print the equivalent of

           "1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n"

       but instead you get:

           "1\f2\f3\f"

       Why? Because "nasty_break()" modifies "$\" without localizing it first.
       The value you set in  "nasty_break()" is still there when you return.
       The fix is to add "local()" so the value doesn't leak out of
       "nasty_break()":

           local $\ = "\f";

       It's easy to notice the problem in such a short example, but in more
       complicated code you are looking for trouble if you don't localize
       changes to the special variables.

       $ARGV   Contains the name of the current file when reading from "<>".

       @ARGV   The array @ARGV contains the command-line arguments intended for
               the script.  $#ARGV is generally the number of arguments minus
               one, because $ARGV[0] is the first argument, not the program's
               command name itself.  See "$0" for the command name.

       ARGV    The special filehandle that iterates over command-line filenames
               in @ARGV.  Usually written as the null filehandle in the angle
               operator "<>".  Note that currently "ARGV" only has its magical
               effect within the "<>" operator; elsewhere it is just a plain
               filehandle corresponding to the last file opened by "<>".  In
               particular, passing "\*ARGV" as a parameter to a function that
               expects a filehandle may not cause your function to automatically
               read the contents of all the files in @ARGV.

       ARGVOUT The special filehandle that points to the currently open output
               file when doing edit-in-place processing with -i.  Useful when
               you have to do a lot of inserting and don't want to keep
               modifying $_.  See perlrun for the -i switch.

       IO::Handle->output_field_separator( EXPR )
       $OUTPUT_FIELD_SEPARATOR
       $OFS
       $,      The output field separator for the print operator.  If defined,
               this value is printed between each of print's arguments.  Default
               is "undef".

               You cannot call "output_field_separator()" on a handle, only as a
               static method.  See IO::Handle.

               Mnemonic: what is printed when there is a "," in your print
               statement.

       HANDLE->input_line_number( EXPR )
       $INPUT_LINE_NUMBER
       $NR
       $.      Current line number for the last filehandle accessed.

               Each filehandle in Perl counts the number of lines that have been
               read from it.  (Depending on the value of $/, Perl's idea of what
               constitutes a line may not match yours.)  When a line is read
               from a filehandle (via "readline()" or "<>"), or when "tell()" or
               "seek()" is called on it, $. becomes an alias to the line counter
               for that filehandle.

               You can adjust the counter by assigning to $., but this will not
               actually move the seek pointer.  Localizing $. will not localize
               the filehandle's line count.  Instead, it will localize perl's
               notion of which filehandle $. is currently aliased to.

               $. is reset when the filehandle is closed, but not when an open
               filehandle is reopened without an intervening "close()".  For
               more details, see "I/O Operators" in perlop.  Because "<>" never
               does an explicit close, line numbers increase across "ARGV" files
               (but see examples in "eof" in perlfunc).

               You can also use "HANDLE->input_line_number(EXPR)" to access the
               line counter for a given filehandle without having to worry about
               which handle you last accessed.

               Mnemonic: many programs use "." to mean the current line number.

       IO::Handle->input_record_separator( EXPR )
       $INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR
       $RS
       $/      The input record separator, newline by default.  This influences
               Perl's idea of what a "line" is.  Works like awk's RS variable,
               including treating empty lines as a terminator if set to the null
               string (an empty line cannot contain any spaces or tabs).  You
               may set it to a multi-character string to match a multi-character
               terminator, or to "undef" to read through the end of file.
               Setting it to "\n\n" means something slightly different than
               setting to "", if the file contains consecutive empty lines.
               Setting to "" will treat two or more consecutive empty lines as a
               single empty line.  Setting to "\n\n" will blindly assume that
               the next input character belongs to the next paragraph, even if
               it's a newline.

                   local $/;           # enable "slurp" mode
                   local $_ = <FH>;    # whole file now here
                   s/\n[ \t]+/ /g;

               Remember: the value of $/ is a string, not a regex.  awk has to
               be better for something. :-)

               Setting $/ to a reference to an integer, scalar containing an
               integer, or scalar that's convertible to an integer will attempt
               to read records instead of lines, with the maximum record size
               being the referenced integer number of characters.  So this:

                   local $/ = \32768; # or \"32768", or \$var_containing_32768
                   open my $fh, "<", $myfile or die $!;
                   local $_ = <$fh>;

               will read a record of no more than 32768 characters from $fh.  If
               you're not reading from a record-oriented file (or your OS
               doesn't have record-oriented files), then you'll likely get a
               full chunk of data with every read.  If a record is larger than
               the record size you've set, you'll get the record back in pieces.
               Trying to set the record size to zero or less will cause reading
               in the (rest of the) whole file.

               On VMS only, record reads bypass PerlIO layers and any associated
               buffering, so you must not mix record and non-record reads on the
               same filehandle.  Record mode mixes with line mode only when the
               same buffering layer is in use for both modes.

               You cannot call "input_record_separator()" on a handle, only as a
               static method.  See IO::Handle.

               See also "Newlines" in perlport.  Also see "$.".

               Mnemonic: / delimits line boundaries when quoting poetry.

       IO::Handle->output_record_separator( EXPR )
       $OUTPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR
       $ORS
       $\      The output record separator for the print operator.  If defined,
               this value is printed after the last of print's arguments.
               Default is "undef".

               You cannot call "output_record_separator()" on a handle, only as
               a static method.  See IO::Handle.

               Mnemonic: you set "$\" instead of adding "\n" at the end of the
               print.  Also, it's just like $/, but it's what you get "back"
               from Perl.

       HANDLE->autoflush( EXPR )
       $OUTPUT_AUTOFLUSH
       $|      If set to nonzero, forces a flush right away and after every
               write or print on the currently selected output channel.  Default
               is 0 (regardless of whether the channel is really buffered by the
               system or not; $| tells you only whether you've asked Perl
               explicitly to flush after each write).  STDOUT will typically be
               line buffered if output is to the terminal and block buffered
               otherwise.  Setting this variable is useful primarily when you
               are outputting to a pipe or socket, such as when you are running
               a Perl program under rsh and want to see the output as it's
               happening.  This has no effect on input buffering.  See "getc" in
               perlfunc for that.  See "select" in perlfunc on how to select the
               output channel.  See also IO::Handle.

               Mnemonic: when you want your pipes to be piping hot.

       ${^LAST_FH}
               This read-only variable contains a reference to the last-read
               filehandle.  This is set by "<HANDLE>", "readline", "tell", "eof"
               and "seek".  This is the same handle that $. and "tell" and "eof"
               without arguments use.  It is also the handle used when Perl
               appends ", <STDIN> line 1" to an error or warning message.

               This variable was added in Perl v5.18.0.

       Variables related to formats

       The special variables for formats are a subset of those for filehandles.
       See perlform for more information about Perl's formats.

       $ACCUMULATOR
       $^A     The current value of the "write()" accumulator for "format()"
               lines.  A format contains "formline()" calls that put their
               result into $^A.  After calling its format, "write()" prints out
               the contents of $^A and empties.  So you never really see the
               contents of $^A unless you call "formline()" yourself and then
               look at it.  See perlform and "formline PICTURE,LIST" in
               perlfunc.

       IO::Handle->format_formfeed(EXPR)
       $FORMAT_FORMFEED
       $^L     What formats output as a form feed.  The default is "\f".

               You cannot call "format_formfeed()" on a handle, only as a static
               method.  See IO::Handle.

       HANDLE->format_page_number(EXPR)
       $FORMAT_PAGE_NUMBER
       $%      The current page number of the currently selected output channel.

               Mnemonic: "%" is page number in nroff.

       HANDLE->format_lines_left(EXPR)
       $FORMAT_LINES_LEFT
       $-      The number of lines left on the page of the currently selected
               output channel.

               Mnemonic: lines_on_page - lines_printed.

       IO::Handle->format_line_break_characters EXPR
       $FORMAT_LINE_BREAK_CHARACTERS
       $:      The current set of characters after which a string may be broken
               to fill continuation fields (starting with "^") in a format.  The
               default is " \n-", to break on a space, newline, or a hyphen.

               You cannot call "format_line_break_characters()" on a handle,
               only as a static method.  See IO::Handle.

               Mnemonic: a "colon" in poetry is a part of a line.

       HANDLE->format_lines_per_page(EXPR)
       $FORMAT_LINES_PER_PAGE
       $=      The current page length (printable lines) of the currently
               selected output channel.  The default is 60.

               Mnemonic: = has horizontal lines.

       HANDLE->format_top_name(EXPR)
       $FORMAT_TOP_NAME
       $^      The name of the current top-of-page format for the currently
               selected output channel.  The default is the name of the
               filehandle with "_TOP" appended.  For example, the default format
               top name for the "STDOUT" filehandle is "STDOUT_TOP".

               Mnemonic: points to top of page.

       HANDLE->format_name(EXPR)
       $FORMAT_NAME
       $~      The name of the current report format for the currently selected
               output channel.  The default format name is the same as the
               filehandle name.  For example, the default format name for the
               "STDOUT" filehandle is just "STDOUT".

               Mnemonic: brother to $^.

   Error Variables
       The variables $@, $!, $^E, and $? contain information about different
       types of error conditions that may appear during execution of a Perl
       program.  The variables are shown ordered by the "distance" between the
       subsystem which reported the error and the Perl process.  They correspond
       to errors detected by the Perl interpreter, C library, operating system,
       or an external program, respectively.

       To illustrate the differences between these variables, consider the
       following Perl expression, which uses a single-quoted string.  After
       execution of this statement, perl may have set all four special error
       variables:

           eval q{
               open my $pipe, "/cdrom/install |" or die $!;
               my @res = <$pipe>;
               close $pipe or die "bad pipe: $?, $!";
           };

       When perl executes the "eval()" expression, it translates the "open()",
       "<PIPE>", and "close" calls in the C run-time library and thence to the
       operating system kernel.  perl sets $! to the C library's "errno" if one
       of these calls fails.

       $@ is set if the string to be "eval"-ed did not compile (this may happen
       if "open" or "close" were imported with bad prototypes), or if Perl code
       executed during evaluation "die()"d.  In these cases the value of $@ is
       the compile error, or the argument to "die" (which will interpolate $!
       and $?).  (See also Fatal, though.)

       Under a few operating systems, $^E may contain a more verbose error
       indicator, such as in this case, "CDROM tray not closed."  Systems that
       do not support extended error messages leave $^E the same as $!.

       Finally, $? may be set to non-0 value if the external program
       /cdrom/install fails.  The upper eight bits reflect specific error
       conditions encountered by the program (the program's "exit()" value).
       The lower eight bits reflect mode of failure, like signal death and core
       dump information.  See wait(2) for details.  In contrast to $! and $^E,
       which are set only if error condition is detected, the variable $? is set
       on each "wait" or pipe "close", overwriting the old value.  This is more
       like $@, which on every "eval()" is always set on failure and cleared on
       success.

       For more details, see the individual descriptions at $@, $!, $^E, and $?.

       ${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}
               The native status returned by the last pipe close, backtick
               ("``") command, successful call to "wait()" or "waitpid()", or
               from the "system()" operator.  On POSIX-like systems this value
               can be decoded with the WIFEXITED, WEXITSTATUS, WIFSIGNALED,
               WTERMSIG, WIFSTOPPED, WSTOPSIG and WIFCONTINUED functions
               provided by the POSIX module.

               Under VMS this reflects the actual VMS exit status; i.e. it is
               the same as $? when the pragma "use vmsish 'status'" is in
               effect.

               This variable was added in Perl v5.10.0.

       $EXTENDED_OS_ERROR
       $^E     Error information specific to the current operating system.  At
               the moment, this differs from $! under only VMS, OS/2, and Win32
               (and for MacPerl).  On all other platforms, $^E is always just
               the same as $!.

               Under VMS, $^E provides the VMS status value from the last system
               error.  This is more specific information about the last system
               error than that provided by $!.  This is particularly important
               when $! is set to EVMSERR.

               Under OS/2, $^E is set to the error code of the last call to OS/2
               API either via CRT, or directly from perl.

               Under Win32, $^E always returns the last error information
               reported by the Win32 call "GetLastError()" which describes the
               last error from within the Win32 API.  Most Win32-specific code
               will report errors via $^E.  ANSI C and Unix-like calls set
               "errno" and so most portable Perl code will report errors via $!.

               Caveats mentioned in the description of $! generally apply to
               $^E, also.

               This variable was added in Perl 5.003.

               Mnemonic: Extra error explanation.

       $EXCEPTIONS_BEING_CAUGHT
       $^S     Current state of the interpreter.

                       $^S         State
                       ---------   -------------------------------------
                       undef       Parsing module, eval, or main program
                       true (1)    Executing an eval
                       false (0)   Otherwise

               The first state may happen in $SIG{__DIE__} and $SIG{__WARN__}
               handlers.

               The English name $EXCEPTIONS_BEING_CAUGHT is slightly misleading,
               because the "undef" value does not indicate whether exceptions
               are being caught, since compilation of the main program does not
               catch exceptions.

               This variable was added in Perl 5.004.

       $WARNING
       $^W     The current value of the warning switch, initially true if -w was
               used, false otherwise, but directly modifiable.

               See also warnings.

               Mnemonic: related to the -w switch.

       ${^WARNING_BITS}
               The current set of warning checks enabled by the "use warnings"
               pragma.  It has the same scoping as the $^H and "%^H" variables.
               The exact values are considered internal to the warnings pragma
               and may change between versions of Perl.

               This variable was added in Perl v5.6.0.

       $OS_ERROR
       $ERRNO
       $!      When referenced, $! retrieves the current value of the C "errno"
               integer variable.  If $! is assigned a numerical value, that
               value is stored in "errno".  When referenced as a string, $!
               yields the system error string corresponding to "errno".

               Many system or library calls set "errno" if they fail, to
               indicate the cause of failure.  They usually do not set "errno"
               to zero if they succeed.  This means "errno", hence $!, is
               meaningful only immediately after a failure:

                   if (open my $fh, "<", $filename) {
                               # Here $! is meaningless.
                               ...
                   }
                   else {
                               # ONLY here is $! meaningful.
                               ...
                               # Already here $! might be meaningless.
                   }
                   # Since here we might have either success or failure,
                   # $! is meaningless.

               Here, meaningless means that $! may be unrelated to the outcome
               of the "open()" operator.  Assignment to $! is similarly
               ephemeral.  It can be used immediately before invoking the
               "die()" operator, to set the exit value, or to inspect the system
               error string corresponding to error n, or to restore $! to a
               meaningful state.

               Mnemonic: What just went bang?

       %OS_ERROR
       %ERRNO
       %!      Each element of "%!" has a true value only if $! is set to that
               value.  For example, $!{ENOENT} is true if and only if the
               current value of $! is "ENOENT"; that is, if the most recent
               error was "No such file or directory" (or its moral equivalent:
               not all operating systems give that exact error, and certainly
               not all languages).  To check if a particular key is meaningful
               on your system, use "exists $!{the_key}"; for a list of legal
               keys, use "keys %!".  See Errno for more information, and also
               see "$!".

               This variable was added in Perl 5.005.

       $CHILD_ERROR
       $?      The status returned by the last pipe close, backtick ("``")
               command, successful call to "wait()" or "waitpid()", or from the
               "system()" operator.  This is just the 16-bit status word
               returned by the traditional Unix "wait()" system call (or else is
               made up to look like it).  Thus, the exit value of the subprocess
               is really ("$? >> 8"), and "$? & 127" gives which signal, if any,
               the process died from, and "$? & 128" reports whether there was a
               core dump.

               Additionally, if the "h_errno" variable is supported in C, its
               value is returned via $? if any "gethost*()" function fails.

               If you have installed a signal handler for "SIGCHLD", the value
               of $? will usually be wrong outside that handler.

               Inside an "END" subroutine $? contains the value that is going to
               be given to "exit()".  You can modify $? in an "END" subroutine
               to change the exit status of your program.  For example:

                   END {
                       $? = 1 if $? == 255;  # die would make it 255
                   }

               Under VMS, the pragma "use vmsish 'status'" makes $? reflect the
               actual VMS exit status, instead of the default emulation of POSIX
               status; see "$?" in perlvms for details.

               Mnemonic: similar to sh and ksh.

       $EVAL_ERROR
       $@      The Perl syntax error message from the last "eval()" operator.
               If $@ is the null string, the last "eval()" parsed and executed
               correctly (although the operations you invoked may have failed in
               the normal fashion).

               Warning messages are not collected in this variable.  You can,
               however, set up a routine to process warnings by setting
               $SIG{__WARN__} as described in "%SIG".

               Mnemonic: Where was the syntax error "at"?

   Variables related to the interpreter state
       These variables provide information about the current interpreter state.

       $COMPILING
       $^C     The current value of the flag associated with the -c switch.
               Mainly of use with -MO=... to allow code to alter its behavior
               when being compiled, such as for example to "AUTOLOAD" at compile
               time rather than normal, deferred loading.  Setting "$^C = 1" is
               similar to calling "B::minus_c".

               This variable was added in Perl v5.6.0.

       $DEBUGGING
       $^D     The current value of the debugging flags.  May be read or set.
               Like its command-line equivalent, you can use numeric or symbolic
               values, eg "$^D = 10" or "$^D = "st"".

               Mnemonic: value of -D switch.

       ${^ENCODING}
               The object reference to the "Encode" object that is used to
               convert the source code to Unicode.  Thanks to this variable your
               Perl script does not have to be written in UTF-8.  Default is
               undef.  The direct manipulation of this variable is highly
               discouraged.

               This variable was added in Perl 5.8.2.

       ${^GLOBAL_PHASE}
               The current phase of the perl interpreter.

               Possible values are:

               CONSTRUCT
                       The "PerlInterpreter*" is being constructed via
                       "perl_construct".  This value is mostly there for
                       completeness and for use via the underlying C variable
                       "PL_phase".  It's not really possible for Perl code to be
                       executed unless construction of the interpreter is
                       finished.

               START   This is the global compile-time.  That includes,
                       basically, every "BEGIN" block executed directly or
                       indirectly from during the compile-time of the top-level
                       program.

                       This phase is not called "BEGIN" to avoid confusion with
                       "BEGIN"-blocks, as those are executed during compile-time
                       of any compilation unit, not just the top-level program.
                       A new, localised compile-time entered at run-time, for
                       example by constructs as "eval "use SomeModule"" are not
                       global interpreter phases, and therefore aren't reflected
                       by "${^GLOBAL_PHASE}".

               CHECK   Execution of any "CHECK" blocks.

               INIT    Similar to "CHECK", but for "INIT"-blocks, not "CHECK"
                       blocks.

               RUN     The main run-time, i.e. the execution of "PL_main_root".

               END     Execution of any "END" blocks.

               DESTRUCT
                       Global destruction.

               Also note that there's no value for UNITCHECK-blocks.  That's
               because those are run for each compilation unit individually, and
               therefore is not a global interpreter phase.

               Not every program has to go through each of the possible phases,
               but transition from one phase to another can only happen in the
               order described in the above list.

               An example of all of the phases Perl code can see:

                   BEGIN { print "compile-time: ${^GLOBAL_PHASE}\n" }

                   INIT  { print "init-time: ${^GLOBAL_PHASE}\n" }

                   CHECK { print "check-time: ${^GLOBAL_PHASE}\n" }

                   {
                       package Print::Phase;

                       sub new {
                           my ($class, $time) = @_;
                           return bless \$time, $class;

               This variable was added in Perl 5.14.0.

       $^H     WARNING: This variable is strictly for internal use only.  Its
               availability, behavior, and contents are subject to change
               without notice.

               This variable contains compile-time hints for the Perl
               interpreter.  At the end of compilation of a BLOCK the value of
               this variable is restored to the value when the interpreter
               started to compile the BLOCK.

               When perl begins to parse any block construct that provides a
               lexical scope (e.g., eval body, required file, subroutine body,
               loop body, or conditional block), the existing value of $^H is
               saved, but its value is left unchanged.  When the compilation of
               the block is completed, it regains the saved value.  Between the
               points where its value is saved and restored, code that executes
               within BEGIN blocks is free to change the value of $^H.

               This behavior provides the semantic of lexical scoping, and is
               used in, for instance, the "use strict" pragma.

               The contents should be an integer; different bits of it are used
               for different pragmatic flags.  Here's an example:

                   sub add_100 { $^H |= 0x100 }

                   sub foo {
                       BEGIN { add_100() }
                       bar->baz($boon);
                   }

               Consider what happens during execution of the BEGIN block.  At
               this point the BEGIN block has already been compiled, but the
               body of "foo()" is still being compiled.  The new value of $^H
               will therefore be visible only while the body of "foo()" is being
               compiled.

               Substitution of "BEGIN { add_100() }" block with:

                   BEGIN { require strict; strict->import('vars') }

               demonstrates how "use strict 'vars'" is implemented.  Here's a
               conditional version of the same lexical pragma:

                   BEGIN {
                       require strict; strict->import('vars') if $condition
                   }

               This variable was added in Perl 5.003.

       %^H     The "%^H" hash provides the same scoping semantic as $^H.  This
               makes it useful for implementation of lexically scoped pragmas.
               See perlpragma.

               When putting items into "%^H", in order to avoid conflicting with
               other users of the hash there is a convention regarding which
               keys to use.  A module should use only keys that begin with the
               module's name (the name of its main package) and a "/" character.
               For example, a module "Foo::Bar" should use keys such as
               "Foo::Bar/baz".

               This variable was added in Perl v5.6.0.

       ${^OPEN}
               An internal variable used by PerlIO.  A string in two parts,
               separated by a "\0" byte, the first part describes the input
               layers, the second part describes the output layers.

               This variable was added in Perl v5.8.0.

       $PERLDB
       $^P     The internal variable for debugging support.  The meanings of the
               various bits are subject to change, but currently indicate:

               0x01  Debug subroutine enter/exit.

               0x02  Line-by-line debugging.  Causes "DB::DB()" subroutine to be
                     called for each statement executed.  Also causes saving
                     source code lines (like 0x400).

               0x04  Switch off optimizations.

               0x08  Preserve more data for future interactive inspections.

               0x10  Keep info about source lines on which a subroutine is
                     defined.

               0x20  Start with single-step on.

               0x40  Use subroutine address instead of name when reporting.

               0x80  Report "goto &subroutine" as well.

               0x100 Provide informative "file" names for evals based on the
                     place they were compiled.

               0x200 Provide informative names to anonymous subroutines based on
                     the place they were compiled.

               0x400 Save source code lines into "@{"_<$filename"}".

               Some bits may be relevant at compile-time only, some at run-time
               only.  This is a new mechanism and the details may change.  See
               also perldebguts.

       ${^TAINT}
               Reflects if taint mode is on or off.  1 for on (the program was
               run with -T), 0 for off, -1 when only taint warnings are enabled
               (i.e. with -t or -TU).

               This variable is read-only.

               This variable was added in Perl v5.8.0.

       ${^UNICODE}
               Reflects certain Unicode settings of Perl.  See perlrun
               documentation for the "-C" switch for more information about the
               possible values.

               This variable is set during Perl startup and is thereafter read-
               only.

               This variable was added in Perl v5.8.2.

       ${^UTF8CACHE}
               This variable controls the state of the internal UTF-8 offset
               caching code.  1 for on (the default), 0 for off, -1 to debug the
               caching code by checking all its results against linear scans,
               and panicking on any discrepancy.

               This variable was added in Perl v5.8.9.  It is subject to change
               or removal without notice, but is currently used to avoid
               recalculating the boundaries of multi-byte UTF-8-encoded
               characters.

       ${^UTF8LOCALE}
               This variable indicates whether a UTF-8 locale was detected by
               perl at startup.  This information is used by perl when it's in
               adjust-utf8ness-to-locale mode (as when run with the "-CL"
               command-line switch); see perlrun for more info on this.

               This variable was added in Perl v5.8.8.

   Deprecated and removed variables
       Deprecating a variable announces the intent of the perl maintainers to
       eventually remove the variable from the language.  It may still be
       available despite its status.  Using a deprecated variable triggers a
       warning.

       Once a variable is removed, its use triggers an error telling you the
       variable is unsupported.

       See perldiag for details about error messages.

       $OFMT
       $#      $# was a variable that could be used to format printed numbers.
               After a deprecation cycle, its magic was removed in Perl v5.10.0
               and using it now triggers a warning: "$# is no longer supported".

               This is not the sigil you use in front of an array name to get
               the last index, like $#array.  That's still how you get the last
               index of an array in Perl.  The two have nothing to do with each
               other.

               Deprecated in Perl 5.

               Removed in Perl v5.10.0.

       $*      $* was a variable that you could use to enable multiline
               matching.  After a deprecation cycle, its magic was removed in
               Perl v5.10.0.  Using it now triggers a warning: "$* is no longer
               supported".  You should use the "/s" and "/m" regexp modifiers
               instead.

               Deprecated in Perl 5.

               Removed in Perl v5.10.0.

       $ARRAY_BASE
       $[      This variable stores the index of the first element in an array,
               and of the first character in a substring.  The default is 0, but
               you could theoretically set it to 1 to make Perl behave more like
               awk (or Fortran) when subscripting and when evaluating the
               index() and substr() functions.

               As of release 5 of Perl, assignment to $[ is treated as a
               compiler directive, and cannot influence the behavior of any
               other file.  (That's why you can only assign compile-time
               constants to it.)  Its use is highly discouraged.

               Prior to Perl v5.10.0, assignment to $[ could be seen from outer
               lexical scopes in the same file, unlike other compile-time
               directives (such as strict).  Using local() on it would bind its
               value strictly to a lexical block.  Now it is always lexically
               scoped.

               As of Perl v5.16.0, it is implemented by the arybase module.  See
               arybase for more details on its behaviour.

               Under "use v5.16", or "no feature "array_base"", $[ no longer has
               any effect, and always contains 0.  Assigning 0 to it is
               permitted, but any other value will produce an error.

               Mnemonic: [ begins subscripts.

               Deprecated in Perl v5.12.0.

       $OLD_PERL_VERSION
       $]      See "$^V" for a more modern representation of the Perl version
               that allows accurate string comparisons.

               The version + patchlevel / 1000 of the Perl interpreter.  This
               variable can be used to determine whether the Perl interpreter
               executing a script is in the right range of versions:

                   warn "No checksumming!\n" if $] < 3.019;

               The floating point representation can sometimes lead to
               inaccurate numeric comparisons.

               See also the documentation of "use VERSION" and "require VERSION"
               for a convenient way to fail if the running Perl interpreter is
               too old.

               Mnemonic: Is this version of perl in the right bracket?
