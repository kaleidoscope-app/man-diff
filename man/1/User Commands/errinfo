NAME
       errinfo - print errno for syscall fails. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       errinfo [-a|-A|-hsvZ] [-c command]

DESCRIPTION
       errinfo snoops syscall failures and prints the errno value and
       description of the error number.

       This program can help determine if applications are silently failing,
       providing some details on the cause.

       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

       -c     counts - print an aggregate style report containing a frequency
              count of errors

       -n name
              examine processes with ths name only (eg, "ls")

EXAMPLES
       Default output, print errors as they occur,
              # errinfo

       Print a frequency count report,
              # errinfo -c

       Snoop errors as they occur for "ssh" processes,
              # errinfo -n ssh PP

       Snoop errors for PID 81 only,
              # errinfo -p 81
