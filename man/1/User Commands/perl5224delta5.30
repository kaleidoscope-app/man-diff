NAME
       perl5224delta - what is new for perl v5.22.4

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes differences between the 5.22.3 release and the
       5.22.4 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.22.2, first read
       perl5223delta, which describes differences between 5.22.2 and 5.22.3.

Security
   Improved handling of '.' in @INC in base.pm
       The handling of (the removal of) '.' in @INC in base has been improved.
       This resolves some problematic behaviour in the approach taken in Perl
       5.22.3, which is probably best described in the following two threads on
       the Perl 5 Porters mailing list:
       <http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2016/08/msg238991.html>,
       <http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2016/10/msg240297.html>.

   "Escaped" colons and relative paths in PATH
       On Unix systems, Perl treats any relative paths in the PATH environment
       variable as tainted when starting a new process.  Previously, it was
       allowing a backslash to escape a colon (unlike the OS), consequently
       allowing relative paths to be considered safe if the PATH was set to
       something like "/\:.".  The check has been fixed to treat "." as tainted
       in that example.

Acknowledgements
       Perl 5.22.4 represents approximately 6 months of development since Perl
       5.22.3 and contains approximately 2,200 lines of changes across 52 files
       from 16 authors.

       Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there
       were approximately 970 lines of changes to 18 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant
       community of users and developers.  The following people are known to
       have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.22.4:

       Aaron Crane, Abigail, Aristotle Pagaltzis, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, David
       Mitchell, Eric Herman, Father Chrysostomos, James E Keenan, Karl
       Williamson, Lukas Mai, Renee Baecker, Ricardo Signes, Sawyer X, Stevan
       Little, Steve Hay, Tony Cook.

       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
       generated from version control history.  In particular, it does not
       include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
       modules included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN
       community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please
       see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.

Reporting Bugs
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
       recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
       database at https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
       http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
       included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
       sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of "perl
       -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
       porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
       send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed
       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
       committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure
       out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate
       or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported.
       Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl core, not
       for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
