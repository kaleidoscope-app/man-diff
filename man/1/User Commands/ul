UL(1)                        General Commands Manual                       UL(1)

NAME
     ul â€“ do underlining

SYNOPSIS
     ul [-i] [-t terminal] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The ul utility reads the named files (or standard input if none are given)
     and translates occurrences of underscores to the sequence which indicates
     underlining for the terminal in use, as specified by the environment
     variable TERM.  The file /etc/termcap is read to determine the appropriate
     sequences for underlining.  If the terminal is incapable of underlining,
     but is capable of a standout mode then that is used instead.  If the
     terminal can overstrike, or handles underlining automatically, ul
     degenerates to cat(1).  If the terminal cannot underline, underlining is
     ignored.

     The following options are available:

     -i      Underlining is indicated by a separate line containing appropriate
             dashes `-'; this is useful when you want to look at the underlining
             which is present in an nroff(1) output stream on a crt-terminal.

     -t terminal
             Overrides the terminal type specified in the environment with
             terminal.

ENVIRONMENT
     The LANG, LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE and TERM environment variables affect the
     execution of ul as described in environ(7).

EXIT STATUS
     The ul utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

SEE ALSO
     colcrt(1), man(1), nroff(1)

HISTORY
     The ul command appeared in 3.0BSD.

BUGS
     The nroff(1) command usually outputs a series of backspaces and underlines
     intermixed with the text to indicate underlining.  No attempt is made to
     optimize the backward motion.
