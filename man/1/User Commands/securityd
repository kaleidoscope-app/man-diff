NAME
     securityd â€“ Security context daemon for keychain and cryptographic
     operations

SYNOPSIS
     securityd

DESCRIPTION
     securityd maintains security contexts and arbitrates cryptographic
     operations.  Access to keychain items is routed through securityd to
     enforce access controls and to keep private keys out of user process
     address space.  All user interaction with securityd is mediated through the
     Security Agent.

     This command is not intended to be invoked directly.

HISTORY
     securityd was first introduced in Mac OS X version 10.0 (Cheetah) as the
     "Security Server" and was renamed in 10.4 (Tiger).
