CRYPTEXCTL-UNINSTALL(1)      General Commands Manual     CRYPTEXCTL-UNINSTALL(1)

NAME
     cryptexctl uninstall â€“ uninstall a cryptex

SYNOPSIS
     cryptexctl uninstall uninstall [-i | --immediate] CRYPTEX-IDENTIFIER

DESCRIPTION
     Uninstall the cryptex identified by CRYPTEX-IDENTIFIER.  A list of
     installed cryptexes and their identifiers can be retrieved via
     cryptexctl-list(1).

     When a cryptex is uninstalled cryptexd(8) will attempt to dispose of any
     services that were loaded from the cryptex and unmount the disk image.
     Complete uninstallation requires a reboot to ensure all processes are
     killed and all files are no longer in use before cryptexd(8) can safely
     finish the uninstallation.

OPTIONS
     -i | --immediate
              Force physical uninstalltion to happen immediately if possible.
              Normally uninstallation does not take full effect until the next
              reboot. This option will attempt to dispose of services loaded
              from the cryptex and unmount the disk image. Note that even if the
              disk image is unmounted successfully, there is no guarantee that
              all services from the cryptex have been disposed of. Exercise
              caution with this option.

     CRYPTEX-IDENTIFIER
              The identifier of the cryptex to uninstall. This is the same
              identifier used by cryptexctl-install(1) to install the cryptex
              and listed by cryptexctl-list(1).
