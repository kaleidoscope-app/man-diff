BSPATCH(1)                   General Commands Manual                  BSPATCH(1)

NAME
     bspatch – apply a patch built with bsdiff(1)

SYNOPSIS
     bspatch ⟨oldfile⟩ ⟨newfile⟩ ⟨patchfile⟩

DESCRIPTION
     bspatch generates ⟨newfile⟩ from ⟨oldfile⟩ and ⟨patchfile⟩ where
     ⟨patchfile⟩ is a binary patch built by bsdiff(1).

     bspatch uses memory equal to the size of ⟨oldfile⟩ plus the size of
     ⟨newfile⟩, but can tolerate a very small working set without a dramatic
     loss of performance.
