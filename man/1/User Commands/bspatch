BSPATCH(1)                   General Commands Manual                  BSPATCH(1)

NAME
     bspatch â€“ apply a patch built with bsdiff(1)

SYNOPSIS
     bspatch oldfile newfile patchfile

DESCRIPTION
     The bspatch utility generates newfile from oldfile and patchfile where
     patchfile is a binary patch built by bsdiff(1).

     The bspatch utility uses memory equal to the size of oldfile plus the size
     of newfile, but can tolerate a very small working set without a dramatic
     loss of performance.

SEE ALSO
     bsdiff(1)

BUGS
     The bspatch utility does not verify that oldfile is the correct source file
     for patchfile.  Attempting to apply a patch to the wrong file will usually
     produce garbage; consequently it is strongly recommended that users of
     bspatch verify that oldfile matches the source file from which patchfile
     was built, by comparing cryptographic hashes, for example.  Users may also
     wish to verify after running bspatch that newfile matches the target file
     from which was built.
