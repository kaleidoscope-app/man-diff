pstopdf(1)                   General Commands Manual                  pstopdf(1)

NAME
     pstopdf â€“ convert PostScript input into a PDF document.

SYNOPSIS
     pstopdf [inputfile] [-o outname] [-l] [-p]

DESCRIPTION
     pstopdf is a tool to convert PostScript input data into a PDF document. The
     input data may come from a file or may be read from stdin. The PDF document
     is always written to a file. The name of the output PDF file is derived
     from the name of the input file or may be explicitly named using the -o
     option.

     Flags:

     -o outname
             The name of the output file to create. If an explicit file name is
             not supplied, the output file will be created in the current
             directory and named foo.pdf for an input file named foo.ps

     -l      Specifies that any messages generated during file conversion be
             written to a log file. For an output file named foo.pdf the
             generated log file is foo.pdf.log rather than generated to stdout.
             If there are no messages, the log file is not generated.

     -p      Generates a simple progress message to stdout at the end of each
             page. Because conversion of complex or lengthy PostScript input can
             take time, it is sometimes useful to see that progress is being
             made. Progress messages are always written to stdout even when the
             -l (log file) option is specified.

EXAMPLES
     pstopdf inputfile.ps       Creates a PDF file named inputfile.pdf from the
                                PostScript data in the input file inputfile.ps

     pstopdf -o outputfilename  Creates a PDF file named outputfilename from the
                                PostScript data read from stdin.
