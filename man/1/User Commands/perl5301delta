NAME
       perl5301delta - what is new for perl v5.30.1

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes differences between the 5.30.0 release and the
       5.30.1 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.29.0, first read
       perl5300delta, which describes differences between 5.29.0 and 5.30.0.

Incompatible Changes
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.30.1.  If any
       exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report.  See
       "Reporting Bugs" below.

Modules and Pragmata
   Updated Modules and Pragmata
       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 5.20190522 to
           5.20191110.

Documentation
   Changes to Existing Documentation
       We have attempted to update the documentation to reflect the changes
       listed in this document.  If you find any we have missed, send email to
       perlbug@perl.org <mailto:perlbug@perl.org>.

       Additionally, documentation has been updated to reference GitHub as the
       new canonical repository and to describe the new GitHub pull request
       workflow.

Configuration and Compilation
       •   The "ECHO" macro is now defined.  This is used in a "dtrace" rule
           that was originally changed for FreeBSD, and the FreeBSD make
           apparently predefines it.  The Solaris make does not predefine "ECHO"
           which broke this rule on Solaris.  [perl #17057]
           <https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/17057>

Testing
       Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and changes
       in this release.

Platform Support
   Platform-Specific Notes
       Win32
           The locale tests could crash on Win32 due to a Windows bug, and
           separately due to the CRT throwing an exception if the locale name
           wasn't validly encoded in the current code page.

           For the second we now decode the locale name ourselves, and always
           decode it as UTF-8.

           [perl #16922] <https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/16922>

Selected Bug Fixes
       •   Setting $) now properly sets supplementary group ids, if you have the
           necessary privileges.  [perl #17031]
           <https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/17031>

       •   "readline @foo" now evaluates @foo in scalar context.  Previously, it
           would be evaluated in list context, and since readline() pops only
           one argument from the stack, the stack could underflow, or be left
           with unexpected values on it.  [perl #16929]
           <https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/16929>

       •   sv_gets() now recovers better if the target SV is modified by a
           signal handler.  [perl #16960]
           <https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/16960>

       •   Matching a non-"SVf_UTF8" string against a regular expression
           containing Unicode literals could leak an SV on each match attempt.
           [perl #17140] <https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/17140>

       •   "sprintf("%.*a", -10000, $x)" would cause a buffer overflow due to
           mishandling of the negative precision value.  [perl #16942]
           <https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/16942>

       •   "scalar()" on a reference could cause an erroneous assertion failure
           during compilation.  [perl #16969]
           <https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/16969>

Acknowledgements
       Perl 5.30.1 represents approximately 6 months of development since Perl
       5.30.0 and contains approximately 4,700 lines of changes across 67 files
       from 14 authors.

       Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there
       were approximately 910 lines of changes to 20 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

       Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant
       community of users and developers.  The following people are known to
       have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.30.1:

       Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Dan Book, David Mitchell, Hugo van der Sanden,
       James E Keenan, Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Manuel Mausz, Max
       Maischein, Nicolas R., Sawyer X, Steve Hay, Tom Hukins, Tony Cook.

       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
       generated from version control history.  In particular, it does not
       include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
       modules included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN
       community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please
       see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.

Reporting Bugs
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug
       database at <https://rt.perl.org/>.  There may also be information at
       <http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
       included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
       sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of "perl
       -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
       porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
       "SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec for details of
       how to report the issue.

Give Thanks
       If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl
       5, you can do so by running the "perlthanks" program:

           perlthanks

       This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of
       thanks.
