DESCRIPTION
     Use odutil to look at internal state information for opendirectoryd, enable
     or disable logging, or change statistics settings.

     Available commands:

     show            Show various internal information. Subcommands:
                     cache   Outputs contents of the cache.  Note, this output
                             is not included in show all command.
                     sessions
                             List all open sessions
                     nodes   List all open nodes
                     modules
                             List all loaded modules
                     requests
                             List all active requests
                     statistics
                             Outputs statistics information.  Some statistics
                             are always enabled (membership). Additional
                             statistics can be enabled see 'set statistics on'.
                     nodenames
                             List all available node names
                     all     List all of the above information (excludes cache)

     show configuration nodename
                     Show configuration of a specific node, Subcommands:
                     module modulename
                             Specific module is requested, otherwise global
                             options
                     option option
                             Output a value of a specific option.

     reset           Reset various internal information. Subcommands:
                     cache   Resets all caches including membership and kernel
                             (does not affect DNS cache)
                     statistics
                             Resets any accumulated statistics.

     set log         Change the type of log messages saved to persistent
                     storage. The configuration stays active across reboots and
                     must be changed to a new type or 'default'.  The next type
                     of messages are automatically stored to memory-only buffers
                     for enhanced debugging.
                     default
                             Enables saving log messages based on default system
                             behavior.  Typically, saves basic messages to
                             persistent storage and info messages to memory-only
                             buffers.
                     info    Enables saving of info type messages to persistent
                             storage and debug messages to memory-only buffers.
                     debug   Enables saving all types of messages to persistent
                             storage.

     set configuration nodename
                     Sets either global or per-module options accordingly.
                     module modulename
                             If module is omitted, then global option is
                             assumed.
                     option option value1 ...
                             Set a specific option to one or more values as
                             appropriate.

     set statistics  Enables or disables extended statistics. Statistics include
                     per-process-name call statistics and per-API call and
                     latencies.  This setting is persistent across reboots and
                     should not normally be run as it is memory intensive.
                     on      Enables statistics tracking
                     off     Disables statistics tracking
