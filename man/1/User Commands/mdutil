NAME
     mdutil â€“ manage the metadata stores used by Spotlight

SYNOPSIS
     mdutil [-pEsav] [-i on | off] mountPoint ...

DESCRIPTION
     The mdutil command is useful for managing the metadata stores for mounted
     volumes.

     The following options are available:

     -i on | off
         Sets the indexing status for the provided volumes to on or off.  Note
         that indexing may be delayed due to low disk space or other conditions.

     -d  Disables Spotlight searches on the provided volume.

     -E  This flag will cause each local store for the volumes indicated to be
         erased.  The stores will be rebuilt if appropriate.

     -s  Display the indexing status of the listed volumes.

     -a  Apply command to all stores on all volumes.

     -t  Resolve files from file id with an optional volume path or device id.

     -p  Spotlight caches indexes of some network devices locally.  This option
         requests that a local caches be flushed to the appropriate network
         device.

     -V volume-path
         Apply command to all stores on the specified volume.

     -v  Print verbose information when available.

     -r plugins
         Ask the server to reimport files for UTIs claimed by the listed plugin.

     -L volume-path
         List the directory contents of the Spotlight index on the specified
         volume.

     -P volume-path
         Dump the VolumeConfig.plist for the specified volume.

     -X volume-path
         Remove the Spotlight index directory on the specified volume.  This
         does not disable indexing.  Spotlight will reevaluate volume when it is
         unmounted and remounted, the machine is rebooted, or an explicit index
         command such as 'mdutil -i' or 'mdutil -E' run for the volume.
