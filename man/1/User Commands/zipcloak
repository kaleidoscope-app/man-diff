DESCRIPTION
       zipcloak encrypts all unencrypted entries in the zipfile.  This is the
       default action.


       The -d option is used to decrypt encrypted entries in the zipfile.


       zipcloak uses original zip encryption which is considered weak.


       Note:  The encryption code of this program is not copyrighted and is put
              in the public domain.  It was originally written in Europe and can
              be freely distributed from any country including the U.S.A.
              (Previously if this program was imported into the U.S.A, it could
              not be re-exported from the U.S.A to another country.)  See the
              file README.CR included in the source distribution for more on
              this.  Otherwise, the Info-ZIP license applies.


EXAMPLES
       To be added.


BUGS
       Large files (> 2 GB) and large archives not yet supported.

       Split archives not yet supported.  A work around is to convert the split
       archive to a single-file archive using zip and then use zipcloak on the
       single-file archive.  If needed, the resulting archive can then be split
       again using zip.
