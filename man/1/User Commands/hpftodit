HPFTODIT(1)                  General Commands Manual                 HPFTODIT(1)



NAME
       hpftodit - create font description files for use with groff -Tlj4

SYNOPSIS
       hpftodit [ -adqsv ] [ -in ] tfm_file map_file font

       It is possible to have whitespace between the -i option and its
       parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       hpftodit creates a font file for use with a Hewlett-Packard LaserJet
       4–series (or newer) printer with groff -Tlj4, using data from an HP
       tagged font metric (TFM) file.  tfm_file is the name of the TFM file for
       the font; Intellifont and TrueType TFM files are supported, but symbol
       set TFM files are not.  map_file is a file giving the groff names for
       characters in the font; this file should consist of a sequence of lines
       of the form:

              m u c1 c2 ... [ # comment ]

       where m is a decimal integer giving the MSL number of the character, u is
       a hexadecimal integer giving the Unicode value of the character, and c1,
       c2, ...  are the groff names of the character.  The values can be
       separated by any whitespace; the Unicode value must use uppercase digits
       A–F, and must be without a leading `0x', `u', or `U+'.  Unicode values
       corresponding to composite glyphs are decomposed; e.g., `u00C0' becomes
       `u0041_0300'.  The name for a glyph without a groff name may be given as
       uXXXX if the glyph corresponds to a Unicode value, or as an unnamed glyph
       `---'.  If the given Unicode value is in the Private Use Area
       (0xE000–0xF8FF), the glyph is included as an unnamed glyph.  Refer to
       groff_diff(1) for additional information about unnamed glyphs and how to
       access them.

       Blank lines and lines beginning with `#' are ignored.  A `#' following
       one or more groff names begins a comment.  Because `#' is a valid groff
       name, it must appear first in a list of groff names if a comment is
       included, e.g.,

              3   0023   #   # number sign

       or

              3   0023   # sh   # number sign

       rather than

              3   0023   sh #   # number sign

       which will treat the first `#' as the beginning of the comment.

       font is the name of the groff font file.  The groff font file is written
       to font; if font is specified as `-', the output is written to the
       standard output.

       The -s option should be given if the font is special (a font is special
       if troff should search it whenever a character is not found in the
       current font).  If the font is special, it should be listed in the fonts
       command in the DESC file; if it is not special, there is no need to list
       it, since troff can automatically mount it when it's first used.

       If the -i option is used, hpftodit automatically will generate an italic
       correction, a left italic correction and a subscript correction for each
       character (the significance of these parameters is explained in
       groff_font(5)).

OPTIONS
       -a     Include characters in the TFM file that are not included in the
              map file.  A glyph with corresponding Unicode value is given the
              name uXXXX; a glyph without a Unicode value is included as an
              unnamed glyph `---'.  A glyph with a Unicode value in the Private
              Use Area (0xE000–0xF8FF) also is included as an unnamed glyph.

              This option provides a simple means of adding Unicode-named and
              unnamed glyphs to a font without including them in the map file,
              but it affords little control over which glyphs are placed in a
              regular font and which are placed in a special font.  The presence
              or absence of the -s option has some effect on which glyphs are
              included: without the -s option, only the “text” symbol sets are
              searched for matching glyphs; with the -s option, only the
              “mathematical” symbol sets are searched.  Nonetheless, restricting
              the symbol sets searched isn't very selective—many glyphs are
              placed in both regular and special fonts.  Normally, the -a option
              should be used only as a last resort.

       -d     Dump information about the TFM file to the standard output; this
              option can be useful for ensuring that a TFM file is a proper
              match for a font, and that the contents of the TFM file are
              suitable.  The information includes the values of important TFM
              tags, and a listing (by MSL number for Intellifont TFM files or by
              Unicode value for TrueType TFM files) of the glyphs included in
              the TFM file.  The unit of measure `DU' for some tags indicates
              design units; there are 8782 design units per em for Intellifont
              fonts, and 2048 design units per em for TrueType fonts.  Note that
              the accessibility of a glyph depends on its inclusion in a symbol
              set; some TFM files list many glyphs but only a few symbol sets.

              The glyph listing includes the glyph index within the TFM file,
              the MSL or Unicode value, and the symbol set and character code
              that will be used to print the glyph.  If map_file is given, groff
              names are given for matching glyphs.  If only the glyph index and
              MSL or Unicode value are given, the glyph does not appear in any
              supported symbol set and cannot be printed.

              With the -d option, map_file is optional, and font is ignored if
              given.

       -q     Suppress warnings about characters in the map file that were not
              found in the TFM file.  Warnings never are given for unnamed
              glyphs or by glyphs named by their Unicode values.  This option is
              useful when sending the output of hpftodit to the standard output.

       -v     Print the hpftodit version number.

       -s     The font is special.  This option adds the special command to the
              font file, and affects the order in which HP symbol sets are
              searched for each glyph.  Without the -s option, the “text” sets
              are searched before the “mathematical” symbol sets.  With the -s
              option, the search order is reversed.

       -in    Generate an italic correction for each character so that the
              character's width plus the character's italic correction is equal
              to n thousandths of an em plus the amount by which the right edge
              of the character's bounding is to the right of the character's
              origin.  If this would result in a negative italic correction, use
              a zero italic correction instead.

              Also generate a subscript correction equal to the product of the
              tangent of the slant of the font and four fifths of the x-height
              of the font.  If this would result in a subscript correction
              greater than the italic correction, use a subscript correction
              equal to the italic correction instead.

              Also generate a left italic correction for each character equal to
              n thousandths of an em plus the amount by which the left edge of
              the character's bounding box is to the left of the character's
              origin.  The left italic correction may be negative.

              This option normally is needed only with italic or oblique fonts;
              a value of 50 (0.05 em) usually is a reasonable choice.
