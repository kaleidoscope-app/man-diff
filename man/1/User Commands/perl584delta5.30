NAME
       perl584delta - what is new for perl v5.8.4

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes differences between the 5.8.3 release and the
       5.8.4 release.

Incompatible Changes
       Many minor bugs have been fixed. Scripts which happen to rely on
       previously erroneous behaviour will consider these fixes as incompatible
       changes :-) You are advised to perform sufficient acceptance testing on
       this release to satisfy yourself that this does not affect you, before
       putting this release into production.

       The diagnostic output of Carp has been changed slightly, to add a space
       after the comma between arguments. This makes it much easier for tools
       such as web browsers to wrap it, but might confuse any automatic tools
       which perform detailed parsing of Carp output.

       The internal dump output has been improved, so that non-printable
       characters such as newline and backspace are output in "\x" notation,
       rather than octal. This might just confuse non-robust tools which parse
       the output of modules such as Devel::Peek.

Core Enhancements
   Malloc wrapping
       Perl can now be built to detect attempts to assign pathologically large
       chunks of memory.  Previously such assignments would suffer from integer
       wrap-around during size calculations causing a misallocation, which would
       crash perl, and could theoretically be used for "stack smashing" attacks.
       The wrapping defaults to enabled on platforms where we know it works
       (most AIX configurations, BSDi, Darwin, DEC OSF/1, FreeBSD, HP/UX, GNU
       Linux, OpenBSD, Solaris, VMS and most Win32 compilers) and defaults to
       disabled on other platforms.

   Unicode Character Database 4.0.1
       The copy of the Unicode Character Database included in Perl 5.8 has been
       updated to 4.0.1 from 4.0.0.

   suidperl less insecure
       Paul Szabo has analysed and patched "suidperl" to remove existing known
       insecurities. Currently there are no known holes in "suidperl", but
       previous experience shows that we cannot be confident that these were the
       last. You may no longer invoke the set uid perl directly, so to preserve
       backwards compatibility with scripts that invoke #!/usr/bin/suidperl the
       only set uid binary is now "sperl5.8."n ("sperl5.8.4" for this release).
       "suidperl" is installed as a hard link to "perl"; both "suidperl" and
       "perl" will invoke "sperl5.8.4" automatically the set uid binary, so this
       change should be completely transparent.

       For new projects the core perl team would strongly recommend that you use
       dedicated, single purpose security tools such as "sudo" in preference to
       "suidperl".

   format
       In addition to bug fixes, "format"'s features have been enhanced. See
       perlform

Modules and Pragmata
       The (mis)use of "/tmp" in core modules and documentation has been tidied
       up.  Some modules available both within the perl core and independently
       from CPAN ("dual-life modules") have not yet had these changes applied;
       the changes will be integrated into future stable perl releases as the
       modules are updated on CPAN.

       utf8

Performance Enhancements
       •   Accelerated Unicode case mappings ("/i", "lc", "uc", etc).

       •   In place sort optimised (eg "@a = sort @a")

       •   Unnecessary assignment optimised away in

             my $s = undef;
             my @a = ();
             my %h = ();

       •   Optimised "map" in scalar context

Utility Changes
       The Perl debugger (lib/perl5db.pl) can now save all debugger commands for
       sourcing later, and can display the parent inheritance tree of a given
       class.

Installation and Configuration Improvements
       The build process on both VMS and Windows has had several minor
       improvements made. On Windows Borland's C compiler can now compile perl
       with PerlIO and/or USE_LARGE_FILES enabled.

       "perl.exe" on Windows now has a "Camel" logo icon. The use of a camel
       with the topic of Perl is a trademark of O'Reilly and Associates Inc.,
       and is used with their permission (ie distribution of the source,
       compiling a Windows executable from it, and using that executable
       locally). Use of the supplied camel for anything other than a perl
       executable's icon is specifically not covered, and anyone wishing to
       redistribute perl binaries with the icon should check directly with
       O'Reilly beforehand.

       Perl should build cleanly on Stratus VOS once more.

Selected Bug Fixes
       More utf8 bugs fixed, notably in how "chomp", "chop", "send", and
       "syswrite" and interact with utf8 data. Concatenation now works correctly
       when "use bytes;" is in scope.

       Pragmata are now correctly propagated into (?{...}) constructions in
       regexps.  Code such as

          my $x = qr{ ... (??{ $x }) ... };

       will now (correctly) fail under use strict. (As the inner $x is and has
       always referred to $::x)

       The "const in void context" warning has been suppressed for a constant in
       an optimised-away boolean expression such as "5 || print;"

       "perl -i" could "fchmod(stdin)" by mistake. This is serious if stdin is
       attached to a terminal, and perl is running as root. Now fixed.

New or Changed Diagnostics
       "Carp" and the internal diagnostic routines used by "Devel::Peek" have
       been made clearer, as described in "Incompatible Changes"

Changed Internals
       Some bugs have been fixed in the hash internals. Restricted hashes and
       their place holders are now allocated and deleted at slightly different
       times, but this should not be visible to user code.

Future Directions
       Code freeze for the next maintenance release (5.8.5) will be on 30th June
       2004, with release by mid July.

Platform Specific Problems
       This release is known not to build on Windows 95.

Reporting Bugs
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
       recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
       database at http://bugs.perl.org.  There may also be information at
       http://www.perl.org, the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
       included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
       sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of "perl
       -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
       porting team.  You can browse and search the Perl 5 bugs at
       http://bugs.perl.org/
