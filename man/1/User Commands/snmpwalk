SNMPWALK(1)                         Net-SNMP                         SNMPWALK(1)



NAME
       snmpwalk - retrieve a subtree of management values using SNMP GETNEXT
       requests

SYNOPSIS
       snmpwalk [APPLICATION OPTIONS] [COMMON OPTIONS] AGENT [OID]

DESCRIPTION
       snmpwalk is an SNMP application that uses SNMP GETNEXT requests to query
       a network entity for a tree of information.

       An object identifier (OID) may be given on the command line.  This OID
       specifies which portion of the object identifier space will be searched
       using GETNEXT requests.  All variables in the subtree below the given OID
       are queried and their values presented to the user.  Each variable name
       is given in the format specified in variables(5).

       If no OID argument is present, snmpwalk will search the subtree rooted at
       SNMPv2-SMI::mib-2 (including any MIB object values from other MIB
       modules, that are defined as lying within this subtree).  If the network
       entity has an error processing the request packet, an error packet will
       be returned and a message will be shown, helping to pinpoint why the
       request was malformed.

       If the tree search causes attempts to search beyond the end of the MIB,
       the message "End of MIB" will be displayed.

OPTIONS
       -Cc     Do not check whether the returned OIDs are increasing.  Some
               agents (LaserJets are an example) return OIDs out of order, but
               can complete the walk anyway.  Other agents return OIDs that are
               out of order and can cause snmpwalk to loop indefinitely.  By
               default, snmpwalk tries to detect this behavior and warns you
               when it hits an agent acting illegally.  Use -Cc to turn off this
               check.

       -CE {OID}
               End the walk at the specified OID, rather than a simple subtree.
               This can be used to walk a partial subtree, selected columns of a
               table, or even two or more tables within a single command.

       -Ci     Include the given OID in the search range.  Normally snmpwalk
               uses GETNEXT requests starting with the OID you specified and
               returns all results in the MIB subtree rooted at that OID.
               Sometimes, you may wish to include the OID specified on the
               command line in the printed results if it is a valid OID in the
               tree itself.  This option lets you do this explicitly.

       -CI     In fact, the given OID will be retrieved automatically if the
               main subtree walk returns no useable values.  This allows a walk
               of a single instance to behave as generally expected, and return
               the specified instance value.  This option turns off this final
               GET request, so a walk of a single instance will return nothing.

       -Cp     Upon completion of the walk, print the number of variables found.

       -Ct     Upon completion of the walk, print the total wall-clock time it
               took to collect the data (in seconds).  Note that the timer is
               started just before the beginning of the data request series and
               stopped just after it finishes.  Most importantly, this means
               that it does not include snmp library initialization, shutdown,
               argument processing, and any other overhead.

       In addition to these options, snmpwalk takes the common options described
       in the snmpcmd(1) manual page.

EXAMPLES
       Note that snmpbulkget REQUIRES  an argument specifying the agent to query
       and at most one OID argument, as described there.  The command:

       snmpwalk -Os -c public -v 1 zeus system

       will retrieve all of the variables under system:

       sysDescr.0 = STRING: "SunOS zeus.net.cmu.edu 4.1.3_U1 1 sun4m"
       sysObjectID.0 = OID: enterprises.hp.nm.hpsystem.10.1.1
       sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks: (155274552) 17 days, 23:19:05
       sysContact.0 = STRING: ""
       sysName.0 = STRING: "zeus.net.cmu.edu"
       sysLocation.0 = STRING: ""
       sysServices.0 = INTEGER: 72
       (plus the contents of the sysORTable).

       The command:

       snmpwalk -Os -c public -v 1 -CE sysORTable zeus system

       will retrieve the scalar values, but omit the sysORTable.
