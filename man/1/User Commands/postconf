DESCRIPTION
       By default, the postconf(1) command displays the values of main.cf
       configuration parameters, and warns about possible mis-typed parameter
       names (Postfix 2.9 and later).  The command can also change main.cf
       configuration parameter values, or display other configuration
       information about the Postfix mail system.

       Options:

       -a     List the available SASL plug-in types for the Postfix SMTP server.
              The plug-in type is selected with the smtpd_sasl_type
              configuration parameter by specifying one of the names listed
              below.

              cyrus  This server plug-in is available when Postfix is built with
                     Cyrus SASL support.

              dovecot
                     This server plug-in uses the Dovecot authentication server,
                     and is available when Postfix is built with any form of
                     SASL support.

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.3 and later.

       -A     List the available SASL plug-in types for the Postfix SMTP client.
              The plug-in type is selected with the smtp_sasl_type or
              lmtp_sasl_type configuration parameters by specifying one of the
              names listed below.

              cyrus  This client plug-in is available when Postfix is built with
                     Cyrus SASL support.

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.3 and later.

       -b [template_file]
              Display the message text that appears at the beginning of delivery
              status notification (DSN) messages, expanding $name expressions
              with actual values as described in bounce(5).

              To override the bounce_template_file parameter setting, specify a
              template file name at the end of the "postconf -b" command line.
              Specify an empty file name to display built-in templates (in shell
              language: "").

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.3 and later.

       -c config_dir
              The main.cf configuration file is in the named directory instead
              of the default configuration directory.

       -C class,...
              When displaying main.cf parameters, select only parameters from
              the specified class(es):

              builtin
                     Parameters with built-in names.

              service
                     Parameters with service-defined names (the first field of a
                     master.cf entry plus a Postfix-defined suffix).

              user   Parameters with user-defined names.

              all    All the above classes.

              The default is as if "-C all" is specified.

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.9 and later.

       -d     Print main.cf default parameter settings instead of actual
              settings.  Specify -df to fold long lines for human readability
              (Postfix 2.9 and later).

       -e     Edit the main.cf configuration file, and update parameter settings
              with the "name=value" pairs on the postconf(1) command line.

              With -M, edit the master.cf configuration file, and replace one or
              more service entries with new values as specified with
              "service/type=value" on the postconf(1) command line.

              With -F, edit the master.cf configuration file, and replace one or
              more service fields with new values as specified with
              "service/type/field=value" on the postconf(1) command line.
              Currently, the "command" field contains the command name and
              command arguments.  this may change in the near future, so that
              the "command" field contains only the command name, and a new
              "arguments" pseudofield contains the command arguments.

              With -P, edit the master.cf configuration file, and add or update
              one or more service parameter settings (-o parameter=value
              settings) with new values as specified with
              "service/type/parameter=value" on the postconf(1) command line.

              In all cases the file is copied to a temporary file then renamed
              into place.  Specify quotes to protect special characters and
              whitespace on the postconf(1) command line.

              The -e option is no longer needed with Postfix version 2.8 and
              later.

       -f     Fold long lines when printing main.cf or master.cf configuration
              file entries, for human readability.

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.9 and later.

       -F     Show master.cf per-entry field settings (by default all services
              and all fields), formatted as "service/type/field=value", one per
              line. Specify -Ff to fold long lines.

              Specify one or more "service/type/field" instances on the
              postconf(1) command line to limit the output to fields of
              interest.  Trailing parameter name or service type fields that are
              omitted will be handled as "*" wildcard fields.

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.11 and later.

       -h     Show parameter or attribute values without the "name = " label
              that normally precedes the value.

       -H     Show parameter or attribute names without the " = value" that
              normally follows the name.

              This feature is available with Postfix 3.1 and later.

       -l     List the names of all supported mailbox locking methods.  Postfix
              supports the following methods:

              flock  A kernel-based advisory locking method for local files
                     only.  This locking method is available on systems with a
                     BSD compatible library.

              fcntl  A kernel-based advisory locking method for local and remote
                     files.

              dotlock
                     An application-level locking method. An application locks a
                     file named filename by creating a file named filename.lock.
                     The application is expected to remove its own lock file, as
                     well as stale lock files that were left behind after
                     abnormal program termination.

       -m     List the names of all supported lookup table types. In Postfix
              configuration files, lookup tables are specified as type:name,
              where type is one of the types listed below. The table name syntax
              depends on the lookup table type as described in the
              DATABASE_README document.

              btree  A sorted, balanced tree structure.  Available on systems
                     with support for Berkeley DB databases.

              cdb    A read-optimized structure with no support for incremental
                     updates.  Available on systems with support for CDB
                     databases.

                     This feature is available with Postfix 2.2 and later.

              cidr   A table that associates values with Classless Inter-Domain
                     Routing (CIDR) patterns. This is described in
                     cidr_table(5).

                     This feature is available with Postfix 2.2 and later.

              dbm    An indexed file type based on hashing.  Available on
                     systems with support for DBM databases.

              environ
                     The UNIX process environment array. The lookup key is the
                     environment variable name; the table name is ignored.
                     Originally implemented for testing, someone may find this
                     useful someday.

              fail   A table that reliably fails all requests. The lookup table
                     name is used for logging. This table exists to simplify
                     Postfix error tests.

                     This feature is available with Postfix 2.9 and later.

              hash   An indexed file type based on hashing.  Available on
                     systems with support for Berkeley DB databases.

              inline (read-only)
                     A non-shared, in-memory lookup table. Example: "inline:{
                     key=value, { key = text with whitespace or comma }}".
                     Key-value pairs are separated by whitespace or comma;
                     whitespace after "{" and before "}" is ignored. Inline
                     tables eliminate the need to create a database file for
                     just a few fixed elements.  See also the static: map type.

                     This feature is available with Postfix 3.0 and later.

              internal
                     A non-shared, in-memory hash table. Its content are lost
                     when a process terminates.

              lmdb   OpenLDAP LMDB database (a memory-mapped, persistent file).
                     Available on systems with support for LMDB databases.  This
                     is described in lmdb_table(5).

                     This feature is available with Postfix 2.11 and later.

              ldap (read-only)
                     LDAP database client. This is described in ldap_table(5).

              memcache
                     Memcache database client. This is described in
                     memcache_table(5).

                     This feature is available with Postfix 2.9 and later.

              mysql (read-only)
                     MySQL database client.  Available on systems with support
                     for MySQL databases.  This is described in mysql_table(5).

              pcre (read-only)
                     A lookup table based on Perl Compatible Regular
                     Expressions.  The file format is described in
                     pcre_table(5).

              pgsql (read-only)
                     PostgreSQL database client. This is described in
                     pgsql_table(5).

                     This feature is available with Postfix 2.1 and later.

              pipemap (read-only)
                     A lookup table that constructs a pipeline of tables.
                     Example: "pipemap:{type_1:name_1,  ..., type_n:name_n}".
                     Each "pipemap:" query is given to the first table.  Each
                     lookup result becomes the query for the next table in the
                     pipeline, and the last table produces the final result.
                     When any table lookup produces no result, the pipeline
                     produces no result. The first and last characters of the
                     "pipemap:" table name must be "{" and "}".  Within these,
                     individual maps are separated with comma or whitespace.

                     This feature is available with Postfix 3.0 and later.

              proxy  Postfix proxymap(8) client for shared access to Postfix
                     databases. The table name syntax is type:name.

                     This feature is available with Postfix 2.0 and later.

              randmap (read-only)
                     An in-memory table that performs random selection. Example:
                     "randmap:{result_1, ..., result_n}". Each table query
                     returns a random choice from the specified results. The
                     first and last characters of the "randmap:" table name must
                     be "{" and "}".  Within these, individual results are
                     separated with comma or whitespace. To give a specific
                     result more weight, specify it multiple times.

                     This feature is available with Postfix 3.0 and later.

              regexp (read-only)
                     A lookup table based on regular expressions. The file
                     format is described in regexp_table(5).

              sdbm   An indexed file type based on hashing.  Available on
                     systems with support for SDBM databases.

                     This feature is available with Postfix 2.2 and later.

              socketmap (read-only)
                     Sendmail-style socketmap client. The table name is
                     inet:host:port:name for a TCP/IP server, or
                     unix:pathname:name for a UNIX-domain server. This is
                     described in socketmap_table(5).

                     This feature is available with Postfix 2.10 and later.

              sqlite (read-only)
                     SQLite database. This is described in sqlite_table(5).

                     This feature is available with Postfix 2.8 and later.

              static (read-only)
                     A table that always returns its name as lookup result. For
                     example, static:foobar always returns the string foobar as
                     lookup result. Specify "static:{ text with whitespace }"
                     when the result contains whitespace; this form ignores
                     whitespace after "{" and before "}". See also the inline:
                     map.

                     The form "static:{text} is available with Postfix 3.0 and
                     later.

              tcp (read-only)
                     TCP/IP client. The protocol is described in tcp_table(5).

              texthash (read-only)
                     Produces similar results as hash: files, except that you
                     don't need to run the postmap(1) command before you can use
                     the file, and that it does not detect changes after the
                     file is read.

                     This feature is available with Postfix 2.8 and later.

              unionmap (read-only)
                     A table that sends each query to multiple lookup tables and
                     that concatenates all found results, separated by comma.
                     The table name syntax is the same as for pipemap.

                     This feature is available with Postfix 3.0 and later.

              unix (read-only)
                     A limited view of the UNIX authentication database. The
                     following tables are implemented:

                     unix:passwd.byname
                            The table is the UNIX password database. The key is
                            a login name.  The result is a password file entry
                            in passwd(5) format.

                     unix:group.byname
                            The table is the UNIX group database. The key is a
                            group name.  The result is a group file entry in
                            group(5) format.

              Other table types may exist depending on how Postfix was built.

       -M     Show master.cf file contents instead of main.cf file contents.
              Specify -Mf to fold long lines for human readability.

              Specify zero or more arguments, each with a service-name or
              service-name/service-type pair, where service-name is the first
              field of a master.cf entry and service-type is one of (inet, unix,
              fifo, or pass).

              If service-name or service-name/service-type is specified, only
              the matching master.cf entries will be output. For example,
              "postconf -Mf smtp" will output all services named "smtp", and
              "postconf -Mf smtp/inet" will output only the smtp service that
              listens on the network.  Trailing service type fields that are
              omitted will be handled as "*" wildcard fields.

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.9 and later. The syntax
              was changed from "name.type" to "name/type", and "*" wildcard
              support was added with Postfix 2.11.

       -n     Show only configuration parameters that have explicit name=value
              settings in main.cf.  Specify -nf to fold long lines for human
              readability (Postfix 2.9 and later).

       -o name=value
              Override main.cf parameter settings.

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.10 and later.

       -p     Show main.cf parameter settings. This is the default.

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.11 and later.

       -P     Show master.cf service parameter settings (by default all services
              and all parameters), formatted as "service/type/parameter=value",
              one per line.  Specify -Pf to fold long lines.

              Specify one or more "service/type/parameter" instances on the
              postconf(1) command line to limit the output to parameters of
              interest.  Trailing parameter name or service type fields that are
              omitted will be handled as "*" wildcard fields.

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.11 and later.

       -t [template_file]
              Display the templates for text that appears at the beginning of
              delivery status notification (DSN) messages, without expanding
              $name expressions.

              To override the bounce_template_file parameter setting, specify a
              template file name at the end of the "postconf -t" command line.
              Specify an empty file name to display built-in templates (in shell
              language: "").

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.3 and later.

       -T mode
              If Postfix is compiled without TLS support, the -T option produces
              no output.  Otherwise, if an invalid mode is specified, the -T
              option reports an error and exits with a non-zero status code. The
              valid modes are:

              compile-version
                     Output the OpenSSL version that Postfix was compiled with
                     (i.e. the OpenSSL version in a header file). The output
                     format is the same as with the command "openssl version".

              run-version
                     Output the OpenSSL version that Postfix is linked with at
                     runtime (i.e. the OpenSSL version in a shared library).

              public-key-algorithms
                     Output the lower-case names of the supported public-key
                     algorithms, one per-line.

              This feature is available with Postfix 3.1 and later.

       -v     Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple -v options
              make the software increasingly verbose.

       -x     Expand $name in main.cf or master.cf parameter values. The
              expansion is recursive.

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.10 and later.

       -X     Edit the main.cf configuration file, and remove the parameters
              named on the postconf(1) command line.  Specify a list of
              parameter names, not "name=value" pairs.

              With -M, edit the master.cf configuration file, and remove one or
              more service entries as specified with "service/type" on the
              postconf(1) command line.

              With -P, edit the master.cf configuration file, and remove one or
              more service parameter settings (-o parameter=value settings) as
              specified with "service/type/parameter" on the postconf(1) command
              line.

              In all cases the file is copied to a temporary file then renamed
              into place.  Specify quotes to protect special characters on the
              postconf(1) command line.

              There is no postconf(1) command to perform the reverse operation.

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.10 and later.  Support
              for -M and -P was added with Postfix 2.11.

       -#     Edit the main.cf configuration file, and comment out the
              parameters named on the postconf(1) command line, so that those
              parameters revert to their default values.  Specify a list of
              parameter names, not "name=value" pairs.

              With -M, edit the master.cf configuration file, and comment out
              one or more service entries as specified with "service/type" on
              the postconf(1) command line.

              In all cases the file is copied to a temporary file then renamed
              into place.  Specify quotes to protect special characters on the
              postconf(1) command line.

              There is no postconf(1) command to perform the reverse operation.

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.6 and later. Support for
              -M was added with Postfix 2.11.
