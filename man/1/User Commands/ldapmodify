DESCRIPTION
       ldapmodify is a shell-accessible interface to the ldap_add_ext(3),
       ldap_modify_ext(3), ldap_delete_ext(3) and ldap_rename(3).  library
       calls.  ldapadd is implemented as a hard link to the ldapmodify tool.
       When invoked as ldapadd the -a (add new entry) flag is turned on
       automatically.

       ldapmodify opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds, and modifies or
       adds entries.  The entry information is read from standard input or from
       file through the use of the -f option.

OPTIONS
       -a     Add new entries.  The default for ldapmodify is to modify existing
              entries.  If invoked as ldapadd, this flag is always set.

       -c     Continuous operation mode.  Errors are reported, but ldapmodify
              will continue with modifications.  The default is to exit after
              reporting an error.

       -S_file
              Add or change records which were skipped due to an error are
              written to file and the error message returned by the server is
              added as a comment. Most useful in conjunction with -c.

       -n     Show what would be done, but don't actually modify entries.
              Useful for debugging in conjunction with -v.

       -v     Use verbose mode, with many diagnostics written to standard
              output.

       -M[M]  Enable manage DSA IT control.  -MM makes control critical.

       -d_debuglevel
              Set the LDAP debugging level to debuglevel.  ldapmodify must be
              compiled with LDAP_DEBUG defined for this option to have any
              effect.

       -f_file
              Read the entry modification information from file instead of from
              standard input.

       -x     Use simple authentication instead of SASL.

       -D_binddn
              Use the Distinguished Name binddn to bind to the LDAP directory.
              For SASL binds, the server is expected to ignore this value.

       -W     Prompt for simple authentication.  This is used instead of
              specifying the password on the command line.

       -w_passwd
              Use passwd as the password for simple authentication.

       -y_passwdfile
              Use complete contents of passwdfile as the password for simple
              authentication.

       -H_ldapuri
              Specify URI(s) referring to the ldap server(s); only the
              protocol/host/port fields are allowed; a list of URI, separated by
              whitespace or commas is expected.

       -h_ldaphost
              Specify an alternate host on which the ldap server is running.
              Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -p_ldapport
              Specify an alternate TCP port where the ldap server is listening.
              Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -P {2|3}
              Specify the LDAP protocol version to use.

       -O_security-properties
              Specify SASL security properties.

       -e [!]ext[=extparam]

       -E [!]ext[=extparam]

              Specify general extensions with -e and search extensions with -E.
              ´!´ indicates criticality.

              General extensions:
                [!]assert=<filter>   (an RFC 4515 Filter)
                [!]authzid=<authzid> ("dn:<dn>" or "u:<user>")
                [!]manageDSAit
                [!]noop
                ppolicy
                [!]postread[=<attrs>]        (a comma-separated attribute list)
                [!]preread[=<attrs>] (a comma-separated attribute list)
                abandon, cancel (SIGINT sends abandon/cancel; not really controls)

              Search extensions:
                [!]domainScope                               (domain scope)
                [!]mv=<filter>                               (matched values filter)
                [!]pr=<size>[/prompt|noprompt]       (paged results/prompt)
                [!]sss=[-]<attr[:OID]>[/[-]<attr[:OID]>...]  (server side sorting)
                [!]subentries[=true|false]           (subentries)
                [!]sync=ro[/<cookie>]                        (LDAP Sync refreshOnly)
                        rp[/<cookie>][/<slimit>]     (LDAP Sync refreshAndPersist)

       -I     Enable SASL Interactive mode.  Always prompt.  Default is to
              prompt only as needed.

       -Q     Enable SASL Quiet mode.  Never prompt.

       -U_authcid
              Specify the authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of the ID
              depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -R_realm
              Specify the realm of authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of
              the realm depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -X_authzid
              Specify the requested authorization ID for SASL bind.  authzid
              must be one of the following formats: dn:<distinguished name> or
              u:<username>

       -Y_mech
              Specify the SASL mechanism to be used for authentication. If it's
              not specified, the program will choose the best mechanism the
              server knows.

       -Z[Z]  Issue StartTLS (Transport Layer Security) extended operation. If
              you use -ZZ, the command will require the operation to be
              successful.

INPUT FORMAT
       The contents of file (or standard input if no -f flag is given on the
       command line) must conform to the format defined in ldif(5) (LDIF as
       defined in RFC 2849).

EXAMPLES
       Assuming that the file /tmp/entrymods exists and has the contents:

           dn: cn=Modify Me,dc=example,dc=com
           changetype: modify
           replace: mail
           mail: modme@example.com
           -
           add: title
           title: Grand Poobah
           -
           add: jpegPhoto
           jpegPhoto:< file:///tmp/modme.jpeg
           -
           delete: description
           -

       the command:

           ldapmodify -f /tmp/entrymods

       will replace the contents of the "Modify Me" entry's mail attribute with
       the value "modme@example.com", add a title of "Grand Poobah", and the
       contents of the file "/tmp/modme.jpeg" as a jpegPhoto, and completely
       remove the description attribute.

       Assuming that the file /tmp/newentry exists and has the contents:

           dn: cn=Barbara Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
           objectClass: person
           cn: Barbara Jensen
           cn: Babs Jensen
           sn: Jensen
           title: the world's most famous mythical manager
           mail: bjensen@example.com
           uid: bjensen

       the command:

           ldapadd -f /tmp/newentry

       will add a new entry for Babs Jensen, using the values from the file
       /tmp/newentry.

       Assuming that the file /tmp/entrymods exists and has the contents:

           dn: cn=Barbara Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
           changetype: delete

       the command:

           ldapmodify -f /tmp/entrymods

       will remove Babs Jensen's entry.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit status is zero if no errors occur.  Errors result in a non-zero exit
       status and a diagnostic message being written to standard error.
