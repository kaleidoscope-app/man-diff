PATHCHK(1)                   General Commands Manual                  PATHCHK(1)

NAME
     pathchk – check pathnames

SYNOPSIS
     pathchk [-p] pathname ...

DESCRIPTION
     The pathchk utility checks whether each of the specified pathname arguments
     is valid or portable.

     A diagnostic message is written for each argument that:

     •   Is longer than PATH_MAX bytes.

     •   Contains any component longer than NAME_MAX bytes.  (The value of
         NAME_MAX depends on the underlying file system.)

     •   Contains a directory component that is not searchable.

     It is not considered an error if a pathname argument contains a nonexistent
     component as long as a component by that name could be created.

     The options are as follows:

     -p      Perform portability checks on the specified pathname arguments.
             Diagnostic messages will be written for each argument that:

             •   Is longer than _POSIX_PATH_MAX (255) bytes.

             •   Contains a component longer than _POSIX_NAME_MAX (14) bytes.

             •   Contains any character not in the portable filename character
                 set (that is, alphanumeric characters, ‘.’, ‘-’ and ‘_’).  No
                 component may start with the hyphen (‘-’) character.

EXAMPLES
     Check whether the names of files in the current directory are portable to
     other POSIX systems:

           find . -print | xargs pathchk -p

DIAGNOSTICS
     The pathchk utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
