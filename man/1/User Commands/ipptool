SYNOPSIS
       ipptool [ --help ] [ --ippserver filename ] [ --stop-after-include-error
       ] [ --version ] [ -4 ] [ -6 ] [ -C ] [ -E ] [ -I ] [ -L ] [ -P

DESCRIPTION
       ipptool sends IPP requests to the specified printer-uri and tests and/or
       displays the results.  Each named testfile defines one or more requests,
       including the expected response status, attributes, and values.  Output
       is either a plain text, formatted text, CSV, or XML report on the
       standard output, with a non-zero exit status indicating that one or more
       tests have failed.  The testfile format is described in ipptoolfile(5).

OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized by ipptool:

       --help
            Shows program help.

       --ippserver filename
            Specifies that the test results should be written to the named
            ippserver attributes file.

       --stop-after-include-error
            Tells ipptool to stop if an error occurs in an included file.
            Normally ipptool will continue with subsequent tests after the
            INCLUDE directive.

       --version
            Shows the version of ipptool being used.

       -4   Specifies that ipptool must connect to the printer or server using
            IPv4.

       -6   Specifies that ipptool must connect to the printer or server using
            IPv6.

       -C   Specifies that requests should be sent using the HTTP/1.1
            "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header, which is required for
            conformance by all versions of IPP.  The default is to use
            "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" for requests with attached files and
            "Content-Length:" for requests without attached files.

       -E   Forces TLS encryption when connecting to the server using the HTTP
            "Upgrade" header.

       -I   Specifies that ipptool will continue past errors.

       -L   Specifies that requests should be sent using the HTTP/1.0
            "Content-Length:" header, which is required for conformance by all
            versions of IPP.  The default is to use "Transfer-Encoding: chunked"
            for requests with attached files and "Content-Length:" for requests
            without attached files.

       -P_filename.plist
            Specifies that the test results should be written to the named XML
            (Apple plist) file in addition to the regular test report (-t).
            This option is incompatible with the -i (interval) and -n
            (repeat-count) options.

       -S   Forces (dedicated) TLS encryption when connecting to the server.

       -T_seconds
            Specifies a timeout for IPP requests in seconds.

       -V_version
            Specifies the default IPP version to use: 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, or
            2.2. If not specified, version 1.1 is used.

       -X   Specifies that XML (Apple plist) output is desired instead of the
            plain text report.  This option is incompatible with the -i
            (interval) and -n (repeat-count) options.

       -c   Specifies that CSV (comma-separated values) output is desired
            instead of the plain text output.

       -d_name=value
            Defines the named variable.

       -f_filename
            Defines the default request filename for tests.

       -h   Validate HTTP response headers.

       -i_seconds
            Specifies that the (last) testfile should be repeated at the
            specified interval.  This option is incompatible with the -X (XML
            plist output) option.

       -l   Specifies that plain text output is desired.

       -n_repeat-count
            Specifies that the (last) testfile should be repeated the specified
            number of times.  This option is incompatible with the -X (XML plist
            output) option.

       -q   Be quiet and produce no output.

       -t   Specifies that CUPS test report output is desired instead of the
            plain text output.

       -v   Specifies that all request and response attributes should be output
            in CUPS test mode (-t).  This is the default for XML output.

EXIT STATUS
       The ipptool program returns 0 if all tests were successful and 1
       otherwise.
