NAME
       toe - table of (terminfo) entries

SYNOPSIS
       toe [-v[n]] [-ahuUV] file...

DESCRIPTION
       With no options, toe lists all available terminal types by primary name
       with descriptions.  File arguments specify the directories to be scanned;
       if no such arguments are given, your default terminfo directory is
       scanned.  If you also specify the -h option, a directory header will be
       issued as each directory is entered.

       There are other options intended for use by terminfo file maintainers:

       -a     report on all of the terminal databases which ncurses would
              search, rather than only the first one that it finds.

       -u file
              says to write a report to the standard output, listing
              dependencies in the given terminfo/termcap source file.  The
              report condenses the `use' relation: each line consists of the
              primary name of a terminal that has use capabilities, followed by
              a colon, followed by the whitespace-separated primary names of all
              terminals which occur in those use capabilities, followed by a
              newline

       -U file
              says to write a report to the standard output, listing reverse
              dependencies in the given terminfo/termcap source file.  The
              report reverses the `use' relation: each line consists of the
              primary name of a terminal that occurs in use capabilities,
              followed by a colon, followed by the whitespace-separated primary
              names of all terminals which depend on it, followed by a newline.

       -vn    specifies that (verbose) output be written to standard error,
              showing toe's progress.  The optional parameter n is a number from
              1 to 10, interpreted as for tic(1M).

       -V     reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and
              exits.
