NAME
       sn_scsi_resize - Utility to resize a virtual volume

SYNOPSIS
       sn_scsi_resize [options] [devname1 devname3 devname3...]

DESCRIPTION
       sn_scsi_resize is a utility that can be used to tell the disk driver
       infrastructure in the Linux operating system to get the size of a volume.
       The size of a volume may have increased, particularly in the case of a
       thin provisioned volume.  The Linux device driver stack does not
       automatically detect size changes.

       If no devnames are specified, sn_scsi_resize will rescan all multipath
       devices and their slaves.

       Devnames may be specified as absolute paths like /sys/block/dm-3,
       /sys/block/dm*, /sys/block/sdg, or shorthand like mpatha, mpathb
       representing /dev/mapper files.

       sn_scsi_resize will execute a StorNext disk refresh after the SCSI
       devices have been resized.


OPTIONS
       -?     Display usage and exit.

       -h     Help. Display usage and exit.

       -l     List.  This option will list the device sizes.  No size rescan is
              done.

       -v     Verbose.  Display the sizes of the devices.  Similar to the list
              option but works during resize.

EXAMPLES
       Rescan all multipath devices and their slaves:

              sn_scsi_resize

       Rescan the multipath device dm-3 and its slaves:

              sn_scsi_resize /sys/block/dm-3

       Rescan the multipath device /dev/mapper/mpatha and /dev/mapper/mpathb
       and their slaves:

              sn_scsi_resize mpatha mpathb

       List the sizes of all device and their slaves:

              sn_scsi_resize -l



NOTES
       sn_scsi_resize is currently supported only on Linux.

       Devices representing partitions cannot be resized.  Error messages are
       suppressed unless the -v option is specified.
