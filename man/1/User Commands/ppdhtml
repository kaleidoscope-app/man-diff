NAME
       ppdhtml - cups html summary generator (deprecated)

SYNOPSIS
       ppdhtml [ -D name[=value] ] [ -I include-directory ] source-file

DESCRIPTION
       ppdhtml reads a driver information file and produces a HTML summary page
       that lists all of the drivers in a file and the supported options.  This
       program is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of CUPS.

OPTIONS
       ppdhtml supports the following options:

       -D name[=value]
            Sets the named variable for use in the source file.  It is
            equivalent to using the #define directive in the source file.

       -I include-directory
            Specifies an alternate include directory.  Multiple -I options can
            be supplied to add additional directories.

NOTES
       PPD files are deprecated and will no longer be supported in a future
       feature release of CUPS.  Printers that do not support IPP can be
       supported using applications such as ippeveprinter(1).
