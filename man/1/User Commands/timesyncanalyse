NAME
     timesyncanalyse â€“ time synchronization analysis tool.

SYNOPSIS
     timesyncanalyse mode <arguments>

DESCRIPTION
     The timesyncanalyse executable is used for analysis of test data for time
     synchronization testing.


     The following modes are available:

     audio
         Determine the time error between 2 audio signals and how it changes
         over time. Produces both plots and CSV data files (and scripts to plot
         them) of the calculated time error, the Allan Deviation (ADEV), the
         Modified Allan Deviation (MADEV), the Time Deviation (TDEV) and the
         Maximum Time Interval Error (MTIE).

     time-error
         Load the time error CSV file as previously output by a call the tool
         with the audio mode and analyse the data. Produces both plots and CSV
         data files (and scripts to plot them) of the Allan Deviation (ADEV),
         the Modified Allan Deviation (MADEV), the Time Deviation (TDEV) and the
         Maximum Time Interval Error (MTIE).


     The following options are available for the audio mode:

     --channel-a path
         The path to the audio file for channel A of the analysis, only the
         first channel of the file is used.

     --channel-b path
         The path to the audio file for channel B of the analysis, only the
         first channel of the file is used. The sample rate and length of the
         file must match that of channel A.

     --output path
         Specifies the path to the directory to put all of the output data from
         the analysis. Creates the directory if it does not exist.

     [--name name]
         The name to use for the results. This is used in the title of the plots
         and the naming of the output files. If not provided the default of
         audio_analysis is used.

     --interval interval
         The interval, in samples, at which the analysis is performed.

     [--upscale upscale]
         The amount of upsampling to perform to the audio before running the
         analysis. If not specified 1 is used.

     --length length
         The length, in samples, of the section of the original audio that is
         used for the correlation to determine the error.

     [--type quick|resampler|post-resampler]
         Select which type of drift correlator is used. Quick uses a quadratic
         interpolation post correlation, resampler performs resampling of the
         signal before correlation and post-resampler performs resampling of the
         correlated signal. Quadratic interpollation results can have some error
         present but runs much faster than resampling. Quadratic interpollation
         can be used to do a quick analysis before spending time doing the full
         analysis. Post resampling, where the correlation signal is upsampled is
         much quicker than resampling prior to correlation but can produce
         slightly different results when the drift is right on the edge of a
         quantization level. post-resampler is the default mode if nothing is
         specified.

     [--audio-limit seconds]
         Limit the audio analysis to the first N seconds of audio in the file.

     [--window-lower lower-limit]
         Specify the smallest window size to perform the analysis on. This
         directlty relates to the smallest observation interval plotted where
         the observation interval = the window length * the time error sampling
         period (number of seconds between time error points). The sampling
         period of the time error data is the interval / sampling rate of the
         audio file. The default (and smallest) value is 2.

     [--window-upper upper-limit]
         Specify the largest window size to perform the analysis on. This
         directlty relates to the largest observation interval plotted where the
         observation interval = the window length * the time error sampling
         period (number of seconds between time error points). The sampling
         period of the time error data is the interval / sampling rate of the
         audio file. The default value is the number of time error points in the
         data.

     [--window-step step-size]
         Specify the window size step to step between each analysis calculation.
         Adjusting this value will speed up the analysis of the data but produce
         lower resolution plots. The default value is 1.

     [--adev | --no-adev]
         Either calculate or don't calculate the Allan Deviation on the time
         error data. If unspecified the Allan deviation is calculated.

     [--madev | --no-madev]
         Either calculate pr don't calculate the Modified Allan Deviation on the
         time error data. If unspecified the Modified Allan deviation is
         calculated.

     [--tdev | --no-tdev]
         Either calculate or don't calculate the Time Deviation on the time
         error data. If unspecified the Time deviation is calculated.

     [--rmstie | --no-rmstie]
         Either calculate or don't calculate the Root Mean Squared Time Interval
         Error on the time error data. If unspecified the RMSTIE is calculated.

     [--mtie | --no-mtie]
         Either calculate or don't calculate the Maximum Time Interval Error on
         the time error data. If unspecified the MTIE is calculated.


     The following options are available for the time-error mode:

     --data path
         The path to the time error CSV file. Both the time and the time error
         should be in seconds (floating point).

     --output path
         Specifies the path to the directory to put all of the output data from
         the analysis. Creates the directory if it does not exist.

     [--name name]
         The name to use for the results. This is used in the title of the plots
         and the naming of the output files. If not provided the default of
         time-error_analysis is used.

     [--window-lower lower-limit]
         Specify the smallest window size to perform the analysis on. This
         directlty relates to the smallest observation interval plotted where
         the observation interval = the window length * the time error sampling
         period (number of seconds between time error points). The default (and
         smallest) value is 2.

     [--window-upper upper-limit]
         Specify the largest window size to perform the analysis on. This
         directlty relates to the largest observation interval plotted where the
         observation interval = the window length * the time error sampling
         period (number of seconds between time error points). The default value
         is the number of time error points in the data.

     [--window-step step-size]
         Specify the window size step to step between each analysis calculation.
         Adjusting this value will speed up the analysis of the data but produce
         lower resolution plots. The default value is 1.

     [--adev | --no-adev]

         error data. If unspecified the Allan deviation is calculated.

     [--madev | --no-madev]
