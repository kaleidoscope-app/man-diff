WAIT4PATH(1)                 General Commands Manual                WAIT4PATH(1)

NAME
     wait4path – wait for given path to show up in the namespace

SYNOPSIS
     wait4path ⟨path⟩

DESCRIPTION
     The wait4path program simply checks to see if the given path exists, and if
     so, it exits.  Otherwise, it sleeps until the mount table is updated and
     checks again.  The program will loop indefinitely until the path shows up
     in the file system namespace.
