NAME
       grodvi - convert groff output to TeX dvi format

SYNOPSIS
       grodvi [ -dlv ] [ -Fdir ] [ -ppapersize ] [ -wn ] [ files... ]

       It is possible to have whitespace between a command line option and its
       parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       grodvi is a driver for groff that produces TeX dvi format.  Normally it
       should  be run by groff -Tdvi.  This will run troff -Tdvi; it will also
       input the macros in /usr/share/groff/1.19.2/tmac/dvi.tmac.

       The dvi file generated by grodvi can be printed by any  correctly-writ-
       ten dvi driver.  The troff drawing primitives are implemented using the
       tpic version 2 specials.  If the driver does not support these, the  \D
       commands will not produce any output.

       There is an additional drawing command available:

       \D'R dh dv'
              Draw a rule (solid black rectangle), with one corner at the cur-
              rent position, and the diagonally opposite corner at the current
              position  +(dh,dv).   Afterwards the current position will be at
              the opposite corner.  This produces a rule in the dvi  file  and
              so  can  be printed even with a driver that does not support the
              tpic specials unlike the other \D commands.

       The groff command \X'anything' is translated into the same  command  in
       the  dvi  file  as would be produced by \special{anything} in TeX; any-
       thing may not contain a newline.

       For inclusion of EPS image files, -Tdvi loads pspic.tmac automatically,
       providing  the  PSPIC macro.  Please check groff_tmac(5) for a detailed
       description.

       Font files for grodvi can be created from tfm files using  tfmtodit(1).
       The  font description file should contain the following additional com-
       mands:

       internalname name
                     The name of the tfm file (without the .tfm extension)  is
                     name.

       checksum n    The checksum in the tfm file is n.

       designsize n  The designsize in the tfm file is n.

       These are automatically generated by tfmtodit.

       The default color for \m and \M is black.  Currently, the drawing color
       for \D commands is always black, and fill color values  are  translated
       to gray.

       In  troff  the  \N  escape sequence can be used to access characters by
       their position in the corresponding tfm file; all characters in the tfm
       file can be accessed this way.

       By design, the DVI format doesn't care about physical dimensions of the
       output medium.  Instead, grodvi emits the  equivalent  to  TeX's  \spe-
       cial{papersize=width,length}  on  the  first  page; dvips (and possibly
       other DVI drivers) then sets the page size accordingly.  If either  the
       page width or length is not positive, no papersize special is output.

OPTIONS
       -d     Do  not  use tpic specials to implement drawing commands.  Hori-
              zontal and vertical lines will be implemented by  rules.   Other
              drawing commands will be ignored.

       -Fdir  Prepend  directory  dir/devname  to the search path for font and
              device description files; name is the name of the  device,  usu-
              ally dvi.

       -l     Specify landscape orientation.

       -ppapersize
              Specify  paper dimensions.  This overrides the papersize, paper-
              length, and paperwidth commands in the DESC file; it accepts the
              same  arguments  as the papersize command (see groff_font(5) for
              details).

       -v     Print the version number.

       -wn    Set the default line thickness to n thousandths of  an  em.   If
              this  option  isn't  specified,  the  line thickness defaults to
              0.04 em.

USAGE
       There are styles called R, I, B, and BI mounted  at  font  positions  1
       to 4.   The  fonts  are grouped into families T and H having members in
       each of these styles:

              TR     CM Roman (cmr10)
              TI     CM Text Italic (cmti10)
              TB     CM Bold Extended Roman (cmbx10)
              TBI    CM Bold Extended Text Italic (cmbxti10)
              HR     CM Sans Serif (cmss10)
              HI     CM Slanted Sans Serif (cmssi10)
              HB     CM Sans Serif Bold Extended (cmssbx10)
              HBI    CM Slanted Sans Serif Bold Extended (cmssbxo10)

       There are also the following fonts which are not members of a family:

              CW     CM Typewriter Text (cmtt10)
              CWI    CM Italic Typewriter Text (cmitt10)

       Special fonts are MI (cmmi10), S (cmsy10), EX  (cmex10),  SC  (cmtex10,
       only  for  CW),  and,  perhaps surprisingly, TR, TI, and CW, due to the
       different font encodings of text fonts.  For italic fonts, CWI is  used
       instead of CW.

       Finally,  the  symbol  fonts  of  the American Mathematical Society are
       available as special fonts SA (msam10)  and  SB  (msbm10).   These  two
       fonts are not mounted by default.

       Using  the  option  -mec (which loads the file ec.tmac) provides the EC
       and TC fonts.  The design of the EC family is very similar to  that  of
       the  CM  fonts; additionally, they give a much better coverage of groff
       symbols.  Note that ec.tmac must be called before any language-specific
       files; it doesn't take care of hcode values.

BUGS
       Dvi  files  produced  by grodvi use a different resolution (57816 units
       per inch) to those produced by TeX.  Incorrectly written drivers  which
       assume  the  resolution  used  by TeX, rather than using the resolution
       specified in the dvi file will not work with grodvi.

       When using the -d option with boxed  tables,  vertical  and  horizontal
       lines  can  sometimes  protrude by one pixel.  This is a consequence of
       the way TeX requires that the heights and widths of rules be rounded.
