DESCRIPTION
       "pod2latex" is a program to convert POD format documentation (perlpod)
       into latex. It can process multiple input documents at a time and either
       generate a latex file per input document or a single combined output
       file.

OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS
       This section describes the supported command line options. Minimum
       matching is supported.

       -out
           Name of the output file to be used. If there are multiple input pods
           it is assumed that the intention is to write all translated output
           into a single file. ".tex" is appended if not present.  If the
           argument is not supplied, a single document will be created for each
           input file.

       -full
           Creates a complete "latex" file that can be processed immediately
           (unless "=for/=begin" directives are used that rely on extra
           packages).  Table of contents and index generation commands are
           included in the wrapper "latex" code.

       -sections
           Specify pod sections to include (or remove if negated) in the
           translation.  See "SECTION SPECIFICATIONS" in Pod::Select for the
           format to use for section-spec. This option may be given multiple
           times on the command line.This is identical to the similar option in
           the "podselect()" command.

       -modify
           This option causes the output "latex" to be slightly modified from
           the input pod such that when a "=head1 NAME" is encountered a section
           is created containing the actual pod name (rather than NAME) and all
           subsequent "=head1" directives are treated as subsections. This has
           the advantage that the description of a module will be in its own
           section which is helpful for including module descriptions in
           documentation.  Also forces "latex" label and index entries to be
           prefixed by the name of the module.

       -h1level
           Specifies the "latex" section that is equivalent to a "H1" pod
           directive. This is an integer between 0 and 5 with 0 equivalent to a
           "latex" chapter, 1 equivalent to a "latex" section etc. The default
           is 1 ("H1" equivalent to a latex section).

       -help
           Print a brief help message and exit.

       -man
           Print the manual page and exit.

       -verbose
           Print information messages as each document is processed.

       -preamble
           A user-supplied preamble for the LaTeX code. Multiple values are
           supported and appended in order separated by "\n".  See -prefile for
           reading the preamble from a file.

       -postamble
           A user supplied postamble for the LaTeX code. Multiple values are
           supported and appended in order separated by "\n".  See -postfile for
           reading the postamble from a file.

       -prefile
           A user-supplied preamble for the LaTeX code to be read from the named
           file. Multiple values are supported and appended in order. See
           -preamble.

       -postfile
           A user-supplied postamble for the LaTeX code to be read from the
           named file. Multiple values are supported and appended in order. See
           -postamble.

BUGS
       Known bugs are:

       •   Cross references between documents are not resolved when multiple pod
           documents are converted into a single output "latex" file.

       •   Functions and variables are not automatically recognized and they
           will therefore not be marked up in any special way unless instructed
           by an explicit pod command.
