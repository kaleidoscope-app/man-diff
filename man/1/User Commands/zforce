ZFORCE(1)                    General Commands Manual                   ZFORCE(1)

NAME
     zforce – force gzip files to have a .gz suffix

SYNOPSIS
     zforce file ...

DESCRIPTION
     The zforce utility renames gzip(1) files to have a ‘.gz’ suffix, so that
     gzip(1) will not compress them twice.  This can be useful if file names
     were truncated during a file transfer.  Files that have an existing ‘.gz’,
     ‘-gz’, ‘_gz’, ‘.tgz’ or ‘.taz’ suffix, or that have not been compressed by
     gzip(1), are ignored.

SEE ALSO
     gzip(1)

CAVEATS
     zforce overwrites existing files without warning.
