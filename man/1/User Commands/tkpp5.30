NAME
       tkpp - frontend to pp written in Perl/Tk.

SYNOPSIS
       You just have to execute command line : tkpp

DESCRIPTION
       Tkpp is a GUI frontend to pp, which can turn perl scripts into stand-
       alone PAR files, perl scripts or executables.

       You can save command line generated, load and save your Tkpp
       configuration GUI. Below is a short explanation of tkpp GUI.

   Menu
       File -> Save command line

       When you build or display command line in the Tkpp GUI, you can save the
       command line in a separated file. This command line can be executed from
       a terminal.

       File -> Save configuration

       You can save your GUI configuration (all options used) to load and
       execute it next time.

       File -> Load configuration

       Load your saved file configuration. All saved options will be set in the
       GUI.

       File -> Exit

       Close Tkpp.

       Help -> Tkpp documentation

       Display POD documentation of Tkpp.

       Help -> pp documentation

       Display POD documentation of pp.

       Help -> About Tkpp

       Display version and authors of Tkpp.

       Help -> About pp

       Display version and authors of pp ( pp --version).

   Tabs GUI
       There are five tabs in GUI : General Options, Information, Size, Other
       Options and Output.

       All tabs contain all options which can be used with pp. All default pp
       options are kept.  You can now set as you want the options. When your
       have finished, you can display the command line or start building your
       package. You will have the output tab to see error or verbose messages.

NOTES
       In Win32 system, the building is executed in a separate process, then the
       GUI is not frozen.

       The first time you use Tkpp, it will tell you to install some CPAN
       modules to use the GUI (like Tk, Tk::ColoredButton...).
