NAME
       bashbug - report a bug in bash

SYNOPSIS
       bashbug [address]

DESCRIPTION
       bashbug is a shell script to help the user compose and mail bug reports
       concerning bash in a standard format.  bashbug invokes the editor
       specified by the environment variable EDITOR on a temporary copy of the
       bug report format outline. The user must fill in the appropriate fields
       and exit the editor.  bashbug then mails the completed report to bug-
       bash@gnu.org, or address.  If the report cannot be mailed, it is saved in
       the file dead.bashbug in the invoking user's home directory.

       The bug report format outline consists of several sections.  The first
       section provides information about the machine, operating system, the
       bash version, and the compilation environment.  The second section should
       be filled in with a description of the bug.  The third section should be
       a description of how to reproduce the bug.  The optional fourth section
       is for a proposed fix.  Fixes are encouraged.

ENVIRONMENT
       bashbug will utilize the following environment variables if they exist:

       EDITOR Specifies the preferred editor. If EDITOR is not set, bashbug
              defaults to emacs.

       HOME   Directory in which the failed bug report is saved if the mail
              fails.
