SNMPTEST(1)                         Net-SNMP                         SNMPTEST(1)



NAME
       snmptest - communicates with a network entity using SNMP requests

SYNOPSIS
       snmptest [COMMON OPTIONS] AGENT

DESCRIPTION
       snmptest is a flexible SNMP application that can monitor and manage
       information on a network entity.

       After invoking the program, a command line interpreter proceeds to accept
       commands.  This intepreter enables the user to send different types of
       SNMP requests to target agents.

       AGENT identifies a target SNMP agent, which is instrumented to monitor
       the given objects.  At its simplest, the AGENT specification will consist
       of a hostname or an IPv4 address.  In this situation, the command will
       attempt communication with the agent, using UDP/IPv4 to port 161 of the
       given target host. See snmpcmd(1) for a full list of the possible formats
       for AGENT.

       Once snmptest is invoked, the command line intepreter will prompt with:

       Variable:

       At this point you can enter one or more variable names, one per line.  A
       blank line ends the parameter input and will send the request (variables
       entered) in a single packet, to the remote entity.  Each variable name is
       given in the format specified in variables(5).  For example:

       snmptest -c public -v 1 zeus
       Variable: system.sysDescr.0
       Variable:

       will return some information about the request and reply packets, as well
       as the information:

       requestid 0x5992478A errstat 0x0 errindex 0x0
       system.sysDescr.0 = STRING: "Unix 4.3BSD"

       The errstatus value shows the error status code for the call.  The
       possible values for errstat are in the header file snmp.h.  The errindex
       value identifies the variable that has the given error.  Index values are
       assigned to all the variables entered at the "Variable": prompt. The
       first value is assigned an index of 1.

       Upon startup, the program defaults to sending a GET request packet.  The
       type of request can be changed by typing one of the following commands at
       the "Variable:" prompt:

       $G - send a GET request
       $N - send a GETNEXT request
       $S - send a SET request
       $B - send a GETBULK request
            Note: GETBULK is not available in SNMPv1
       $I - send an Inform request
       $T - send an SNMPv2 Trap request

       Other values that can be entered at the "Variable:" prompt are:

       $D - toggle the dumping of each sent and received packet
       $QP - toggle a quicker, less verbose output form
       $Q - Quit the program

       Request Types:

       GET Request:

       When in "GET request" mode ($G or default), the user can enter an OID at
       the "Variable:" prompt. The user can enter multiple OIDs, one per prompt.
       The user enters a blank line to send the GET request.

       GETNEXT Request:

       The "GETNEXT request" mode ($N) is simlar to the "Get request" mode,
       described above.

       SET Request:

       When in the "SET request" mode ($S), more information is requested by the
       prompt for each variable.  The prompt:

       Type [i|s|x|d|n|o|t|a]:
       requests the type of the variable be entered.  Depending on the type of
       value you want to set, you can type one of the following:

       i - integer
       u - unsigned integer
       s - octet string in ASCII
       x - octet string in hex bytes, separated by whitespace
       d - octet string as decimal bytes, separated by whitespace
       a - ip address in dotted IP notation
       o - object identifier
       n - null
       t - timeticks
       At this point a value will be prompted for:

       Value:

       If this is an integer value, just type the integer (in decimal).  If it
       is a decimal string, type in white-space separated decimal numbers, one
       per byte of the string.  Again type a blank line at the prompt for the
       variable name to send the packet.

       GETBULK Request:

       The "GETBULK request" mode ($B) is similar to the "Set request" mode.
       GETBULK, however, is not available in SNMPv1.

       Inform Request:

       The "Inform request" mode ($I) is similar to the "Set request" mode.
       This type of request, however, is not available in SNMPv1. Also, the
       _agent_ specified on the snmptest command should correspond to the target
       snmptrapd agent.

       SNMPv2 Trap Request:

       The "SNMPv2 Trap Request" mode ($T) is similar to the "Set request" mode.
       This type of request, however, is not available in SNMPv1. Also, the
       _agent_ specified on the snmptest command should correspond to the target
       snmptrapd agent.

OPTIONS
       snmptest takes the common options described in the snmpcmd(1) manual
       page.
