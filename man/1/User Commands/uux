uux(1)                       General Commands Manual                      uux(1)



NAME
       uux - Remote command execution over UUCP

SYNOPSIS
       uux [ options ] command

DESCRIPTION
       The uux command is used to execute a command on a remote system, or to
       execute a command on the local system using files from remote systems.
       The command is not executed immediately; the request is queued until the
       uucico (8) daemon calls the system and executes it.  The daemon is
       started automatically unless one of the -r or --nouucico options is
       given.

       The actual command execution is done by the uuxqt (8) daemon.

       File arguments can be gathered from remote systems to the execution
       system, as can standard input.  Standard output may be directed to a file
       on a remote system.

       The command name may be preceded by a system name followed by an
       exclamation point if it is to be executed on a remote system.  An empty
       system name is taken as the local system.

       Each argument that contains an exclamation point is treated as naming a
       file.  The system which the file is on is before the exclamation point,
       and the pathname on that system follows it.  An empty system name is
       taken as the local system; this must be used to transfer a file to a
       command being executed on a remote system.  If the path is not absolute,
       it will be appended to the current working directory on the local system;
       the result may not be meaningful on the remote system.  A pathname may
       begin with ~/, in which case it is relative to the UUCP public directory
       (usually /usr/spool/uucppublic or /var/spool/uucppublic) on the
       appropriate system.  A pathname may begin with ~name/, in which case it
       is relative to the home directory of the named user on the appropriate
       system.

       Standard input and output may be redirected as usual; the pathnames used
       may contain exclamation points to indicate that they are on remote
       systems.  Note that the redirection characters must be quoted so that
       they are passed to uux rather than interpreted by the shell.  Append
       redirection (>>) does not work.

       All specified files are gathered together into a single directory before
       execution of the command begins.  This means that each file must have a
       distinct base name.  For example,
            uux 'sys1!diff sys2!~user1/foo sys3!~user2/foo >!foo.diff'
       will fail because both files will be copied to sys1 and stored under the
       name foo.

       Arguments may be quoted by parentheses to avoid interpretation of
       exclamation points.  This is useful when executing the uucp command on a
       remote system.

       A request to execute an empty command (e.g., uux sys!)  will create a
       poll file for the specified system.

       The exit status of uux is one of the codes found in the header file
       sysexits.h.  In particular, EX_OK ( 0 ) indicates success, and
       EX_TEMPFAIL ( 75 ) indicates a temporary failure.

OPTIONS
       The following options may be given to uux.

       -, -p, --stdin
            Read standard input and use it as the standard input for the command
            to be executed.

       -c, --nocopy
            Do not copy local files to the spool directory.  This is the
            default.  If they are removed before being processed by the uucico
            (8) daemon, the copy will fail.  The files must be readable by the
            uucico (8) daemon, as well as the by the invoker of uux.

       -C, --copy
            Copy local files to the spool directory.

       -l, --link
            Link local files into the spool directory.  If a file can not be
            linked because it is on a different device, it will be copied unless
            one of the -c or --nocopy options also appears (in other words, use
            of --link switches the default from --nocopy to --copy).  If the
            files are changed before being processed by the uucico (8) daemon,
            the changed versions will be used.  The files must be readable by
            the uucico (8) daemon, as well as by the invoker of uux.

       -g grade, --grade grade
            Set the grade of the file transfer command.  Jobs of a higher grade
            are executed first.  Grades run 0 ... 9 A ... Z a ... z from high to
            low.

       -n, --notification=no
            Do not send mail about the status of the job, even if it fails.

       -z, --notification=error
            Send mail about the status of the job if an error occurs.  For many
            uuxqt daemons, including the Taylor UUCP uuxqt, this is the default
            action; for those, --notification=error will have no effect.
            However, some uuxqt daemons will send mail if the job succeeds
            unless the --notification=error option is used, and some other uuxqt
            daemons will not send mail if the job fails unless the
            --notification=error option is used.

       -r, --nouucico
            Do not start the uucico (8) daemon immediately; merely queue up the
            execution request for later processing.

       -j, --jobid
            Print jobids on standard output.  A jobid will be generated for each
            file copy operation required to perform the operation.  These file
            copies may be cancelled by passing the jobid to the --kill switch of
            uustat (1), which will make the execution impossible to complete.

       -a address, --requestor address
            Report job status to the specified e-mail address.

       -x type, --debug type
            Turn on particular debugging types.  The following types are
            recognized: abnormal, chat, handshake, uucp-proto, proto, port,
            config, spooldir, execute, incoming, outgoing.  Only abnormal,
            config, spooldir and execute are meaningful for uux.

            Multiple types may be given, separated by commas, and the --debug
            option may appear multiple times.  A number may also be given, which
            will turn on that many types from the foregoing list; for example,
            --debug 2 is equivalent to --debug abnormal,chat.

       -I file, --config file
            Set configuration file to use.  This option may not be available,
            depending upon how uux was compiled.

       -v, --version
            Report version information and exit.

       --help
            Print a help message and exit.

EXAMPLES
       uux -z - sys1!rmail user1
       Execute the command ``rmail user1'' on the system sys1, giving it as
       standard input whatever is given to uux as standard input.  If a failure
       occurs, send a message using mail (1).

       uux 'diff -c sys1!~user1/file1 sys2!~user2/file2 >!file.diff'
       Fetch the two named files from system sys1 and system sys2 and execute
       diff putting the result in file.diff in the current directory.  The
       current directory must be writable by the uuxqt (8) daemon for this to
       work.

       uux 'sys1!uucp ~user1/file1 (sys2!~user2/file2)'
       Execute uucp on the system sys1 copying file1 (on system sys1) to sys2.
       This illustrates the use of parentheses for quoting.

RESTRICTIONS
       The remote system may not permit you to execute certain commands.  Many
       remote systems only permit the execution of rmail and rnews.

       Some of the options are dependent on the capabilities of the uuxqt (8)
       daemon on the remote system.

SEE ALSO
       mail(1), uustat(1), uucp(1), uucico(8), uuxqt(8)

BUGS
       Files can not be referenced across multiple systems.

       Too many jobids are output by --jobid, and there is no good way to cancel
       a local execution requiring remote files.
