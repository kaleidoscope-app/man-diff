CSPLIT(1)                    General Commands Manual                   CSPLIT(1)

NAME
     csplit – split files based on context

SYNOPSIS
     csplit [-ks] [-f prefix] [-n number] file args ...

DESCRIPTION
     The csplit utility splits file into pieces using the patterns args.  If
     file is a dash (‘-’), csplit reads from standard input.

     The options are as follows:

     -f prefix
             Give created files names beginning with prefix.  The default is
             “xx”.

     -k      Do not remove output files if an error occurs or a HUP, INT or TERM
             signal is received.

     -n number
             Use number of decimal digits after the prefix to form the file
             name.  The default is 2.

     -s      Do not write the size of each output file to standard output as it
             is created.

     The args operands may be a combination of the following patterns:

     /regexp/[[+|-]offset]
             Create a file containing the input from the current line to (but
             not including) the next line matching the given basic regular
             expression.  An optional offset from the line that matched may be
             specified.

     %regexp%[[+|-]offset]
             Same as above but a file is not created for the output.

     line_no
             Create containing the input from the current line to (but not
             including) the specified line number.

     {num}   Repeat the previous pattern the specified number of times.  If it
             follows a line number pattern, a new file will be created for each
             line_no lines, num times.  The first line of the file is line
             number 1 for historic reasons.

     After all the patterns have been processed, the remaining input data (if
     there is any) will be written to a new file.

     Requesting to split at a line before the current line number or past the
     end of the file will result in an error.

ENVIRONMENT
     The LANG, LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE and LC_CTYPE environment variables affect the
     execution of csplit as described in environ(7).

EXIT STATUS
     The csplit utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Split the mdoc(7) file foo.1 into one file for each section (up to 20):

           csplit -k foo.1 '%^\.Sh%' '/^\.Sh/' '{20}'

     Split standard input after the first 99 lines and every 100 lines
     thereafter:

           csplit -k - 100 '{19}'

SEE ALSO
     sed(1), split(1), re_format(7)

STANDARDS
     The csplit utility conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”).

HISTORY
     A csplit command appeared in PWB UNIX.

BUGS
     Input lines are limited to LINE_MAX (2048) bytes in length.
