java_home(1)                 General Commands Manual                java_home(1)



NAME
       java_home - return a value for $JAVA_HOME


SYNOPSIS
       /usr/libexec/java_home [options]


DESCRIPTION
       The java_home command returns a path suitable for setting the JAVA_HOME
       environment variable.  It determines this path from the user's preferred
       JVM based on configured environment variables.  Additional constraints
       may be provided to filter the list of JVMs available.  By default, if no
       constraints match the available list of JVMs, the default order is used.
       The path is printed to standard output.


OPTIONS
       -v or --version  version
              Filters the returned JVMs by version (as if JAVA_VERSION had been
              set in the environment). Example versions: "11.0", or "14.0.2".


       -a or --arch  architecture
              Filters the returned JVMs by the architecture they support (as if
              JAVA_ARCH had been set in the environment). Example architectures:
              "x86_64", or "arm64".


       -F or --failfast
              Immediately fails when filters return no JVMs; does not print out
              the path to the default $JAVA_HOME.


       --exec  command ...
              Executes the command at $JAVA_HOME/bin/<command> and passes the
              remaining arguments. Any arguments to select which $JAVA_HOME to
              use must precede the --exec option.


       -X or --xml
              Prints a list of all matching JVMs and associated properties as an
              XML plist to stdout.


       -V or --verbose
              Prints a list of all matching JVMs and architectures to stderr.


       -h or --help
              Brief usage information.


USAGE
       /usr/libexec/java_home helps users set a $JAVA_HOME in their login rc
       files, or provides a way for command-line Java tools to use the most
       appropriate JVM which can satisfy a minimum version or architecture
       requirement. The --exec argument can invoke tools in the selected
       $JAVA_HOME/bin directory, which is useful for starting Java command-line
       tools from launchd plists without hardcoding the full path to the Java
       command-line tool.


       Usage for bash-style shells:
              $ export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home`

       Usage for csh-style shells:
              % setenv JAVA_HOME `/usr/libexec/java_home`
