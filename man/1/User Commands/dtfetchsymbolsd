NAME
     dtfetchsymbolsd â€“ DT Remote service for copying symbol cache files from
     device to host

SYNOPSIS
     dtfetchsymbolsd

DESCRIPTION
     A DT Remote Services daemon responsible for copying symbol cache files from
     device to host so that the other systems like the debugger can use the
     files to symbolicate a backtrace. If those files are not present on the
     host, the debugger would need to read the symbols directly from memory on
     the device and this will slow down the start of every debug session.
