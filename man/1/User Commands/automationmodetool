NAME
     automationmodetool â€“ Manage UI automation security preferences.

SYNOPSIS
     automationmodetool enable-automationmode-without-authentication
     automationmodetool disable-automationmode-without-authentication

DESCRIPTION
     automationmodetool can be used to configure a device such that Automation
     Mode for UI testing can be enabled without user authentication.  This is
     useful for configuring machines in continuous integration (CI) environments
     as well as those in labs where the active users do not have administrator
     privileges. Running the tool for this purpose requires an administrator to
     authenticate in the shell.  If no argument is passed, the tool prints the
     current status of Automation Mode (enabled or disabled), the authentication
     configuration (required or not), and then exits.
