ocspd(1)                     General Commands Manual                    ocspd(1)

NAME
     ocspd â€“ OCSP and CRL Daemon

SYNOPSIS
     ocspd

DESCRIPTION
     ocspd performs caching and network fetching of Certificate Revocation Lists
     (CRLs) and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responses. It is used
     by Security.framework during certificate verification. Security.framework
     communicates with ocspd via a private RPC interface. When
     Security.framework determines that a CRL is needed, or that it needs to
     perform an OCSP transaction, it performs an RPC to ocspd which then
     examines its cache to see if the appropriate CRL or OCSP response exists
     and is still valid. If so, that entity is returned to Security.framework.
     If no entry is found in cache, ocspd obtains it from the network, saving
     the result in cache before returning it to Security.framework.

     This command is not intended to be invoked directly.
