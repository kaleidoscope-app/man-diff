uuconv(1)                    General Commands Manual                   uuconv(1)



NAME
       uuconv - convert UUCP configuration files

SYNOPSIS
       uuconv -i type -o type [-p program] [--program program]

       uuconv --input type --output type [-p program] [--program program]

DESCRIPTION
       The uuconv program can be used to convert UUCP configuration files from
       one format to another.  This can be useful for administrators converting
       from an older UUCP package.  Taylor UUCP is able to read and use old
       configuration file formats, but some new features can not be selected
       using the old formats.

       The type of configuration file to read is specified using the -i or
       --input options.  The type of  configuration file to write is specified
       using the -o or --output options.

       The supported configuration file types are taylor, v2, and hdb.  For a
       description of the taylor configuration files, use the info command and
       see "*Note Configuration Files::" for uucp.  The other types of
       configuration files are used by traditional UUCP packages, and are not
       described in this manual.

       An input configuration of type taylor is read  from  a compiled in
       directory by default.

       The output configuration is written to files in the directory in which
       uuconv is run.

       Some information in the input files may not be representable in the
       desired output format, in which case uuconv will silently discard it.
       The output of uuconv should be carefully checked before it is used.  The
       uuchk(8) program may be used for this purpose.

       The -p or --program option may be used to convert specific cu
       configuration information, rather than the default of only converting the
       uucp configuration information.

OPTIONS
       -i, --input
            Set input type (one of taylor, v2, hdb)

       -o, --output
            Set output type (one of taylor, v2, hdb)

       -p, --program
            Program to convert (e.g., uucp or cu)

       Standard UUCP options: -v, --version Report version information and exit.

       --help
            Print a help message and exit.
