RI(1)                 1 (ruby programmer's reference guide)                RI(1)

NAME
     ri – Ruby API reference front end

SYNOPSIS
     ri [-ahilTv] [-d DIRNAME] [-f FORMAT] [-w WIDTH] [--[no-]pager]
        [--server[=PORT]] [--[no-]list-doc-dirs] [--no-standard-docs]
        [--[no-]{system|site|gems|home}] [--[no-]profile] [--dump=CACHE]
        [name ...]

DESCRIPTION
     ri is a command-line front end for the Ruby API reference.  You can search
     and read the API reference for classes and methods with ri.

     ri is a part of Ruby.

     name can be:

           Class | Module | Module::Class
           Class::method | Class#method | Class.method | method
           gem_name: | gem_name:README | gem_name:History

     All class names may be abbreviated to their minimum unambiguous form.  If a
     name is ambiguous, all valid options will be listed.

     A ‘.’ matches either class or instance methods, while #method matches only
     instance and ::method matches only class methods.

     README and other files may be displayed by prefixing them with the gem name
     they're contained in.  If the gem name is followed by a ‘:’ all files in
     the gem will be shown.  The file name extension may be omitted where it is
     unambiguous.

     For example:

           ri Fil
           ri File
           ri File.new
           ri zip
           ri rdoc:README

     Note that shell quoting or escaping may be required for method names
     containing punctuation:

           ri 'Array.[]'
           ri compact\!

     To see the default directories ri will search, run:

           ri --list-doc-dirs

     Specifying the --system, --site, --home, --gems, or --doc-dir options will
     limit ri to searching only the specified directories.

     ri options may be set in the RI environment variable.

     The ri pager can be set with the RI_PAGER environment variable or the PAGER
     environment variable.
