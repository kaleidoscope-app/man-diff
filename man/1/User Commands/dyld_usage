DYLD_USAGE(1)                         dyld                         DYLD_USAGE(1)



NAME
       dyld_usage - report dynamic linker activity in real-time

SYNOPSIS
       dyld_usage [-e] [-f mode] [-j] [-h] [-t seconds] [-R rawfile [-S
       start_time] [-E end_time]] [pid | cmd [pid | cmd] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The dyld_usage utility presents an ongoing display of information
       pertaining to dynamic linker activity within one or more processes. It
       requires root privileges due to the kernel tracing facility it uses to
       operate. By default dyld_usage monitors dyld activity in all processes
       except the running dyld_usage process, Terminal, telnetd, sshd, rlogind,
       tcsh, csh, and sh. These defaults can be overridden such that output is
       limited to include or exclude a list of processes specified on the
       command line.  Processes may be specified either by file name or by
       process id.

       The output of dyld_usage is formatted according to the size of your
       window. A narrow window will display fewer columns of data. Use a wide
       window for maximum data display.

OPTIONS
       dyld_usage supports the following options:

       -e     Exclude the specified list of pids and commands from the sample,
              and exclude dyld_usage by default.

              -j

              Display output in JSON format.

       -h     Display usage information and exit.

       -R     Specify a raw trace file to process.

       -t     Specify timeout in seconds (for use in automated tools).

DISPLAY
       The data columns displayed are as follows:

          TIMESTAMP
                 Time of day when call occurred.

          OPERATION
                 The dyld operation triggered by the process. Typically these
                 operations are triggered by process launch or via a dlopen or
                 dlsym system call. System call entries include both the
                 parameters to the system call and the system call's return code
                 (e.g., 0 on success).

          TIME INTERVAL
                 The elapsed time spent in the dynamic linker operation or
                 system call.

          PROCESS NAME
                 The process that generated the dynamic linker activity. If
                 space allows, the thread id will be appended to the process
                 name (i.e., Mail.nnn).

SAMPLE USAGE
          sudo dyld_usage Mail

          dyld_usage will display dynamic link operations for all instances of
          processes named Mail.
