NAME
       topsyscall - top syscalls by syscall name. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       topsyscall [-Cs] [interval [count]]

DESCRIPTION
       This program continually prints a report of the top system calls, and
       refreshes the display every 1 second or as specified at the command line.

       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.
