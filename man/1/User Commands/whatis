NAME
     man, apropos, whatis – display online manual documentation pages

SYNOPSIS
     man [-adho] [-t | -w] [-M manpath] [-P pager] [-S mansect]
         [-m arch[:machine]] [-p [eprtv]] [mansect] page ...

     man -f [-d] [-M manpath] [-P pager] [-S mansect] keyword ...
     whatis [-d] [-s mansect] keyword ...

     man -k [-d] [-M manpath] [-P pager] [-S mansect] keyword ...
     apropos [-d] [-s mansect] keyword ...

DESCRIPTION
     The man utility finds and displays online manual documentation pages.  If
     mansect is provided, man restricts the search to the specific section of
     the manual.

     The sections of the manual are:
           1.   General Commands Manual
           2.   System Calls Manual
           3.   Library Functions Manual
           4.   Kernel Interfaces Manual
           5.   File Formats Manual
           6.   Games Manual
           7.   Miscellaneous Information Manual
           8.   System Manager's Manual
           9.   Kernel Developer's Manual

     Options that man understands:

     -M manpath
             Forces a specific colon separated manual path instead of the
             default search path.  See manpath(1).  Overrides the MANPATH
             environment variable.

     -P pager
             Use specified pager.  Defaults to “less -sR” if color support is
             enabled, or “less -s”.  Overrides the MANPAGER environment
             variable, which in turn overrides the PAGER environment variable.

     -S mansect
             Restricts manual sections searched to the specified colon delimited
             list.  Defaults to “1:8:2:3:3lua:n:4:5:6:7:9:l”.  Overrides the
             MANSECT environment variable.

     -a      Display all manual pages instead of just the first found for each
             page argument.

     -d      Print extra debugging information.  Repeat for increased verbosity.
             Does not display the manual page.

     -f      Emulate whatis(1).  Note that only a subset of options will have
             any effect when man is invoked in this mode.  See the below
             description of whatis options for details.

     -h      Display short help message and exit.

     -k      Emulate apropos(1).  Note that only a subset of options will have
             any effect when man is invoked in this mode.  See the below
             description of apropos options for details.

     -m arch[:machine]
             Override the default architecture and machine settings allowing
             lookup of other platform specific manual pages.  This option is
             accepted, but not implemented, on macOS.

     -o      Force use of non-localized manual pages.  See IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
             for how locale specific searches work.  Overrides the LC_ALL,
             LC_CTYPE, and LANG environment variables.

     -p [eprtv]
             Use the list of given preprocessors before running nroff(1) or
             troff(1).  Valid preprocessors arguments:

             e       eqn(1)
             p       pic(1)
             r       refer(1)
             t       tbl(1)
             v       vgrind(1)

             Overrides the MANROFFSEQ environment variable.

     -t      Send manual page source through troff(1) allowing transformation of
             the manual pages to other formats.

     -w      Display the location of the manual page instead of the contents of
             the manual page.

     Options that apropos and whatis understand:

     -d      Same as the -d option for man.

     -s      Same as the -S option for man.

     When man is operated in apropos or whatis emulation mode, only a subset of
     its options will be honored.  Specifically, -d, -M, -P, and -S have
     equivalent functionality in the apropos and whatis implementation provided.
     The MANPATH, MANSECT, and MANPAGER environment variables will similarly be
     honored.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
   Locale Specific Searches
     The man utility supports manual pages in different locales.  The search
     behavior is dictated by the first of three environment variables with a
     nonempty string: LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or LANG.  If set, man will search for
     locale specific manual pages using the following logic:

           lang_country.charset
           lang.charset
           en.charset

     For example, if LC_ALL is set to “ja_JP.eucJP”, man will search the
     following paths when considering section 1 manual pages in /usr/share/man:

           /usr/share/man/ja_JP.eucJP/man1
           /usr/share/man/ja.eucJP/man1
           /usr/share/man/en.eucJP/man1
           /usr/share/man/man1

   Displaying Specific Manual Files
     The man utility also supports displaying a specific manual page if passed a
     path to the file as long as it contains a ‘/’ character.

ENVIRONMENT
     The following environment variables affect the execution of man:

     LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG
                     Used to find locale specific manual pages.  Valid values
                     can be found by running the locale(1) command.  See
                     IMPLEMENTATION NOTES for details.  Influenced by the -o
                     option.

     MACHINE_ARCH, MACHINE
                     Used to find platform specific manual pages.  If unset, the
                     output of “sysctl hw.machine_arch” and “sysctl hw.machine”
                     is used respectively.  See IMPLEMENTATION NOTES for
                     details.  Corresponds to the -m option.

     MANPATH         The standard search path used by man(1) may be changed by
                     specifying a path in the MANPATH environment variable.
                     Invalid paths, or paths without manual databases, are
                     ignored.  Overridden by -M.  If MANPATH begins with a
                     colon, it is appended to the default list; if it ends with
                     a colon, it is prepended to the default list; or if it
                     contains two adjacent colons, the standard search path is
                     inserted between the colons.  If none of these conditions
                     are met, it overrides the standard search path.

     MANROFFSEQ      Used to determine the preprocessors for the manual source
                     before running nroff(1) or troff(1).  If unset, defaults to
                     tbl(1).  Corresponds to the -p option.

     MANSECT         Restricts manual sections searched to the specified colon
                     delimited list.  Corresponds to the -S option.

     MANWIDTH        If set to a numeric value, used as the width manpages
                     should be displayed.  Otherwise, if set to a special value
                     “tty”, and output is to a terminal, the pages may be
                     displayed over the whole width of the screen.

     MANCOLOR        If set, enables color support.

     MANPAGER        Program used to display files.

                     If unset, and color support is enabled, “less -sR” is used.

                     If unset, and color support is disabled, then PAGER is
                     used.  If that has no value either, “less -s” is used.

FILES
     /etc/man.conf
             System configuration file.
     /usr/local/etc/man.d/*.conf
             Local configuration files.

EXIT STATUS
     The man utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Show the manual page for stat(2):

           $ man 2 stat

     Show all manual pages for ‘stat’.

           $ man -a stat

     List manual pages which match the regular expression either in the title or
     in the body:

           $ man -k '\<copy\>.*archive'

     Show the manual page for ls(1) and use cat(1) as pager:

           $ man -P cat ls

     Show the location of the ls(1) manual page:

           $ man -w ls
