SHASUM(1)               Perl Programmers Reference Guide               SHASUM(1)




NAME
       shasum - Print or Check SHA Checksums

SYNOPSIS
        Usage: shasum [OPTION]... [FILE]...
        Print or check SHA checksums.
        With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

          -a, --algorithm   1 (default), 224, 256, 384, 512, 512224, 512256
          -b, --binary      read in binary mode
          -c, --check       read SHA sums from the FILEs and check them
              --tag         create a BSD-style checksum
          -t, --text        read in text mode (default)
          -U, --UNIVERSAL   read in Universal Newlines mode
                                produces same digest on Windows/Unix/Mac
          -0, --01          read in BITS mode
                                ASCII '0' interpreted as 0-bit,
                                ASCII '1' interpreted as 1-bit,
                                all other characters ignored

        The following five options are useful only when verifying checksums:
              --ignore-missing  don't fail or report status for missing files
          -q, --quiet           don't print OK for each successfully verified file
          -s, --status          don't output anything, status code shows success
              --strict          exit non-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines
          -w, --warn            warn about improperly formatted checksum lines

          -h, --help        display this help and exit
          -v, --version     output version information and exit

        When verifying SHA-512/224 or SHA-512/256 checksums, indicate the
        algorithm explicitly using the -a option, e.g.

          shasum -a 512224 -c checksumfile

        The sums are computed as described in FIPS PUB 180-4.  When checking,
        the input should be a former output of this program.  The default
        mode is to print a line with checksum, a character indicating type
        (`*' for binary, ` ' for text, `U' for UNIVERSAL, `^' for BITS),
        and name for each FILE.  The line starts with a `\' character if the
        FILE name contains either newlines or backslashes, which are then
        replaced by the two-character sequences `\n' and `\\' respectively.

DESCRIPTION
       Running shasum is often the quickest way to compute SHA message digests.
       The user simply feeds data to the script through files or standard input,
       and then collects the results from standard output.

       The following command shows how to compute digests for typical inputs
       such as the NIST test vector "abc":

               perl -e "print qq(abc)" | shasum

       Or, if you want to use SHA-256 instead of the default SHA-1, simply say:

               perl -e "print qq(abc)" | shasum -a 256

       Since shasum mimics the behavior of the combined GNU sha1sum, sha224sum,
       sha256sum, sha384sum, and sha512sum programs, you can install this script
       as a convenient drop-in replacement.

       Unlike the GNU programs, shasum encompasses the full SHA standard by
       allowing partial-byte inputs.  This is accomplished through the BITS
       option (-0).  The following example computes the SHA-224 digest of the
       7-bit message 0001100:

               perl -e "print qq(0001100)" | shasum -0 -a 224
