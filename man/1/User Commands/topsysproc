topsysproc(1m)                    USER COMMANDS                   topsysproc(1m)



NAME
       topsysproc - top syscalls by process name. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       topsysproc [-Cs] [interval [count]]

DESCRIPTION
       This program continually prints a report of the number of system calls by
       process name, and refreshes the display every 1 second or as specified at
       the command line. Similar data can be fetched with "prstat -m".

       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

       -s     print per second values

EXAMPLES
       Default output, 1 second updates,
              # topsysproc

       Print every 5 seconds,
              # topsysproc 5

       Print a scrolling output,
              # topsysproc -C
