mdimport(1)                  General Commands Manual                 mdimport(1)

NAME
     mdimport â€“ import file hierarchies into the metadata datastore.

SYNOPSIS
     mdimport [-itpAXLr] [-d level] [-o -outputfile] [ file | directory ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     mdimport is used to test Spotlight plug-ins, list the installed plug-ins
     and schema, and re-index files handled by a plug-in when a new plug-in is
     installed.

     The following options are available:

     -i          Request Spotlight to import file or recursively import
                 directory.  The files will be imported using the normal
                 mechanisms and attributes will be stored in the Spotlight
                 index. This is the implied switch if none are specified.

     -t          Request Spotlight to test import file, sending the result back
                 to mdimport for possible further processing. The attributes
                 will not be stored in the Spotlight index. This is useful to
                 test Spotlight import plug-ins.

     -d level    Print debugging information.  This requires -t.


     -d1
                 print summary of test import

     -d2
                 print summary of import and all attributes, except kMDItemTextContent

     -d3
                 print summary of import and all attributes

     -o outfile
                 Store attribute into
                 outfile.
                 This requires
                 -t.

     -p
                 Print out performance information gathered during the run.  This requires
                 -t.

     -A
                 Print out the list of all of the attributes and their
                 localizations in the current language and exit.

     -X
                 Print the schema file and exit.

     -L
                 Print the list of installed importers and exit.

     -r
                 Ask the server to reimport files for UTIs claimed by the listed plugin.
                 For example, the following would cause all of the chat files on the system to be reimported:

                       mdimport -r /System/Library/Spotlight/Chat.mdimporter

NOTES
     -f is obsolete in Leopard and beyond.
