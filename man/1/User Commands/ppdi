NAME
       ppdi - import ppd files (deprecated)

SYNOPSIS
       ppdi [ -I include-directory ] [ -o source-file ] ppd-file [ ...  ppd-file
       ]

DESCRIPTION
       ppdi imports one or more PPD files into a PPD compiler source file.
       Multiple languages of the same PPD file are merged into a single printer
       definition to facilitate accurate changes for all localizations.  This
       program is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of CUPS.

OPTIONS
       ppdi supports the following options:

       -I include-directory
            Specifies an alternate include directory.  Multiple -I options can
            be supplied to add additional directories.

       -o source-file
            Specifies the PPD source file to update.  If the source file does
            not exist, a new source file is created.  Otherwise the existing
            file is merged with the new PPD file(s) on the command-line.  If no
            source file is specified, the filename ppdi.drv is used.

NOTES
       PPD files are deprecated and will no longer be supported in a future
       feature release of CUPS.  Printers that do not support IPP can be
       supported using applications such as ippeveprinter(1).
