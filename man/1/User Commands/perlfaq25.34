PERLFAQ2(1)             Perl Programmers Reference Guide             PERLFAQ2(1)




NAME
       perlfaq2 - Obtaining and Learning about Perl

VERSION
       version 5.20210411

DESCRIPTION
       This section of the FAQ answers questions about where to find source and
       documentation for Perl, support, and related matters.

   What machines support Perl? Where do I get it?
       The standard release of Perl (the one maintained by the Perl development
       team) is distributed only in source code form. You can find the latest
       releases at <http://www.cpan.org/src/>.

       Perl builds and runs on a bewildering number of platforms. Virtually all
       known and current Unix derivatives are supported (perl's native
       platform), as are other systems like VMS, DOS, OS/2, Windows, QNX, BeOS,
       OS X, MPE/iX and the Amiga.

       Binary distributions for some proprietary platforms can be found
       <http://www.cpan.org/ports/> directory. Because these are not part of the
       standard distribution, they may and in fact do differ from the base perl
       port in a variety of ways. You'll have to check their respective release
       notes to see just what the differences are. These differences can be
       either positive (e.g. extensions for the features of the particular
       platform that are not supported in the source release of perl) or
       negative (e.g. might be based upon a less current source release of
       perl).

   How can I get a binary version of Perl?
       See CPAN Ports <http://www.cpan.org/ports/>

   I don't have a C compiler. How can I build my own Perl interpreter?
       For Windows, use a binary version of Perl, Strawberry Perl
       <http://strawberryperl.com/> and ActivePerl
       <http://www.activestate.com/activeperl> come with a bundled C compiler.

       Otherwise if you really do want to build Perl, you need to get a binary
       version of "gcc" for your system first. Use a search engine to find out
       how to do this for your operating system.

   I copied the Perl binary from one machine to another, but scripts don't work.
       That's probably because you forgot libraries, or library paths differ.
       You really should build the whole distribution on the machine it will
       eventually live on, and then type "make install". Most other approaches
       are doomed to failure.

       One simple way to check that things are in the right place is to print
       out the hard-coded @INC that perl looks through for libraries:

           % perl -le 'print for @INC'

       If this command lists any paths that don't exist on your system, then you
       may need to move the appropriate libraries to these locations, or create
       symbolic links, aliases, or shortcuts appropriately. @INC is also printed
       as part of the output of

           % perl -V

       You might also want to check out "How do I keep my own module/library
       directory?" in perlfaq8.

   I grabbed the sources and tried to compile but gdbm/dynamic
       loading/malloc/linking/... failed. How do I make it work?
       Read the INSTALL file, which is part of the source distribution.  It
       describes in detail how to cope with most idiosyncrasies that the
       "Configure" script can't work around for any given system or
       architecture.

   What modules and extensions are available for Perl? What is CPAN?
       CPAN stands for Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, a multi-gigabyte
       archive replicated on hundreds of machines all over the world. CPAN
       contains tens of thousands of modules and extensions, source code and
       documentation, designed for everything from commercial database
       interfaces to keyboard/screen control and running large web sites.

       You can search CPAN on <http://metacpan.org>.

       The master web site for CPAN is <http://www.cpan.org/>,
       <http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html> lists all mirrors.

       See the CPAN FAQ at <http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html> for answers
       to the most frequently asked questions about CPAN.

       The Task::Kensho module has a list of recommended modules which you
       should review as a good starting point.

   Where can I get information on Perl?
       •   <http://www.perl.org/>

       •   <http://perldoc.perl.org/>

       •   <http://learn.perl.org/>

       The complete Perl documentation is available with the Perl distribution.
       If you have Perl installed locally, you probably have the documentation
       installed as well: type "perldoc perl" in a terminal or view online
       <http://perldoc.perl.org/perl.html>.

       (Some operating system distributions may ship the documentation in a
       different package; for instance, on Debian, you need to install the
       "perl-doc" package.)

       Many good books have been written about Perl--see the section later in
       perlfaq2 for more details.

   What is perl.com? Perl Mongers? pm.org? perl.org? cpan.org?
       Perl.com <http://www.perl.com/> used to be part of the O'Reilly Network,
       a subsidiary of O'Reilly Media. Although it retains most of the original
       content from its O'Reilly Network, it is now hosted by The Perl
       Foundation <http://www.perlfoundation.org/>.

       The Perl Foundation is an advocacy organization for the Perl language
       which maintains the web site <http://www.perl.org/> as a general advocacy
       site for the Perl language. It uses the domain to provide general support
       services to the Perl community, including the hosting of mailing lists,
       web sites, and other services. There are also many other sub-domains for
       special topics like learning Perl and jobs in Perl, such as:

       •   <http://www.perl.org/>

       •   <http://learn.perl.org/>

       •   <http://jobs.perl.org/>

       •   <http://lists.perl.org/>

       Perl Mongers <http://www.pm.org/> uses the pm.org domain for services
       related to local Perl user groups, including the hosting of mailing lists
       and web sites. See the Perl Mongers web site <http://www.pm.org/> for
       more information about joining, starting, or requesting services for a
       Perl user group.

       CPAN, or the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network <http://www.cpan.org/>,
       is a replicated, worldwide repository of Perl software.  See What is
       CPAN?.

   Where can I post questions?
       There are many Perl mailing lists for various topics, specifically the
       beginners list <http://lists.perl.org/list/beginners.html> may be of use.

       Other places to ask questions are on the PerlMonks site
       <http://www.perlmonks.org/> or stackoverflow
       <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/perl>.

   Perl Books
       There are many good books on Perl
       <http://www.perl.org/books/library.html>.

   Which magazines have Perl content?
       There's also $foo Magazin, a German magazine dedicated to Perl, at (
       <http://www.foo-magazin.de> ). The Perl-Zeitung is another German-
       speaking magazine for Perl beginners (see <http://perl-zeitung.at.tf> ).

       Several Unix/Linux related magazines frequently include articles on Perl.

   Which Perl blogs should I read?
       Perl News <http://perlnews.org/> covers some of the major events in the
       Perl world, Perl Weekly <http://perlweekly.com/> is a weekly e-mail (and
       RSS feed) of hand-picked Perl articles.

       <http://blogs.perl.org/> hosts many Perl blogs, there are also several
       blog aggregators: Perlsphere <http://perlsphere.net/> and IronMan
       <http://ironman.enlightenedperl.org/> are two of them.

   What mailing lists are there for Perl?
       A comprehensive list of Perl-related mailing lists can be found at
       <http://lists.perl.org/>

   Where can I buy a commercial version of Perl?
       Perl already is commercial software: it has a license that you can grab
       and carefully read to your manager. It is distributed in releases and
       comes in well-defined packages. There is a very large and supportive user
       community and an extensive literature.

       If you still need commercial support ActiveState
       <http://www.activestate.com/activeperl> offers this.

   Where do I send bug reports?
       (contributed by brian d foy)

       First, ensure that you've found an actual bug. Second, ensure you've
       found an actual bug.

       If you've found a bug with the perl interpreter or one of the modules in
       the standard library (those that come with Perl), you can submit a bug
       report to the GitHub issue tracker at
       <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.

       To determine if a module came with your version of Perl, you can install
       and use the Module::CoreList module. It has the information about the
       modules (with their versions) included with each release of Perl.

       Every CPAN module has a bug tracker set up in RT, <http://rt.cpan.org>.
       You can submit bugs to RT either through its web interface or by email.
       To email a bug report, send it to bug-<distribution-name>@rt.cpan.org .
       For example, if you wanted to report a bug in Business::ISBN, you could
       send a message to bug-Business-ISBN@rt.cpan.org .

       Some modules might have special reporting requirements, such as a GitHub
       or Google Code tracking system, so you should check the module
       documentation too.
