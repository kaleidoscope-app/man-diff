DEMANDOC(1)                  General Commands Manual                 DEMANDOC(1)

NAME
     demandoc â€“ emit only text of UNIX manuals

SYNOPSIS
     demandoc [-w] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The demandoc utility emits only the text portions of well-formed mdoc(7)
     and man(7) UNIX manual files.

     By default, demandoc parses standard input and outputs only text nodes,
     preserving line and column position.  Escape sequences are omitted from the
     output.

     Its arguments are as follows:

     -w      Output a word list.  This outputs each word of text on its own
             line.  A "word", in this case, refers to whitespace-delimited terms
             beginning with at least two letters and not consisting of any
             escape sequences.  Words have their leading and trailing
             punctuation (double-quotes, sentence punctuation, etc.) stripped.

     file ...
             The input files.

     If a document is not well-formed, it is skipped.

     The -i, -k, -m, and -p flags are silently discarded for calling
     compatibility with the historical deroff.

EXIT STATUS
     The demandoc utility exits with one of the following values:

     0       No errors occurred.
     6       An operating system error occurred, for example memory exhaustion
             or an error accessing input files.  Such errors cause demandoc to
             exit at once, possibly in the middle of parsing or formatting a
             file.  The output databases are corrupt and should be removed .

EXAMPLES
     The traditional usage of demandoc is for spell-checking manuals on BSD.
     This is accomplished as follows (assuming British spelling):

           $ demandoc -w file.1 | spell -b

SEE ALSO
     mandoc(1), man(7), mdoc(7)

HISTORY
     demandoc replaces the historical deroff utility for handling modern man(7)
     and mdoc(7) documents.
