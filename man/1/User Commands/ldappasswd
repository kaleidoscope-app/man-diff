DESCRIPTION
       ldappasswd is a tool to set the password of an LDAP user.  ldappasswd
       uses the LDAPv3 Password Modify (RFC 3062) extended operation.

       ldappasswd sets the password of associated with the user [or an
       optionally specified user].  If the new password is not specified on the
       command line and the user doesn't enable prompting, the server will be
       asked to generate a password for the user.

       ldappasswd is neither designed nor intended to be a replacement for
       passwd(1) and should not be installed as such.

OPTIONS
       -A     Prompt for old password.  This is used instead of specifying the
              password on the command line.

       -a_oldPasswd
              Set the old password to oldPasswd.

       -t_oldPasswdFile
              Set the old password to the contents of oldPasswdFile.

       -x     Use simple authentication instead of SASL.

       -D_binddn
              Use the Distinguished Name binddn to bind to the LDAP directory.
              For SASL binds, the server is expected to ignore this value.

       -d_debuglevel
              Set the LDAP debugging level to debuglevel.  ldappasswd must be
              compiled with LDAP_DEBUG defined for this option to have any
              effect.

       -H_ldapuri
              Specify URI(s) referring to the ldap server(s); only the
              protocol/host/port fields are allowed; a list of URI, separated by
              whitespace or commas is expected.

       -h_ldaphost
              Specify an alternate host on which the ldap server is running.
              Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -p_ldapport
              Specify an alternate TCP port where the ldap server is listening.
              Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -n     Do not set password. (Can be useful when used in conjunction with
              -v or -d)

       -S     Prompt for new password.  This is used instead of specifying the
              password on the command line.

       -s_newPasswd
              Set the new password to newPasswd.

       -T_newPasswdFile
              Set the new password to the contents of newPasswdFile.

       -v     Increase the verbosity of output.  Can be specified multiple
              times.

       -W     Prompt for bind password.  This is used instead of specifying the
              password on the command line.

       -w_passwd
              Use passwd as the password to bind with.

       -y_passwdfile
              Use complete contents of passwdfile as the password for simple
              authentication.

       -O_security-properties
              Specify SASL security properties.

       -I     Enable SASL Interactive mode.  Always prompt.  Default is to
              prompt only as needed.

       -Q     Enable SASL Quiet mode.  Never prompt.

       -U_authcid
              Specify the authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of the ID
              depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -R_realm
              Specify the realm of authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of
              the realm depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -X_authzid
              Specify the requested authorization ID for SASL bind.  authzid
              must be one of the following formats: dn:<distinguished name> or
              u:<username>.

       -Y_mech
              Specify the SASL mechanism to be used for authentication. If it's
              not specified, the program will choose the best mechanism the
              server knows.

       -Z[Z]  Issue StartTLS (Transport Layer Security) extended operation. If
              you use -ZZ, the command will require the operation to be
              successful
