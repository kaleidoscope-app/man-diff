DESCRIPTION
       lp submits files for printing or alters a pending job.  Use a filename of
       "-" to force printing from the standard input.

   THE DEFAULT DESTINATION
       CUPS provides many ways to set the default destination. The LPDEST and
       PRINTER environment variables are consulted first.  If neither are set,
       the current default set using the lpoptions(1) command is used, followed
       by the default set using the lpadmin(8) command.

OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized by lp:

       --   Marks the end of options; use this to print a file whose name begins
            with a dash (-).

       -E   Forces encryption when connecting to the server.

       -U username
            Specifies the username to use when connecting to the server.

       -c   This option is provided for backwards-compatibility only. On systems
            that support it, this option forces the print file to be copied to
            the spool directory before printing.  In CUPS, print files are
            always sent to the scheduler via IPP which has the same effect.

       -d destination
            Prints files to the named printer.

       -h hostname[:port]
            Chooses an alternate server.

       -i job-id
            Specifies an existing job to modify.

       -m   Sends an email when the job is completed.

       -n copies
            Sets the number of copies to print.

       -o "name=value [ ... name=value ]"
            Sets one or more job options.  See "COMMON JOB OPTIONS" below.

       -q priority
            Sets the job priority from 1 (lowest) to 100 (highest).  The default
            priority is 50.

       -s   Do not report the resulting job IDs (silent mode.)

       -t "name"
            Sets the job name.

       -H hh:mm

       -H hold

       -H immediate

       -H restart

       -H resume
            Specifies when the job should be printed.  A value of immediate will
            print the file immediately, a value of hold will hold the job
            indefinitely, and a UTC time value (HH:MM) will hold the job until
            the specified UTC (not local) time.  Use a value of resume with the
            -i option to resume a held job.  Use a value of restart with the -i
            option to restart a completed job.

       -P page-list
            Specifies which pages to print in the document.  The list can
            contain a list of numbers and ranges (#-#) separated by commas,
            e.g., "1,3-5,16".  The page numbers refer to the output pages and
            not the document's original pages - options like "number-up" can
            affect the numbering of the pages.

   COMMON JOB OPTIONS
       Aside from the printer-specific options reported by the lpoptions(1)
       command, the following generic options are available:

       -o job-sheets=name
            Prints a cover page (banner) with the document.  The "name" can be
            "classified", "confidential", "secret", "standard", "topsecret", or
            "unclassified".

       -o media=size
            Sets the page size to size. Most printers support at least the size
            names "a4", "letter", and "legal".

       -o number-up={2|4|6|9|16}
            Prints 2, 4, 6, 9, or 16 document (input) pages on each output page.

       -o orientation-requested=4
            Prints the job in landscape (rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise).

       -o orientation-requested=5
            Prints the job in landscape (rotated 90 degrees clockwise).

       -o orientation-requested=6
            Prints the job in reverse portrait (rotated 180 degrees).

       -o print-quality=3

       -o print-quality=4

       -o print-quality=5
            Specifies the output quality - draft (3), normal (4), or best (5).

       -o sides=one-sided
            Prints on one side of the paper.

       -o sides=two-sided-long-edge
            Prints on both sides of the paper for portrait output.

       -o sides=two-sided-short-edge
            Prints on both sides of the paper for landscape output.

CONFORMING TO
       Unlike the System V printing system, CUPS allows printer names to contain
       any printable character except SPACE, TAB, "/", or "#".  Also, printer
       and class names are not case-sensitive.

       The -q option accepts a different range of values than the Solaris lp
       command, matching the IPP job priority values (1-100, 100 is highest
       priority) instead of the Solaris values (0-39, 0 is highest priority).

EXAMPLES
       Print two copies of a document to the default printer:

           lp -n 2 filename

       Print a double-sided legal document to a printer called "foo":

           lp -d foo -o media=legal -o sides=two-sided-long-edge filename

       Print a presentation document 2-up to a printer called "bar":

           lp -d bar -o number-up=2 filename
