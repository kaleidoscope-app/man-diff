POSTALIAS(1)                 General Commands Manual                POSTALIAS(1)




NAME
       postalias - Postfix alias database maintenance

SYNOPSIS
       postalias [-Nfinoprsuvw] [-c config_dir] [-d key] [-q key]
               [file_type:]file_name ...

DESCRIPTION
       The postalias(1) command creates or queries one or more Postfix alias
       databases, or updates an existing one. The input and output file formats
       are expected to be compatible with Sendmail version 8, and are expected
       to be suitable for the use as NIS alias maps.

       If the result files do not exist they will be created with the same group
       and other read permissions as their source file.

       While a database update is in progress, signal delivery is postponed, and
       an exclusive, advisory, lock is placed on the entire database, in order
       to avoid surprises in spectator processes.

       The format of Postfix alias input files is described in aliases(5).

       By default the lookup key is mapped to lowercase to make the lookups case
       insensitive; as of Postfix 2.3 this case folding happens only with tables
       whose lookup keys are fixed-case strings such as btree:, dbm: or hash:.
       With earlier versions, the lookup key is folded even with tables where a
       lookup field can match both upper and lower case text, such as regexp:
       and pcre:. This resulted in loss of information with $number
       substitutions.

       Options:

       -c config_dir
              Read the main.cf configuration file in the named directory instead
              of the default configuration directory.

       -d key Search the specified maps for key and remove one entry per map.
              The exit status is zero when the requested information was found.

              If a key value of - is specified, the program reads key values
              from the standard input stream. The exit status is zero when at
              least one of the requested keys was found.

       -f     Do not fold the lookup key to lower case while creating or
              querying a table.

              With Postfix version 2.3 and later, this option has no effect for
              regular expression tables. There, case folding is controlled by
              appending a flag to a pattern.

       -i     Incremental mode. Read entries from standard input and do not
              truncate an existing database. By default, postalias(1) creates a
              new database from the entries in file_name.

       -N     Include the terminating null character that terminates lookup keys
              and values. By default, postalias(1) does whatever is the default
              for the host operating system.

       -n     Don't include the terminating null character that terminates
              lookup keys and values. By default, postalias(1) does whatever is
              the default for the host operating system.

       -o     Do not release root privileges when processing a non-root input
              file. By default, postalias(1) drops root privileges and runs as
              the source file owner instead.

       -p     Do not inherit the file access permissions from the input file
              when creating a new file.  Instead, create a new file with default
              access permissions (mode 0644).

       -q key Search the specified maps for key and write the first value found
              to the standard output stream. The exit status is zero when the
              requested information was found.

              If a key value of - is specified, the program reads key values
              from the standard input stream and writes one line of key: value
              output for each key that was found. The exit status is zero when
              at least one of the requested keys was found.

       -r     When updating a table, do not complain about attempts to update
              existing entries, and make those updates anyway.

       -s     Retrieve all database elements, and write one line of key: value
              output for each element. The elements are printed in database
              order, which is not necessarily the same as the original input
              order.  This feature is available in Postfix version 2.2 and
              later, and is not available for all database types.

       -u     Disable UTF-8 support. UTF-8 support is enabled by default when
              "smtputf8_enable = yes". It requires that keys and values are
              valid UTF-8 strings.

       -v     Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple -v options
              make the software increasingly verbose.

       -w     When updating a table, do not complain about attempts to update
              existing entries, and ignore those attempts.

       Arguments:

       file_type
              The database type. To find out what types are supported, use the
              "postconf -m" command.

              The postalias(1) command can query any supported file type, but it
              can create only the following file types:

              btree  The output is a btree file, named file_name.db.  This is
                     available on systems with support for db databases.

              cdb    The output is one file named file_name.cdb.  This is
                     available on systems with support for cdb databases.

              dbm    The output consists of two files, named file_name.pag and
                     file_name.dir.  This is available on systems with support
                     for dbm databases.

              hash   The output is a hashed file, named file_name.db.  This is
                     available on systems with support for db databases.

              fail   A table that reliably fails all requests. The lookup table
                     name is used for logging only. This table exists to
                     simplify Postfix error tests.

              sdbm   The output consists of two files, named file_name.pag and
                     file_name.dir.  This is available on systems with support
                     for sdbm databases.

              When no file_type is specified, the software uses the database
              type specified via the default_database_type configuration
              parameter.  The default value for this parameter depends on the
              host environment.

       file_name
              The name of the alias database source file when creating a
              database.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Problems are logged to the standard error stream and to syslogd(8).  No
       output means that no problems were detected. Duplicate entries are
       skipped and are flagged with a warning.

       postalias(1) terminates with zero exit status in case of success
       (including successful "postalias -q" lookup) and terminates with non-zero
       exit status in case of failure.
