NAME
     createhomedir â€“ create and populate home directories on the local computer.

SYNOPSIS
     createhomedir [-scbalh] [-n directoryDomainName] [-u username]

DESCRIPTION
     createhomedir provides several options for creating and populating home
     directories.

OPTIONS
     -s       creates home directories for server home paths only (default).

     -c       creates home directories for local home paths only.

     -b       creates home directories for both server and local home paths.

     -a       creates home directories for users defined in all directory
              domains of the server's search path.

     -l       creates home directories for users defined in the local directory
              domain.

     -L       causes the created home directory to be localized.

     -n directoryDomainName
              creates home directories for users defined in a specific directory
              domain in the server's search path.

     -u username
              creates a home directory for a specific user defined in the
              domain(s) identified in the -a, -l, or -n parameter. If you omit
              the -a, -l, and -n parameters when you use the -u parameter, -a is
              assumed.

     -i       reads username list from standard input and creates specified home
              directories. Each username should be on its own line.

     -h       usage help.

FILES
     /usr/sbin/createhomedir                       location of tool

CAVEATS
     When using the -a option, search limits of various directory servers (such
     as Open Directory or Active Directory) can prevent all possible home
     directories from being created. In this case, you may need to specify the
     usernames explicitly.
