DESCRIPTION
       ippeveprinter is a simple Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) server
       conforming to the IPP Everywhere (PWG 5100.14) specification. It can be
       used to test client software or act as a very basic print server that
       runs a command for every job that is printed.

OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized by ippeveprinter:

       --help
            Show program usage.

       --no-web-forms
            Disable the web interface forms used to update the media and supply
            levels.

       --pam-service service
            Set the PAM service name.  The default service is "cups".

       --version
            Show the CUPS version.

       -2   Report support for two-sided (duplex) printing.

       -A   Enable authentication for the created printer.  ippeveprinter uses
            PAM to authenticate HTTP Basic credentials.

       -D device-uri
            Set the device URI for print output.  The URI can be a filename,
            directory, or a network socket URI of the form
            "socket://ADDRESS[:PORT]" (where the default port number is 9100).
            When specifying a directory, ippeveprinter will create an output
            file using the job ID and name.

       -F output-type/subtype[,...]
            Specifies the output MIME media type.  The default is
            "application/postscript" when the -P option is specified.

       -M manufacturer
            Set the manufacturer of the printer.  The default is "Example".

       -P filename.ppd
            Load printer attributes from the specified PPD file.  This option is
            typically used in conjunction with the ippeveps(7) printer command
            ("-c ippeveps").

       -V 1.1

       -V 2.0
            Specifies the maximum IPP version to report.  2.0 is the default.

       -c command
            Run the specified command for each document that is printed.  If
            "command" is not an absolute path ("/path/to/command"),
            ippeveprinter looks for the command in the "command" subdirectory of
            the CUPS binary directory, typically /usr/lib/cups/command or
            /usr/libexec/cups/command.  The cups-config(1) command can be used
            to discover the correct binary directory ("cups-config
            --serverbin").  In addition, the CUPS_SERVERBIN environment variable
            can be used to override the default location of this directory - see
            the cups(1) man page for more details.

       -d spool-directory
            Specifies the directory that will hold the print files.  The default
            is a directory under the user's current temporary directory.

       -f type/subtype[,...]
            Specifies a list of MIME media types that the server will accept.
            The default depends on the type of printer created.

       -i iconfile.png
            Specifies the printer icon file for the server.  The file must be a
            PNG format image.  The default is an internally-provided PNG image.

       -k   Keeps the print documents in the spool directory rather than
            deleting them.

       -l location
            Specifies the human-readable location string that is reported by the
            server.  The default is the empty string.

       -m model
            Specifies the model name of the printer.  The default is "Printer".

       -n hostname
            Specifies the hostname that is reported by the server.  The default
            is the name returned by the hostname(1) command.

       -p port
            Specifies the port number to listen on.  The default is a user-
            specific number from 8000 to 8999.

       -r off
            Turns off DNS-SD service advertisements entirely.

       -r subtype[,subtype]
            Specifies the DNS-SD subtype(s) to advertise.  Separate multiple
            subtypes with a comma.  The default is "_print".

       -s speed[,color-speed]
            Specifies the printer speed in pages per minute.  If two numbers are
            specified and the second number is greater than zero, the server
            will report support for color printing.  The default is "10,0".

       -v[vvv]
            Be (very) verbose when logging activity to standard error.

EXIT STATUS
       The ippeveprinter program returns 1 if it is unable to process the
       command-line arguments or register the IPP service.  Otherwise
       ippeveprinter will run continuously until terminated.

CONFORMING TO
       The ippeveprinter program is unique to CUPS and conforms to the IPP
       Everywhere (PWG 5100.14) specification.

ENVIRONMENT
       ippeveprinter adds environment variables starting with "IPP_" for all IPP
       Job attributes in the print request.  For example, when executing a
       command for an IPP Job containing the "media" Job Template attribute, the
       "IPP_MEDIA" environment variable will be set to the value of that
       attribute.

       In addition, all IPP "xxx-default" and "pwg-xxx" Printer Description
       attributes are added to the environment.  For example, the
       "IPP_MEDIA_DEFAULT" environment variable will be set to the default value
       for the "media" Job Template attribute.

       Enumerated values are converted to their keyword equivalents.  For
       example, a "print-quality" Job Template attribute with a enum value of 3
       will become the "IPP_PRINT_QUALITY" environment variable with a value of
       "draft".  This string conversion only happens for standard Job Template
       attributes, currently "finishings", "orientation-requested", and "print-
       quality".

       Finally, the "CONTENT_TYPE" environment variable contains the MIME media
       type of the document being printed, the "DEVICE_URI" environment variable
       contains the device URI as specified with the "-D" option, the
       "OUTPUT_FORMAT" environment variable contains the output MIME media type,
       and the "PPD" environment variable contains the PPD filename as specified
       with the "-P" option.

COMMAND OUTPUT
       Unless they communicate directly with a printer, print commands send
       printer-ready data to the standard output.

       Print commands can send messages back to ippeveprinter on the standard
       error with one of the following prefixes:

       ATTR: attribute=value[ attribute=value]
            Sets the named attribute(s) to the given values.  Currently only the
            "job-impressions" and "job-impressions-completed" Job Status
            attributes and the "marker-xxx", "printer-alert", "printer-alert-
            description", "printer-supply", and "printer-supply-description"
            Printer Status attributes can be set.

       DEBUG: Debugging message
            Logs a debugging message if at least two -v's have been specified.

       ERROR: Error message
            Logs an error message and copies the message to the "job-state-
            message" attribute.

       INFO: Informational message
            Logs an informational/progress message if -v has been specified and
            copies the message to the "job-state-message" attribute unless an
            error has been reported.

       STATE: keyword[,keyword,...]
            Sets the printer's "printer-state-reasons" attribute to the listed
            keywords.

       STATE: -keyword[,keyword,...]
            Removes the listed keywords from the printer's "printer-state-
            reasons" attribute.

       STATE: +keyword[,keyword,...]
            Adds the listed keywords to the printer's "printer-state-reasons"
            attribute.

EXAMPLES
       Run ippeveprinter with a service name of My Cool Printer:

           ippeveprinter "My Cool Printer"

       Run the file(1) command whenever a job is sent to the server:

           ippeveprinter -c /usr/bin/file "My Cool Printer"
