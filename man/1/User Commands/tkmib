NAME
       tkmib - an interactive graphical MIB browser for SNMP

SYNOPSIS
       tkmib

DESCRIPTION
       Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) provides a framework for
       exchange of the management information between the agents (servers) and
       clients. The Management Information Bases (MIBs) contain a formal
       description of a set of network objects that can be managed using the
       SNMP for a particular agent. tkmib is a graphical user interface for
       browsing the MIBs. It is also capable of sending or retrieving the SNMP
       management information to/from the remote agents interactively.
