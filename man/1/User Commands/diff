              Compare FILE1 to all operands.  FILE1 can be a directory.

       --to-file=FILE2
              Compare all operands to FILE2.  FILE2 can be a directory.

       --horizon-lines=NUM
              Keep NUM lines of the common prefix and suffix.

       -d  --minimal
              Try hard to find a smaller set of changes.

       --help Output this help.

       FILES are `FILE1 FILE2' or `DIR1 DIR2' or `DIR FILE...' or `FILE... DIR'.
