NAME
       perl5281delta - what is new for perl v5.28.1

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes differences between the 5.28.0 release and the
       5.28.1 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.26.0, first read
       perl5280delta, which describes differences between 5.26.0 and 5.28.0.

Security
   [CVE-2018-18311] Integer overflow leading to buffer overflow and segmentation
       fault
       Integer arithmetic in "Perl_my_setenv()" could wrap when the combined
       length of the environment variable name and value exceeded around
       0x7fffffff.  This could lead to writing beyond the end of an allocated
       buffer with attacker supplied data.

       [perl #133204] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133204>

   [CVE-2018-18312] Heap-buffer-overflow write in S_regatom (regcomp.c)
       A crafted regular expression could cause heap-buffer-overflow write
       during compilation, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.

       [perl #133423] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133423>

Incompatible Changes
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.28.0.  If any
       exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report.  See
       "Reporting Bugs" below.

Modules and Pragmata
   Updated Modules and Pragmata
       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 5.20180622 to
           5.20181129_28.

Selected Bug Fixes
       •   Perl 5.28 introduced an "index()" optimization when comparing to -1
           (or indirectly, e.g. >= 0).  When this optimization was triggered
           inside a "when" clause it caused a warning ("Argument %s isn't
           numeric in smart match").  This has now been fixed.  [perl #133368]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133368>

       •   Matching of decimal digits in script runs, introduced in Perl 5.28,
           had a bug that led to "1\N{THAI DIGIT FIVE}" matching "/^(*sr:\d+)$/"
           when it should not.  This has now been fixed.

       •   The new in-place editing code no longer leaks directory handles.
           [perl #133314] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133314>

Acknowledgements
       Perl 5.28.1 represents approximately 5 months of development since Perl
       5.28.0 and contains approximately 6,100 lines of changes across 44 files
       from 12 authors.

       Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there
       were approximately 700 lines of changes to 12 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

       Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant
       community of users and developers.  The following people are known to
       have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.28.1:

       Aaron Crane, Abigail, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsaaker,
       David Mitchell, James E Keenan, John SJ Anderson, Karen Etheridge, Karl
       Williamson, Sawyer X, Steve Hay, Tony Cook.

       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
       generated from version control history.  In particular, it does not
       include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
       modules included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN
       community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please
       see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.

Reporting Bugs
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug
       database at <https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
       <http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
       included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
       sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of "perl
       -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
       porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
       "SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec for details of
       how to report the issue.

Give Thanks
       If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl
       5, you can do so by running the "perlthanks" program:

           perlthanks

       This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of
       thanks.
