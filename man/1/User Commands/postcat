POSTCAT(1)                   General Commands Manual                  POSTCAT(1)




NAME
       postcat - show Postfix queue file contents

SYNOPSIS
       postcat [-bdehnoqv] [-c config_dir] [files...]

DESCRIPTION
       The postcat(1) command prints the contents of the named files in
       human-readable form. The files are expected to be in Postfix queue file
       format. If no files are specified on the command line, the program reads
       from standard input.

       By default, postcat(1) shows the envelope and message content, as if the
       options -beh were specified. To view message content only, specify -bh
       (Postfix 2.7 and later).

       Options:

       -b     Show body content.  The -b option starts producing output at the
              first non-header line, and stops when the end of the message is
              reached.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.7 and later.

       -c config_dir
              The main.cf configuration file is in the named directory instead
              of the default configuration directory.

       -d     Print the decimal type of each record.

       -e     Show message envelope content.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.7 and later.

       -h     Show message header content.  The -h option produces output from
              the beginning of the message up to, but not including, the first
              non-header line.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.7 and later.

       -o     Print the queue file offset of each record.

       -q     Search the Postfix queue for the named files instead of taking the
              names literally.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

       -v     Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple -v options
              make the software increasingly verbose.
