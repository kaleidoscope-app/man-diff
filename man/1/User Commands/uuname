NAME
       uuname - list remote UUCP sites

SYNOPSIS
       uuname [-a] [--aliases]

       uuname [-l] [--local]

DESCRIPTION
       By default, the uuname program simply lists the names of all the remote
       systems mentioned in the UUCP configuration files.

       The uuname program may also be used to print the UUCP name of the local
       system.

       The uuname program is mainly for use by shell scripts.

OPTIONS
       -a, --aliases
            List all aliases for remote systems, as well as their canonical
            names.  Aliases may be specified in the `sys' file.

       -l, --local
            Print the UUCP name of the local system, rather than listing the
            names of all the remote systems.

       -x type, --debug type
            Turn on particular debugging types.  The following types are
            recognized: abnormal, chat, handshake, uucp-proto, proto, port,
            config, spooldir, execute, incoming, outgoing.
