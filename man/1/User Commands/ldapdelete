DESCRIPTION
       ldapdelete is a shell-accessible interface to the ldap_delete_ext(3)
       library call.

       ldapdelete opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds, and deletes one
       or more entries.  If one or more DN arguments are provided, entries with
       those Distinguished Names are deleted.  Each DN should be provided using
       the LDAPv3 string representation as defined in RFC 4514.  If no DN
       arguments are provided, a list of DNs is read from standard input (or
       from file if the -f flag is used).

OPTIONS
       -n     Show what would be done, but don't actually delete entries.
              Useful for debugging in conjunction with -v.

       -v     Use verbose mode, with many diagnostics written to standard
              output.

       -c     Continuous operation mode.  Errors  are  reported,  but ldapdelete
              will  continue  with  deletions.   The default is to exit after
              reporting an error.

       -M[M]  Enable manage DSA IT control.  -MM makes control critical.

       -d_debuglevel
              Set the LDAP debugging level to debuglevel.  ldapdelete must be
              compiled with LDAP_DEBUG defined for this option to have any
              effect.

       -f_file
              Read a series of DNs from file, one per line, performing an LDAP
              delete for each.

       -x     Use simple authentication instead of SASL.

       -D_binddn
              Use the Distinguished Name binddn to bind to the LDAP directory.
              For SASL binds, the server is expected to ignore this value.

       -W     Prompt for simple authentication.  This is used instead of
              specifying the password on the command line.

       -w_passwd
              Use passwd as the password for simple authentication.

       -y_passwdfile
              Use complete contents of passwdfile as the password for simple
              authentication.

       -H_ldapuri
              Specify URI(s) referring to the ldap server(s); only the
              protocol/host/port fields are allowed; a list of URI, separated by
              whitespace or commas is expected.

       -h_ldaphost
              Specify an alternate host on which the ldap server is running.
              Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -p_ldapport
              Specify an alternate TCP port where the ldap server is listening.
              Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -P {2|3}
              Specify the LDAP protocol version to use.

       -e [!]ext[=extparam]

       -E [!]ext[=extparam]

              Specify general extensions with -e and search extensions with -E.
              ´!´ indicates criticality.

              General extensions:
                [!]assert=<filter>   (an RFC 4515 Filter)
                [!]authzid=<authzid> ("dn:<dn>" or "u:<user>")
                [!]manageDSAit
                [!]noop
                ppolicy
                [!]postread[=<attrs>]        (a comma-separated attribute list)
                [!]preread[=<attrs>] (a comma-separated attribute list)
                abandon, cancel (SIGINT sends abandon/cancel; not really controls)

              Search extensions:
                [!]domainScope                               (domain scope)
                [!]mv=<filter>                               (matched values filter)
                [!]pr=<size>[/prompt|noprompt]       (paged results/prompt)
                [!]sss=[-]<attr[:OID]>[/[-]<attr[:OID]>...]  (server side sorting)
                [!]subentries[=true|false]           (subentries)
                [!]sync=ro[/<cookie>]                        (LDAP Sync refreshOnly)
                        rp[/<cookie>][/<slimit>]     (LDAP Sync refreshAndPersist)

       -r     Do a recursive delete.  If the DN specified isn't a leaf, its
              children, and all their children are deleted down the tree.  No
              verification is done, so if you add this switch, ldapdelete will
              happily delete large portions of your tree.  Use with care.

       -z_sizelimit
              Use sizelimit when searching for children DN to delete, to
              circumvent any server-side size limit.  Only useful in conjunction
              with -r.

       -O_security-properties
              Specify SASL security properties.

       -I     Enable SASL Interactive mode.  Always prompt.  Default is to
              prompt only as needed.

       -Q     Enable SASL Quiet mode.  Never prompt.

       -U_authcid
              Specify the authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of the
              identity depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -R_realm
              Specify the realm of authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of
              the realm depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -X_authzid
              Specify the requested authorization ID for SASL bind.  authzid
              must be one of the following formats: dn:<distinguished name> or
              u:<username>

       -Y_mech
              Specify the SASL mechanism to be used for authentication. If it's
              not specified, the program will choose the best mechanism the
              server knows.

       -Z[Z]  Issue StartTLS (Transport Layer Security) extended operation. If
              you use -ZZ, the command will require the operation to be
              successful.

EXAMPLE
       The following command:

           ldapdelete "cn=Delete Me,dc=example,dc=com"

       will attempt to delete the entry named "cn=Delete Me,dc=example,dc=com".
       Of course it would probably be necessary to supply authentication
       credentials.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit status is 0 if no errors occur.  Errors result in a non-zero exit
       status and a diagnostic message being written to standard error.
