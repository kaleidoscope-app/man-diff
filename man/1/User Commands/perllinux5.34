NAME
       perllinux - Perl version 5 on Linux systems

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes various features of Linux that will affect how
       Perl version 5 (hereafter just Perl) is compiled and/or runs.

   Deploying Perl on Linux
       Normally one can install /usr/bin/perl on Linux using your distribution's
       package manager (e.g: "sudo apt-get install perl", or "sudo dnf install
       perl"). Note that sometimes one needs to install some extra system
       packages in order to be able to use CPAN frontends, and that messing with
       the system's perl is not always recommended. One can use perlbrew
       <https://perlbrew.pl/> to avoid such issues.

       Otherwise, perl should build fine on Linux using the mainstream compilers
       GCC and clang, while following the usual instructions.

   Experimental Support for Sun Studio Compilers for Linux OS
       Sun Microsystems has released a port of their Sun Studio compilers for
       Linux.  As of May 2019, the last stable release took place on 2017, and
       one can buy support contracts for them.

       There are some special instructions for building Perl with Sun Studio on
       Linux.  Following the normal "Configure", you have to run make as
       follows:

           LDLOADLIBS=-lc make

       "LDLOADLIBS" is an environment variable used by the linker to link "/ext"
       modules to glibc.  Currently, that environment variable is not getting
       populated by a combination of "Config" entries and "ExtUtil::MakeMaker".
       While there may be a bug somewhere in Perl's configuration or
       "ExtUtil::MakeMaker" causing the problem, the most likely cause is an
       incomplete understanding of Sun Studio by this author.  Further
       investigation is needed to get this working better.
