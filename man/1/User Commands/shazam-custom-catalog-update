SYNOPSIS
     shazam custom-catalog update [--input input]
                                  [--signature-asset signature-asset]

DESCRIPTION
     Use this command to update an existing custom catalog file with a shazam
     signature and associated media items. A shazam signature can be generated
     from any of the following inputs:

     1.   A .shazamsignature file

     2.   An audio file

     3.   A video file

     Media items can be grouped in a .csv file and passed to this command to be
     associated with the shazam signature as metadata in the updated custom
     catalog.

OPTIONS
     -i,--input input
             Path to the existing custom catalog file to update.


     -m,--media-items media-items
             Path to a .csv file containing metadata to be associated with a
             shazam signature.


     -o,--output output
             Path to save the updated custom catalog file. If this is a
             directory a new custom catalog file is created in that directory
             with the same name as the file passed in signature-asset.  If this
             argument isn't passed in, the existing catalog file is updated in
             place and the custom catalog file at input is overwritten with the
             updated file.
