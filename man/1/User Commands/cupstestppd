NAME
       cupstestppd - test conformance of ppd files

SYNOPSIS
       cupstestppd [ -I category ] [ -R rootdir ] [ -W category ] [ -q ] [ -r ]
       [ -v[v] ] filename.ppd[.gz] [ ...  filename.ppd[.gz] ]
       cupstestppd [ -R rootdir ] [ -W category ] [ -q ] [ -r ] [ -v[v] ] -

DESCRIPTION
       cupstestppd tests the conformance of PPD files to the Adobe PostScript
       Printer Description file format specification version 4.3.  It can also
       be used to list the supported options and available fonts in a PPD file.
       The results of testing and any other output are sent to the standard
       output.

       The first form of cupstestppd tests one or more PPD files on the command-
       line.  The second form tests the PPD file provided on the standard input.

OPTIONS
       cupstestppd supports the following options:

       -I filename
            Ignores all PCFileName warnings.

       -I filters
            Ignores all filter errors.

       -I profiles
            Ignores all profile errors.

       -R rootdir
            Specifies an alternate root directory for the filter, pre-filter,
            and other support file checks.

       -W constraints
            Report all UIConstraint errors as warnings.

       -W defaults
            Except for size-related options, report all default option errors as
            warnings.

       -W filters
            Report all filter errors as warnings.

       -W profiles
            Report all profile errors as warnings.

       -W sizes
            Report all media size errors as warnings.

       -W translations
            Report all translation errors as warnings.

       -W all
            Report all of the previous errors as warnings.

       -W none
            Report all of the previous errors as errors.

       -q   Specifies that no information should be displayed.

       -r   Relaxes the PPD conformance requirements so that common whitespace,
            control character, and formatting problems are not treated as hard
            errors.

       -v   Specifies that detailed conformance testing results should be
            displayed rather than the concise PASS/FAIL/ERROR status.

       -vv  Specifies that all information in the PPD file should be displayed
            in addition to the detailed conformance testing results.

       The -q, -v, and -vv options are mutually exclusive.

EXIT STATUS
       cupstestppd returns zero on success and non-zero on error.  The error
       codes are as follows:

       1    Bad command-line arguments or missing PPD filename.

       2    Unable to open or read PPD file.

       3    The PPD file contains format errors that cannot be skipped.

       4    The PPD file does not conform to the Adobe PPD specification.

EXAMPLES
       The following command will test all PPD files under the current directory
       and print the names of each file that does not conform:

           find . -name \*.ppd \! -exec cupstestppd -q '{}' \; -print

       The next command tests all PPD files under the current directory and
       print detailed conformance testing results for the files that do not
       conform:

           find . -name \*.ppd \! -exec cupstestppd -q '{}' \; \
               -exec cupstestppd -v '{}' \;

NOTES
       PPD files are deprecated and will no longer be supported in a future
       feature release of CUPS.  Printers that do not support IPP can be
       supported using applications such as ippeveprinter(1).
