SNMPBULKGET(1)                      Net-SNMP                      SNMPBULKGET(1)



NAME
       snmpbulkget - communicates with a network entity using SNMP GETBULK
       requests.

SYNOPSIS
       snmpbulkget [COMMON OPTIONS] [-Cn <num>] [-Cr <NUM>] AGENT OID [OID]...

DESCRIPTION
       snmpbulkget is an SNMP application that uses the SNMP GETBULK request to
       query a network entity efficiently for information.  One or more object
       identifiers (OIDs) may be given as arguments on the command line.  Each
       variable name is given in the format specified in variables(5).

       If the network entity has an error processing the request packet, an
       error packet will be returned and a message will be shown, helping to
       pinpoint why the request was malformed.

OPTIONS
       -Cn<NUM>
               Set the non-repeaters field in the GETBULK PDU.  This specifies
               the number of supplied variables that should not be iterated
               over.  The default is 0.

       -Cr<NUM>
               Set the max-repetitions field in the GETBULK PDU.  This specifies
               the maximum number of iterations over the repeating variables.
               The default is 10.

       In addition to these options, snmpbulkget takes the common options
       described in the snmpcmd(1) manual page.  Note that snmpbulkget REQUIRES
       an argument specifying the agent to query and at least one OID argument,
       as described there.

EXAMPLE
       The command:

       snmpbulkget -v2c -Cn1 -Cr5 -Os -c public zeus system ifTable

       will retrieve the variable system.sysDescr.0 (which is the
       lexicographically next object to system) and the first 5 objects in the
       ifTable:

       sysDescr.0 = STRING: "SunOS zeus.net.cmu.edu 4.1.3_U1 1 sun4m"
       ifIndex.1 = INTEGER: 1
       ifIndex.2 = INTEGER: 2
       ifDescr.1 = STRING: "lo0"
       et cetera.

NOTE
       As the name implies, snmpbulkget utilizes the SNMP GETBULK message, which
       is not available in SNMPv1.
