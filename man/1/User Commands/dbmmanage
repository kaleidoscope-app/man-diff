NAME
       dbmmanage - Manage user authentication files in DBM format


SYNOPSIS
       dbmmanage [ encoding ] filename add|adduser|check|delete|update username
       [ encpasswd [ group[,group...] [ comment ] ] ]


       dbmmanage filename view [ username ]


       dbmmanage filename import



SUMMARY
       dbmmanage is used to create and update the DBM format files used to store
       usernames and password for basic authentication of HTTP users via
       mod_authn_dbm. Resources available from the Apache HTTP server can be
       restricted to just the users listed in the files created by dbmmanage.
       This program can only be used when the usernames are stored in a DBM
       file. To use a flat-file database see htpasswd.


       Another tool to maintain a DBM password database is htdbm.


       This manual page only lists the command line arguments. For details of
       the directives necessary to configure user authentication in httpd see
       the httpd manual, which is part of the Apache distribution or can be
       found at http://httpd.apache.org/.



OPTIONS
       filename
              The filename of the DBM format file. Usually without the extension
              .db, .pag, or .dir.

       username
              The user for which the operations are performed. The username may
              not contain a colon (:).

       encpasswd
              This is the already encrypted password to use for the update and
              add commands. You may use a hyphen (-) if you want to get prompted
              for the password, but fill in the fields afterwards. Additionally
              when using the update command, a period (.) keeps the original
              password untouched.

       group  A group, which the user is member of. A groupname may not contain
              a colon (:). You may use a hyphen (-) if you don't want to assign
              the user to a group, but fill in the comment field. Additionally
              when using the update command, a period (.) keeps the original
              groups untouched.

       comment
              This is the place for your opaque comments about the user, like
              realname, mailaddress or such things. The server will ignore this
              field.


   Encodings
       -d     crypt encryption (default, except on Win32, Netware)

       -m     MD5 encryption (default on Win32, Netware)

       -s     SHA1 encryption

       -p     plaintext (not recommended)


   Commands
       add    Adds an entry for username to filename using the encrypted
              password encpasswd. dbmmanage passwords.dat add rbowen
              foKntnEF3KSXA

       adduser
              Asks for a password and then adds an entry for username to
              filename. dbmmanage passwords.dat adduser krietz

       check  Asks for a password and then checks if username is in filename and
              if it's password matches the specified one. dbmmanage
              passwords.dat check rbowen

       delete Deletes the username entry from filename. dbmmanage passwords.dat
              delete rbowen

       import Reads username:password entries (one per line) from STDIN and adds
              them to filename. The passwords already have to be crypted.

       update Same as the adduser command, except that it makes sure username
              already exists in filename. dbmmanage passwords.dat update rbowen

       view   Just displays the contents of the DBM file. If you specify a
              username, it displays the particular record only. dbmmanage
              passwords.dat view


BUGS
       One should be aware that there are a number of different DBM file formats
       in existence, and with all likelihood, libraries for more than one format
       may exist on your system. The three primary examples are SDBM, NDBM, the
       GNU project's GDBM, and Berkeley DB 2. Unfortunately, all these libraries
       use different file formats, and you must make sure that the file format
       used by filename is the same format that dbmmanage expects to see.
       dbmmanage currently has no way of determining what type of DBM file it is
       looking at. If used against the wrong format, will simply return nothing,
       or may create a different DBM file with a different name, or at worst, it
       may corrupt the DBM file if you were attempting to write to it.


       dbmmanage has a list of DBM format preferences, defined by the
       @AnyDBM::ISA array near the beginning of the program. Since we prefer the
       Berkeley DB 2 file format, the order in which dbmmanage will look for
       system libraries is Berkeley DB 2, then NDBM, then GDBM and then SDBM.
       The first library found will be the library dbmmanage will attempt to use
       for all DBM file transactions. This ordering is slightly different than
       the standard @AnyDBM::ISA ordering in Perl, as well as the ordering used
       by the simple dbmopen() call in Perl, so if you use any other utilities
       to manage your DBM files, they must also follow this preference ordering.
       Similar care must be taken if using programs in other languages, like C,
       to access these files.


       One can usually use the file program supplied with most Unix systems to
       see what format a DBM file is in.
