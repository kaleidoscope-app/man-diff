SNMPDELTA(1)                        Net-SNMP                        SNMPDELTA(1)



NAME
       snmpdelta - Monitor delta differences in SNMP Counter values

SYNOPSIS
       snmpdelta [ COMMON OPTIONS ] [-Cf] [ -Ct ] [ -Cs ] [ -CS ] [ -Cm ] [ -CF
       configfile ] [ -Cl ] [ -Cp period ] [ -CP Peaks ] [ -Ck ] [ -CT ] AGENT
       OID [ OID ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       snmpdelta will monitor the specified integer valued OIDs, and report
       changes over time.

       AGENT identifies a target SNMP agent, which is instrumented to monitor
       the given objects.  At its simplest, the AGENT specification will consist
       of a hostname or an IPv4 address.  In this situation, the command will
       attempt communication with the agent, using UDP/IPv4 to port 161 of the
       given target host. See snmpcmd(1) for a full list of the possible formats
       for AGENT.

       OID is an object identifier which uniquely identifies the object type
       within a MIB. Multiple OIDs can be specified on a single snmpdelta
       command.

OPTIONS
       COMMON OPTIONS
               Please see snmpcmd(1) for a list of possible values for COMMON
               OPTIONS as well as their descriptions.

       -Cf     Don't fix errors and retry the request.  Without this option, if
               multiple oids have been specified for a single request and if the
               request for one or more of the oids fails, snmpdelta will retry
               the request so that data for oids apart from the ones that failed
               will still be returned.  Specifying -Cf tells snmpdelta not to
               retry a request, even if there are multiple oids specified.

       -Ct     Flag will determine time interval from the monitored entity.

       -Cs     Flag will display a timestamp.

       -CS     Generates a "sum count" in addition to the individual instance
               counts.  The "sum count" is the total of all the individual
               deltas for each time period.

       -Cm     Prints the max value ever attained.

       -CF configfile
               Tells snmpdelta to read it's configuration from the specified
               file.  This options allows the input to be set up in advance
               rather than having to be specified on the command line.

       -Cl     Tells snmpdelta to write it's configuration to files whose names
               correspond to the MIB instances monitored.  For example,
               snmpdelta -Cl localhost ifInOctets.1 will create a file
               "localhost-ifInOctets.1".

       -Cp     Specifies the number of seconds between polling periods.  Polling
               constitutes sending a request to the agent. The default polling
               period is one second.

       -CP peaks
               Specifies the reporting period in number of polling periods.  If
               this option is specified, snmpdelta polls the agent peaks number
               of times before reporting the results.  The result reported
               includes the average value over the reporting period. In
               addition, the highest polled value within the reporting period is
               shown.

       -Ck     When the polling period (-Cp) is an increment of 60 seconds and
               the timestamp is displayed in the output (-Cs), then the default
               display shows the timestamp in the format hh:mm mm/dd. This
               option causes the timestamp format to be hh:mm:ss mm/dd.

       -CT     Makes snmpdelta print its output in tabular form.

       -Cv vars/pkt
               Specifies the maximum number of oids allowed to be packaged in a
               single PDU. Multiple PDUs can be created in a single request. The
               default value of variables per packet is 60.  This option is
               useful if a request response results in an error becaues the
               packet is too big.

       Note that snmpdelta REQUIRES  an argument specifying the agent to query
       and at least one OID argument, as described in the snmpcmd(1) manual
       page.

       The following example uses a number of options. Since the Cl option is
       specified, the output is sent to a file and not to the screen.

       $ snmpdelta -c public -v 1 -Ct -Cs -CS -Cm -Cl -Cp 60 -CP 60
         interlink.sw.net.cmu.edu .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16.3 .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16.4
