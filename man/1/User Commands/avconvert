NAME
     avconvert â€“ movie conversion tool

SYNOPSIS
     avconvert [-hv] -s <source_media> -o <output_movie> -p <preset_name>

DESCRIPTION
     avconvert is a tool that converts source media files to different file
     types for sharing on the web or loading onto devices.  The tool will not
     allow protected content to be converted.  Only one video and one audio
     track is preserved through the conversion, along with metadata tracks.  The
     tool will never resize the video higher than the source dimensions.  If the
     preset internal dimensions are larger than that of the source, the
     conversion will maintain the source dimensions.  The file extension
     provided for the output movie will determine the output file type.

     --source | -s file       The source media file to be converted.

     --output | -o file       The output movie file to be created.

     --preset | -p name       Use the specified preset for file conversion.  All
                              presets encode using AVC (H.264) encoding unless
                              otherwise specified in the preset name.  Use
                              --help to get the full list.

OPTIONS
     --disableFastStart       Disable fast-start movie creation.  Reduces disk
                              accesses if fast-start is not required.

     --disableMetadataFilter  Disable the metadata filter.  Use with caution.
                              This will allow privacy sensitive source metadata
                              to be preserved in the output file.  This may
                              include information such as the location of the
                              video, time when the video was recorded, video
                              capture device information, etc.  If this option
                              is not specified, the aforementioned source
                              metadata is not present in the output file.

     --duration num           Trim the output movie to num seconds (decimal
                              allowed).  Default is end of file.

     --help | -h              Print command usage and list available preset
                              names.

     --multiPass              Perform a higher quality multi-pass encode in the
                              conversion.

     --progress | -prog       Display progress during the conversion (default
                              with -v).

     --replace                Overwrite the output file, if it already exists.

     --start num              Skip the first num seconds (decimal allowed) of
                              the source movie.  Default is beginning of file.

     --verbose | -v           Print additional information about the conversion.

EXAMPLES
     Convert the source movie from 4k HEVC to 720p AVC using the 1280x720
     encoding preset:

          avconvert --source 4k_hevc_movie.mov --output 720p_avc_movie.mov
     --preset Preset1280x720

     Convert the source movie from 4k AVC to 4K HEVC using the
     HEVCHighestQuality encoding preset:

          avconvert -s 4k_avc_movie.mov -o 4k_hevc_movie.mov -p
     PresetHEVCHighestQuality

     Skip the first 3.5 seconds of the source movie and only convert the next 30
     seconds:

          avconvert --source source_movie.mov --output trimmed_movie.mov -p
     PresetMediumQuality --start 3.5 --duration 30

     Convert the source movie from a QuickTime movie file to an MPEG-4 file:

          avconvert -s source_movie.mov -o output_movie.mp4 -p PresetLowQuality
