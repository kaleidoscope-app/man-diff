procsystime(1m)                   USER COMMANDS                  procsystime(1m)



NAME
       procsystime - analyse system call times. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       procsystime [-acehoT] [ -p PID | -n name | command ]

DESCRIPTION
       procsystime prints details on system call times for processes, both the
       elapsed times and on-cpu times can be printed.

       The elapsed times are interesting, to help identify syscalls that take
       some time to complete (during which the process may have slept). CPU time
       helps us identify syscalls that are consuming CPU cycles to run.

       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

OPTIONS
       -a     print all data

       -c     print syscall counts

       -e     print elapsed times, ns

       -o     print CPU times, ns

       -T     print totals

       -p PID examine this PID

       -n name
              examine processes which have this name

EXAMPLES
       Print elapsed times for PID 1871,
              # procsystime -p 1871

       Print elapsed times for processes called "tar",
              # procsystime -n tar

       Print CPU times for "tar" processes,
              # procsystime -on tar

       Print syscall counts for "tar" processes,
              # procsystime -cn tar

       Print elapsed and CPU times for "tar" processes,
              # procsystime -eon tar

       print all details for "bash" processes,
              # procsystime -aTn bash

       run and print details for "df -h",
              # procsystime df -h

FIELDS
       SYSCALL
              System call name

       TIME (ns)
              Total time, nanoseconds

       COUNT  Number of occurrences

DOCUMENTATION
       See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs directory.
       The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with verbose
       descriptions explaining the output.

EXIT
       procsystime will sample until Ctrl-C is hit.
