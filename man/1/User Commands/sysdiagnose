NAME
     sysdiagnose – gathers system-wide diagnostic information helpful in
     investigating system performance issues

SYNOPSIS
     sysdiagnose -h
     sysdiagnose [-H] [-v] [-f results_directory] [-A archive_name]
                 [-V volume_path] [-C, --compression compression_type] [-n] [-k]
                 [-F] [-S] [-u] [-Q] [-b] [-p] [-P] [-g] [-G] [-d] [-D] [-r]
                 [-R] [process_name | pid]

DESCRIPTION
     The sysdiagnose tool gathers system diagnostic information helpful in
     investigating system performance issues.  A great deal of information is
     harvested, spanning system state and configuration. The data is stored
     /var/tmp directory.  sysdiagnose needs to be run as root. To cancel an in-
     flight sysdiagnose triggered via command line interface, press Ctrl-\.
     sysdiagnose is automatically triggered when the following key chord is
     pressed: Control-Option-Command-Shift-Period.

   What sysdiagnose collects:
           •   A spindump of the system
           •   Several seconds of top output
           •   Data about kernel zones
           •   Status of loaded kernel extensions
           •   Resident memory usage of user processes
           •   Recent system logs
           •   A System Profiler report
           •   Recent crash reports
           •   Disk usage information
           •   I/O Kit registry information
           •   Network status
           •   If a specific process is supplied as an argument: list of malloc-
               allocated buffers in the process's heap is collected
           •   If a specific process is supplied as an argument: data about
               unreferenced malloc buffers in the process's memory is collected
           •   If a specific process is supplied as an argument: data about the
               virtual memory regions allocated in the process

OPTIONS
     -h       Display help.

     -H       Print the path to the default sysdiagnose output directory.

     -v       Enable verbose mode to display the container information as it
              executes.

     -f results_directory
              Specify the directory where the results will be stored. The
              default results directory is /var/tmp.

     -A archive_name
              Specify the name of the archive created in the results directory.

     -V volume_path
              Specify the root volume for sysdiagnose to run on.

     -C, --compression compression_type [tar|yaa|default|no-compression]
              Specify the compression type for the resulting sysdiagnose
              directory.

     -n       Do not tar the resulting sysdiagnose directory.

     -k       Do not remove the temporary directory.

     -F       Get feedback data.

     -S       Disable streaming to tarball.

     -u       Disable UI feedback.

     -Q       Skip footprint.

     -q       Same as -Q

     -b       Do NOT show the resulting archive in a Finder window upon
              completion.

     -p       Only run time-sensitive collections; disregards previous -d or -r
              flags.

     -P       Do not run time-sensitive collections.

     -g       Only run log generation collections; disregards previous -p or -r
              flags.

     -G       Do not run log generation collections.

     -d       Only run log copying collections; disregards previous -p or -r
              flags.

     -D       Do not run log copying collections.

     -r       Collect only log archive. Disregards previous -p or -d flags.

     -R       Do not collect log archive.

     process_name | pid
              If a single process appears to be slowing down the system, passing
              in the process name or ID as the argument gathers additional
              process-specific diagnostic data. Specify only ONE process at a
              time -- specifying multiple processes is not supported.

EXIT STATUS
     sysdiagnose exits with status 0 if there were no internal errors
     encountered during the diagnostic, or >0 when an error unrelated to
     external state occurs or unusable input is provided by the user.
