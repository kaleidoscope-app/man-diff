MKFIFO(1)                    General Commands Manual                   MKFIFO(1)

NAME
     mkfifo – make fifos

SYNOPSIS
     mkfifo [-m mode] fifo_name ...

DESCRIPTION
     mkfifo creates the fifos requested, in the order specified.  By default,
     the resulting fifos have mode 0666 (rw-rw-rw-), limited by the current
     umask(2).

     The options are as follows:

     -m      Set the file permission bits of newly-created fifos to mode,
             without respect to the current umask.

             The mode is specified as in chmod(1).  In symbolic mode strings,
             the “+” and “-” operators are interpreted relative to an assumed
             initial mode of “a=rw”

     mkfifo requires write permission in the parent directory.

     mkfifo exits with 0 if successful, and with >0 if an error occurred.

LEGACY DESCRIPTION
     In legacy mode, the fifo's file permission bits are always limited by the
     current umask.

     For more information about legacy mode, see compat(5).
