MKFIFO(1)                    General Commands Manual                   MKFIFO(1)

NAME
     mkfifo – make fifos

SYNOPSIS
     mkfifo [-m mode] fifo_name ...

DESCRIPTION
     The mkfifo utility creates the fifos requested, in the order specified.

     The options are as follows:

     -m      Set the file permission bits of the created fifos to the specified
             mode, ignoring the umask(2) of the calling process.  The mode
             argument takes any format that can be specified to the chmod(1)
             command.  If a symbolic mode is specified, the op symbols ‘+’
             (plus) and ‘-’ (hyphen) are interpreted relative to an assumed
             initial mode of “a=rw” (read and write permissions for all).

     If the -m option is not specified, fifos are created with mode 0666
     modified by the umask(2) of the calling process.  The mkfifo utility
     requires write permission in the parent directory.

EXIT STATUS
     The mkfifo utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
