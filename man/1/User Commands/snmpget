SNMPGET(1)                          Net-SNMP                          SNMPGET(1)



NAME
       snmpget - communicates with a network entity using SNMP GET requests

SYNOPSIS
       snmpget [COMMON OPTIONS] [-Cf] AGENT OID [OID]...

DESCRIPTION
       snmpget is an SNMP application that uses the SNMP GET request to query
       for information on a network entity.  One or more object identifiers
       (OIDs) may be given as arguments on the command line.  Each variable name
       is given in the format specified in variables(5).

OPTIONS
       -Cf     If -Cf is not specified, some applications (snmpdelta, snmpget,
               snmpgetnext and snmpstatus) will try to fix errors returned by
               the agent that you were talking to and resend the request.  The
               only time this is really useful is if you specified a OID that
               didn't exist in your request and you're using SNMPv1 which
               requires "all or nothing" kinds of requests.

       In addition to this option, snmpget takes the common options described in
       the snmpcmd(1) manual page.  Note that snmpget REQUIRES an argument
       specifying the agent to query and at least one OID argument, as described
       there.

EXAMPLES
       The command:

           snmpget -c public zeus system.sysDescr.0

       will retrieve the variable system.sysDescr.0 from the host zeus using the
       community string public :

           system.sysDescr.0 = "SunOS zeus.net.cmu.edu 4.1.3_U1 1 sun4m"

       If the network entity has an error processing the request packet, an
       error packet will be returned and a message will be shown, helping to
       pinpoint in what way the request was malformed.  If there were other
       variables in the request, the request will be resent without the bad
       variable.

       Here is another example. The -c and -v options are defined in the
       snmpcmd(1) manual page. (Note that system.sysUpTime is an incomplete OID,
       as it needs the .0 index appended to it):

           snmpget -v1 -Cf -c public localhost system.sysUpTime system.sysContact.0

       This example will return the following:

           Error in packet
           Reason: (noSuchName) There is no such variable name in this MIB.
           This name doesn't exist: system.sysUpTime

       Similarly, the command:
           snmpget -v1 -c public localhost system.sysUpTime system.sysContact.0

       Will return:

           Error in packet
           Reason: (noSuchName) There is no such variable name in this MIB.
           This name doesn't exist: system.sysUpTime

           system.sysContact.0 = STRING: root@localhost

       With the -Cf flag specified the application will not try to fix the PDU
       for you.
