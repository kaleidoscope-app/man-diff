NAME
       corelist - a commandline frontend to Module::CoreList

DESCRIPTION
       See Module::CoreList for one.

SYNOPSIS
          corelist -v
          corelist [-a|-d] <ModuleName> | /<ModuleRegex>/ [<ModuleVersion>] ...
          corelist [-v <PerlVersion>] [ <ModuleName> | /<ModuleRegex>/ ] ...
          corelist [-r <PerlVersion>] ...
          corelist --utils [-d] <UtilityName> [<UtilityName>] ...
          corelist --utils -v <PerlVersion>
          corelist --feature <FeatureName> [<FeatureName>] ...
          corelist --diff PerlVersion PerlVersion
          corelist --upstream <ModuleName>

OPTIONS
       -a  lists all versions of the given module (or the matching modules, in
           case you used a module regexp) in the perls Module::CoreList knows
           about.

       -d  finds the first perl version where a module has been released by
           date, and not by version number (as is the default).

       --diff
           Given two versions of perl, this prints a human-readable table of all
           module changes between the two.  The output format may change in the
           future, and is meant for humans, not programs.  For programs, use the
           Module::CoreList API.

       -? or -help
           help! help! help! to see more help, try --man.

       -man
           all of the help

       -v  lists all of the perl release versions we got the CoreList for.

           If you pass a version argument (value of $], like 5.00503 or
           5.008008), you get a list of all the modules and their respective
           versions.  (If you have the "version" module, you can also use new-
           style version numbers, like 5.8.8.)

           In module filtering context, it can be used as Perl version filter.

       -r  lists all of the perl releases and when they were released

           If you pass a perl version you get the release date for that version
           only.

       --utils
           lists the first version of perl each named utility program was
           released with

           May be used with -d to modify the first release criteria.

           If used with -v <version> then all utilities released with that
           version of perl are listed, and any utility programs named on the
           command line are ignored.

       --feature, -f
           lists the first version bundle of each named feature given

       --upstream, -u
           Shows if the given module is primarily maintained in perl core or on
           CPAN and bug tracker URL.

       As a special case, if you specify the module name "Unicode", you'll get
       the version number of the Unicode Character Database bundled with the
       requested perl versions.

EXAMPLES
           $ corelist File::Spec

           File::Spec was first released with perl 5.005

           $ corelist File::Spec 0.83

           File::Spec 0.83 was released with perl 5.007003

           $ corelist File::Spec 0.89

           File::Spec 0.89 was not in CORE (or so I think)

           $ corelist File::Spec::Aliens

           File::Spec::Aliens  was not in CORE (or so I think)

           $ corelist /IPC::Open/

           IPC::Open2 was first released with perl 5

           IPC::Open3 was first released with perl 5

           $ corelist /MANIFEST/i

           ExtUtils::Manifest was first released with perl 5.001

           $ corelist /Template/

           /Template/  has no match in CORE (or so I think)

           $ corelist -v 5.8.8 B

           B                        1.09_01

           $ corelist -v 5.8.8 /^B::/
