NAME
       mmroff - reference preprocessor

SYNOPSIS
       mmroff [ -x ] groff_arguments

DESCRIPTION
       mmroff is a simple preprocessor for groff, it is used for expanding
       references in mm, see groff_mm(7).  groff is executed twice, first with
       -z and -rRef=1 to collect all references and then to do the real
       processing when the reference file is up to date.

       -x     Just create the reference file. This can be used to refresh the
              reference file, it isn't always needed to have accurate references
              and by using this option groff will only be run once.
