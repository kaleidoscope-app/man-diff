MANPATH(1)                   General Commands Manual                  MANPATH(1)

NAME
     manpath â€“ display search path for manual pages

SYNOPSIS
     manpath [-Ldq]

DESCRIPTION
     The manpath utility determines the user's manual search path from the
     user's PATH, and local configuration files.  This result is echoed to the
     standard output.

     -L     Output manual locales list instead of the manual path.

     -d     Print extra debugging information.

     -q     Suppresses warning messages.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     The manpath utility constructs the manual path from two sources:
     1.   From each component of the user's PATH for the first of:
          -   pathname/man
          -   pathname/MAN
          -   If pathname ends with /bin: pathname/../share/man and
              pathname/../man
     2.   The configuration files listed in the FILES section for MANPATH
          entries.
     The information from these locations is then concatenated together.

     If the -L flag is set, the manpath utility will search the configuration
     files listed in the FILES section for MANLOCALE entries.

ENVIRONMENT
     The following environment variables affect the execution of manpath:

     MANLOCALES      If set with the -L flag, causes the utility to display a
                     warning and the value, overriding any other configuration
                     found on the system.

     MANPATH         If set, causes the utility to display a warning and the
                     value, overriding any other configuration found on the
                     system.

     PATH            Influences the manual path as described in the
                     IMPLEMENTATION NOTES.
