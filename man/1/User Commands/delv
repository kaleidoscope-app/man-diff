DESCRIPTION
       delv (Domain Entity Lookup & Validation) is a tool for sending DNS
       queries and validating the results, using the the same internal resolver
       and validator logic as named.

       delv will send to a specified name server all queries needed to fetch and
       validate the requested data; this includes the original requested query,
       subsequent queries to follow CNAME or DNAME chains, and queries for
       DNSKEY, DS and DLV records to establish a chain of trust for DNSSEC
       validation. It does not perform iterative resolution, but simulates the
       behavior of a name server configured for DNSSEC validating and
       forwarding.

       By default, responses are validated using built-in DNSSEC trust anchors
       for the root zone (".") and for the ISC DNSSEC lookaside validation zone
       ("dlv.isc.org"). Records returned by delv are either fully validated or
       were not signed. If validation fails, an explanation of the failure is
       included in the output; the validation process can be traced in detail.
       Because delv does not rely on an external server to carry out validation,
       it can be used to check the validity of DNS responses in environments
       where local name servers may not be trustworthy.

       Unless it is told to query a specific name server, delv will try each of
       the servers listed in /etc/resolv.conf. If no usable server addresses are
       found, delv will send queries to the localhost addresses (127.0.0.1 for
       IPv4, ::1 for IPv6).

       When no command line arguments or options are given, delv will perform an
       NS query for "." (the root zone).

SIMPLE USAGE
       A typical invocation of delv looks like:

            delv @server name type

       where:

       server
           is the name or IP address of the name server to query. This can be an
           IPv4 address in dotted-decimal notation or an IPv6 address in
           colon-delimited notation. When the supplied server argument is a
           hostname, delv resolves that name before querying that name server
           (note, however, that this initial lookup is not validated by DNSSEC).

           If no server argument is provided, delv consults /etc/resolv.conf; if
           an address is found there, it queries the name server at that
           address. If either of the -4 or -6 options are in use, then only
           addresses for the corresponding transport will be tried. If no usable
           addresses are found, delv will send queries to the localhost
           addresses (127.0.0.1 for IPv4, ::1 for IPv6).

       name
           is the domain name to be looked up.

       type
           indicates what type of query is required â€” ANY, A, MX, etc.  type can
           be any valid query type. If no type argument is supplied, delv will
           perform a lookup for an A record.

OPTIONS
       -a anchor-file
           Specifies a file from which to read DNSSEC trust anchors. The default
           is /etc/bind.keys, which is included with BIND 9 and contains trust
           anchors for the root zone (".") and for the ISC DNSSEC lookaside
           validation zone ("dlv.isc.org").

           Keys that do not match the root or DLV trust-anchor names are
           ignored; these key names can be overridden using the +dlv=NAME or
           +root=NAME options.

           Note: When reading the trust anchor file, delv treats managed-keys
           statements and trusted-keys statements identically. That is, for a
           managed key, it is the initial key that is trusted; RFC 5011 key
           management is not supported.  delv will not consult the managed-keys
           database maintained by named. This means that if either of the keys
           in /etc/bind.keys is revoked and rolled over, it will be necessary to
           update /etc/bind.keys to use DNSSEC validation in delv.

       -b address
           Sets the source IP address of the query to address. This must be a
           valid address on one of the host's network interfaces or "0.0.0.0" or
           "::". An optional source port may be specified by appending "#<port>"

       -c class
           Sets the query class for the requested data. Currently, only class
           "IN" is supported in delv and any other value is ignored.

       -d level
           Set the systemwide debug level to level. The allowed range is from 0
           to 99. The default is 0 (no debugging). Debugging traces from delv
           become more verbose as the debug level increases. See the +mtrace,
           +rtrace, and +vtrace options below for additional debugging details.

       -h
           Display the delv help usage output and exit.

       -i
           Insecure mode. This disables internal DNSSEC validation. (Note,
           however, this does not set the CD bit on upstream queries. If the
           server being queried is performing DNSSEC validation, then it will
           not return invalid data; this can cause delv to time out. When it is
           necessary to examine invalid data to debug a DNSSEC problem, use dig
           +cd.)

       -m
           Enables memory usage debugging.

       -p port#
           Specifies a destination port to use for queries instead of the
           standard DNS port number 53. This option would be used with a name
           server that has been configured to listen for queries on a
           non-standard port number.

       -q name
           Sets the query name to name. While the query name can be specified
           without using the -q, it is sometimes necessary to disambiguate names
           from types or classes (for example, when looking up the name "ns",
           which could be misinterpreted as the type NS, or "ch", which could be
           misinterpreted as class CH).

       -t type
           Sets the query type to type, which can be any valid query type
           supported in BIND 9 except for zone transfer types AXFR and IXFR. As
           with -q, this is useful to distinguish query name type or class when
           they are ambiguous. it is sometimes necessary to disambiguate names
           from types.

           The default query type is "A", unless the -x option is supplied to
           indicate a reverse lookup, in which case it is "PTR".

       -v
           Print the delv version and exit.

       -x addr
           Performs a reverse lookup, mapping an addresses to a name.  addr is
           an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal notation, or a colon-delimited IPv6
           address. When -x is used, there is no need to provide the name or
           type arguments.  delv automatically performs a lookup for a name like
           11.12.13.10.in-addr.arpa and sets the query type to PTR. IPv6
           addresses are looked up using nibble format under the IP6.ARPA
           domain.

       -4
           Forces delv to only use IPv4.

       -6
           Forces delv to only use IPv6.

QUERY OPTIONS
       delv provides a number of query options which affect the way results are
       displayed, and in some cases the way lookups are performed.

       Each query option is identified by a keyword preceded by a plus sign (+).
       Some keywords set or reset an option. These may be preceded by the string
       no to negate the meaning of that keyword. Other keywords assign values to
       options like the timeout interval. They have the form +keyword=value. The
       query options are:

       +[no]cdflag
           Controls whether to set the CD (checking disabled) bit in queries
           sent by delv. This may be useful when troubleshooting DNSSEC problems
           from behind a validating resolver. A validating resolver will block
           invalid responses, making it difficult to retrieve them for analysis.
           Setting the CD flag on queries will cause the resolver to return
           invalid responses, which delv can then validate internally and report
           the errors in detail.

       +[no]class
           Controls whether to display the CLASS when printing a record. The
           default is to display the CLASS.

       +[no]ttl
           Controls whether to display the TTL when printing a record. The
           default is to display the TTL.

       +[no]rtrace
           Toggle resolver fetch logging. This reports the name and type of each
           query sent by delv in the process of carrying out the resolution and
           validation process: this includes including the original query and
           all subsequent queries to follow CNAMEs and to establish a chain of
           trust for DNSSEC validation.

           This is equivalent to setting the debug level to 1 in the "resolver"
           logging category. Setting the systemwide debug level to 1 using the
           -d option will product the same output (but will affect other logging
           categories as well).

       +[no]mtrace
           Toggle message logging. This produces a detailed dump of the
           responses received by delv in the process of carrying out the
           resolution and validation process.

           This is equivalent to setting the debug level to 10 for the the
           "packets" module of the "resolver" logging category. Setting the
           systemwide debug level to 10 using the -d option will produce the
           same output (but will affect other logging categories as well).

       +[no]vtrace
           Toggle validation logging. This shows the internal process of the
           validator as it determines whether an answer is validly signed,
           unsigned, or invalid.

           This is equivalent to setting the debug level to 3 for the the
           "validator" module of the "dnssec" logging category. Setting the
           systemwide debug level to 3 using the -d option will produce the same
           output (but will affect other logging categories as well).

       +[no]short
           Provide a terse answer. The default is to print the answer in a
           verbose form.

       +[no]comments
           Toggle the display of comment lines in the output. The default is to
           print comments.

       +[no]rrcomments
           Toggle the display of per-record comments in the output (for example,
           human-readable key information about DNSKEY records). The default is
           to print per-record comments.

       +[no]crypto
           Toggle the display of cryptographic fields in DNSSEC records. The
           contents of these field are unnecessary to debug most DNSSEC
           validation failures and removing them makes it easier to see the
           common failures. The default is to display the fields. When omitted
           they are replaced by the string "[omitted]" or in the DNSKEY case the
           key id is displayed as the replacement, e.g. "[ key id = value ]".

       +[no]trust
           Controls whether to display the trust level when printing a record.
           The default is to display the trust level.

       +[no]split[=W]
           Split long hex- or base64-formatted fields in resource records into
           chunks of W characters (where W is rounded up to the nearest multiple
           of 4).  +nosplit or +split=0 causes fields not to be split at all.
           The default is 56 characters, or 44 characters when multiline mode is
           active.

       +[no]all
           Set or clear the display options +[no]comments, +[no]rrcomments, and
           +[no]trust as a group.

       +[no]multiline
           Print long records (such as RRSIG, DNSKEY, and SOA records) in a
           verbose multi-line format with human-readable comments. The default
           is to print each record on a single line, to facilitate machine
           parsing of the delv output.

       +[no]dnssec
           Indicates whether to display RRSIG records in the delv output. The
           default is to do so. Note that (unlike in dig) this does not control
           whether to request DNSSEC records or whether to validate them. DNSSEC
           records are always requested, and validation will always occur unless
           suppressed by the use of -i or +noroot and +nodlv.

       +[no]root[=ROOT]
           Indicates whether to perform conventional (non-lookaside) DNSSEC
           validation, and if so, specifies the name of a trust anchor. The
           default is to validate using a trust anchor of "." (the root zone),
           for which there is a built-in key. If specifying a different trust
           anchor, then -a must be used to specify a file containing the key.

       +[no]dlv[=DLV]
           Indicates whether to perform DNSSEC lookaside validation, and if so,
           specifies the name of the DLV trust anchor. The default is to perform
           lookaside validation using a trust anchor of "dlv.isc.org", for which
           there is a built-in key. If specifying a different name, then -a must
           be used to specify a file containing the DLV key.

macOS NOTICE
       The delv command does not use the host name and address resolution or the
       DNS query routing mechanisms used by other processes running on macOS.
       The results of name or address queries printed by delv may differ from
       those found by other processes that use the macOS native name and address
       resolution mechanisms.  The results of DNS queries may also differ from
       queries that use the macOS DNS routing library.
