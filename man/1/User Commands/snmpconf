SNMPCONF(1)                         Net-SNMP                         SNMPCONF(1)



NAME
       snmpconf - creates and modifies SNMP configuration files

SYNOPSIS
       snmpconf [OPTIONS] [fileToCreate]

       Start with:
              snmpconf -g basic_setup

       Or even just:
              snmpconf

DESCRIPTION
       snmpconf is a simple Perl script that walks you through setting up a
       configuration file step by step.  It should be fairly straight forward to
       use.  Merely run it and answer its questions.

       In its default mode of operation, it prompts the user with menus showing
       sections of the various configuration files it knows about.  When the
       user selects a section, a sub-menu is shown listing of the descriptions
       of the tokens that can be created in that section.  When a description is
       selected, the user is prompted with questions that construct the
       configuration line in question.

       Finally, when the user quits the program any configuration files that
       have been edited by the user are saved to the local directory, fully
       commented.

       A particularly useful option is the -g switch, which walks a user through
       a specific set of configuration questions.  Run:

              snmpconf -g basic_setup

       for an example.

OPTIONS
       -f      Force overwriting existing files in the current directory without
               prompting the user if this is a desired thing to do.

       -i      When finished, install the files into the location where the
               global system commands expect to find them.

       -p      When finished, install the files into the users home directory's
               .snmp subdirectory (where the applications will also search for
               configuration files).

       -I DIRECTORY
               When finished, install the files into the directory DIRECTORY.

       -a      Don't ask any questions.  Simply read in the various known
               configuration files and write them back out again.  This has the
               effect of "auto-commenting" the configuration files for you.  See
               the NEAT TRICKS section below.

       -rall|none
               Read in either all or none of the found configuration files.
               Normally snmpconf prompts you for which files you wish to read
               in.  Reading in these configuration files will merge these files
               with the results of the questions that it asks of you.

       -R FILE,...
               Read in a specific list of configuration files.

       -g GROUPNAME
               Groups of configuration entries can be created that can be used
               to walk a user through a series of questions to create an initial
               configuration file.  There are no menus to navigate, just a list
               of questions.  Run:

                      snmpconf -g basic_setup

               for a good example.

       -G      List all the known groups.

       -c CONFIGDIR
               snmpconf uses a directory of configuration information to learn
               about the files and questions that it should be asking.  This
               option tells snmpconf to use a different location for configuring
               itself.

       -q      Run slightly more quietly.  Since this is an interactive program,
               I don't recommend this option since it only removes information
               from the output that is designed to help you.

       -d      Turn on lots of debugging output.

       -D      Add even more debugging output in the form of Perl variable
               dumps.

NEAT TRICKS
       snmpconf -g basic_setup
              Have I mentioned this command enough yet?  It's designed to walk
              someone through an initial setup for the snmpd(8) daemon.  Really,
              you should try it.

       snmpconf -R /usr/local/snmp/snmpd.conf -a -f snmpd.conf
              Automatically reads in an snmpd.conf file (for example) and adds
              comments to them describing what each token does.  Try it.  It's
              cool.

NOTES
       snmpconf is actually a very generic utility that could be easily
       configured to help construct just about any kind of configuration file.
       Its default configuration set of files are SNMP based.
