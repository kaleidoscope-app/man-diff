base64(1)                    General Commands Manual                   base64(1)

NAME
     base64 â€“ Encode and decode using Base64 representation

SYNOPSIS
     base64 [-h | -D | -d] [-b count] [-i input_file] [-o output_file]

DESCRIPTION
     base64 encodes and decodes Base64 data, as specified in RFC 4648.  With no
     options, base64 reads raw data from stdin and writes encoded data as a
     continuous block to stdout.

OPTIONS
     The following options are available:
     -b count
     --break=count                   Insert line breaks every count characters.
                                     Default is 0, which generates an unbroken
                                     stream.

     -d
     -D
     --decode                        Decode incoming Base64 stream into binary
                                     data.

     -h
     --help                          Print usage summary and exit.

     -i input_file
     --input=input_file              Read input from input_file.  Default is
                                     stdin; passing - also represents stdin.

     -o output_file
     --output=output_file            Write output to output_file.  Default is
                                     stdout; passing - also represents stdout.
