CVMKDIR(1)                   General Commands Manual                  CVMKDIR(1)



NAME
       cvmkdir - Create an Xsan Directory with an Affinity

SYNOPSIS
       cvmkdir [-k key] dirname

DESCRIPTION
       The cvmkdir command creates a Xsan File System directory and attaches an
       affinity parameter (key) to it.  If no option is used and the directory
       exists, the cvmkdir command displays the assigned affinity.  Once an
       affinity is assigned to a directory, it cannot be altered.  If no key is
       specified and the directory does not exist, the directory will not be
       created.

       An affinity may be dissociated from a directory by specifying an empty
       key (e.g., "").

       See snfs_config(5) for details about affinities to storage pools.

OPTIONS
       -k key Specify to the file system what affinity (key) to associate with
              the directory.  All new sub-directories and files created beneath
              this directory inherit its affinity.  If the affinity is changed
              or removed only files or directories created after the change are
              affected.

       dirname
              The path of the directory to be created.
