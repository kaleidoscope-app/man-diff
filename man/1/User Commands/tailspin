DESCRIPTION
     tailspin configures the system to continuously sample callstacks of
     processes and select kdebug events in the kernel trace buffer. When
     tailspin data is recorded to a file, the tailspin file will contain
     information about the system state from about 20s prior to the save. The
     tailspind daemon is a helper daemon for the tailspin feature and should not
     be run manually.

COLLECTING TAILSPIN DATA
     tailspin data can be collected using the keychord when enabled:
     Shift-Control-Option-Command-Comma. When the command is completed, a Finder
     window will pop up with the saved tailspin file.

SUBCOMMANDS
     tailspin uses a subcommand syntax to separate different functionality into
     logical groups.  Each subcommand takes its own set of options.

     info       Print information about the current configuration of tailspin.

     enable     Enable tailspin collection. Enablement persists across reboots
                and upgrade installs.

     disable    Stop tailspin collection. Disablement persists across reboots
                and upgrade installs. tailspin can be enabled again after it has
                been disabled, using the same configuration.

     set        Configure the 4 tunable parameters of tailspin. Any change
                applied will persist across reboots and upgrade installs.

                buffer-size buffer-size-mb
                        Set up the kernel trace buffer to be buffer-size-mb big.

                ktrace-filter-descriptor (add:|remove:)filter-desc
                        Apply the filter-desc to the tailspin configuration,
                        thereby controlling which events are traced by tailspin.
                        See FILTER DESCRIPTIONS on the syntax of a filter. The
                        filter may be prefixed with "add:" or "remove:" to
                        modify an existing filter rather than replace it
                        entirely

                oncore-sampling-period period-in-ns
                        Set up a timer in the tailspin configuration to sample
                        the threads that are on the CPU when the timer fires
                        every period-in-ns.  The minimum period allowed is 1 ms.
                        "disabled" may be used to disable the oncore sampling
                        timer.

                full-system-sampling-period period-in-ns
                        Set up a timer in the tailspin configuration to sample
                        all threads of all processes when the timer fires every
                        period-in-ns.  The minimum period allowed is 10 ms.
                        "disabled" may be used to disable the full sampling
                        timer.

     reset
                [buffer-size-mb|ktrace-filter-descriptor|oncore-sampling-period|full-system-sampling-period]
                Remove all custom configuration of tailspin and reset to system
                default, or reset specific setting to the system default.

     save [-r reason-string] [-l num-seconds] [-n] [path-to-file]

                Save the current contents of the kernel trace buffer containing
                tailspin data to path-to-file.

                -r reason-string
                        Include a key in the tailspin file indicating why it was
                        saved. This reason can be viewed with tailspin stat.

                -l num-seconds
                        Limit the data in tailspin file to that of the last
                        num-seconds.

                -n      Save tailspin file without symbolicating.

     augment [-d] [-s] [-l] [-L -path-to-log-archive] path-to-file
                Augment the tailspin report at path-to-file with additional
                information like symbols, os logs and os signposts.  If not used
                with -d, needs to be run on the same device and build on which
                the tailspin file was saved .

     stat [-v] [-s] path-to-file
                Print aggregate information about the data in the tailspin file.

                -v      Print layout information of tailspin file.

                -s      Sort ktrace statistics by frequency of trace
                        class/subclass. Default sorting is by class/subclass
                        code.

FILTER DESCRIPTIONS
     A filter description is a comma-separated list of class and subclass
     specifiers that indicate which events should be traced.   A class specifier
     starts with ‘C’ followed by a number between 0 and 255 inclusive, specified
     in either decimal or hex (when prepended with "0x"). A subclass specifier
     starts with ‘S’ and takes two bytes.  The high byte is the class and the
     low byte is the subclass of that class.

     For example, this filter description would enable classes 0x1 and 0x25 and
     the subclasses 0x21 and 0x23 of class 0x5: ‘C1,C0x25,S0x0521,S0x0523’.  The
     ‘ALL’ filter description enables events from all classes.

VIEWING TAILSPIN DATA
     tailspin data can be viewed by ktrace(1), spindump(8) and fs_usage(1).

DIAGNOSTICS
     The tailspin utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
