NAME
       tic - the terminfo entry-description compiler

SYNOPSIS
       tic [-01CDGIKLNTUVacfgrstx] [-e names] [-o dir] [-R subset] [-v[n]]
       [-w[n]] file

DESCRIPTION
       The tic command translates a terminfo file from source format into
       compiled format.  The compiled format is necessary for use with the
       library routines in ncurses(3X).

       As described in term(5), the database may be either a directory tree (one
       file per terminal entry) or a hashed database (one record per entry).
       The tic command writes only one type of entry, depending on how it was
       built:

       •   For directory trees, the top-level directory, e.g.,
           /usr/share/terminfo, specifies the location of the database.

       •   For hashed databases, a filename is needed.  If the given file is not
           found by that name, but can be found by adding the suffix ".db", then
           that is used.

           The default name for the hashed database is the same as the default
           directory name (only adding a ".db" suffix).

       In either case (directory or hashed database), tic will create the
       container if it does not exist.  For a directory, this would be the
       "terminfo" leaf, versus a "terminfo.db" file.

       The results are normally placed in the system terminfo database
       /usr/share/terminfo.  The compiled terminal description can be placed in
       a different terminfo database.  There are two ways to achieve this:

       •   First, you may override the system default either by using the -o
           option, or by setting the variable TERMINFO in your shell environment
           to a valid database location.

       •   Secondly, if tic cannot write in /usr/share/terminfo or the location
           specified using your TERMINFO variable, it looks for the directory
           $HOME/.terminfo (or hashed database $HOME/.terminfo.db); if that
           location exists, the entry is placed there.

       Libraries that read terminfo entries are expected to check in succession

       •   a location specified with the TERMINFO environment variable,

       •   $HOME/.terminfo,

       •   directories listed in the TERMINFO_DIRS environment variable,

       •   a compiled-in list of directories (@TERMINFO_DIRS@), and

       •   the system terminfo database (/usr/share/terminfo).

   OPTIONS
       -0     restricts the output to a single line

       -1     restricts the output to a single column

       -a     tells tic to retain commented-out capabilities rather than
              discarding them.  Capabilities are commented by prefixing them
              with a period.  This sets the -x option, because it treats the
              commented-out entries as user-defined names.  If the source is
              termcap, accept the 2-character names required by version 6.
              Otherwise these are ignored.

       -C     Force source translation to termcap format.  Note: this differs
              from the -C option of infocmp(1M) in that it does not merely
              translate capability names, but also translates terminfo strings
              to termcap format.  Capabilities that are not translatable are
              left in the entry under their terminfo names but commented out
              with two preceding dots.  The actual format used incorporates some
              improvements for escaped characters from terminfo format.  For a
              stricter BSD-compatible translation, add the -K option.

              If this is combined with -c, tic makes additional checks to report
              cases where the terminfo values do not have an exact equivalent in
              termcap form.  For example:

              •   sgr usually will not convert, because termcap lacks the
                  ability to work with more than two parameters, and because
                  termcap lacks many of the arithmetic/logical operators used in
                  terminfo.

              •   capabilities with more than one delay or with delays before
                  the end of the string will not convert completely.

       -c     tells tic to only check file for errors, including syntax problems
              and bad use links.  If you specify -C (-I) with this option, the
              code will print warnings about entries which, after use
              resolution, are more than 1023 (4096) bytes long.  Due to a fixed
              buffer length in older termcap libraries, as well as buggy
              checking for the buffer length (and a documented limit in
              terminfo), these entries may cause core dumps with other
              implementations.

              tic checks string capabilities to ensure that those with
              parameters will be valid expressions.  It does this check only for
              the predefined string capabilities; those which are defined with
              the -x option are ignored.

       -D     tells tic to print the database locations that it knows about, and
              exit.  The first location shown is the one to which it would write
              compiled terminal descriptions.  If tic is not able to find a
              writable database location according to the rules summarized
              above, it will print a diagnostic and exit with an error rather
              than printing a list of database locations.

       -e names
              Limit writes and translations to the following comma-separated
              list of terminals.  If any name or alias of a terminal matches one
              of the names in the list, the entry will be written or translated
              as normal.  Otherwise no output will be generated for it.  The
              option value is interpreted as a file containing the list if it
              contains a '/'.  (Note: depending on how tic was compiled, this
              option may require -I or -C.)

       -f     Display complex terminfo strings which contain if/then/else/endif
              expressions indented for readability.

       -G     Display constant literals in decimal form rather than their
              character equivalents.

       -g     Display constant character literals in quoted form rather than
              their decimal equivalents.

       -I     Force source translation to terminfo format.

       -K     Suppress some longstanding ncurses extensions to termcap format,
              e.g., "\s" for space.

       -L     Force source translation to terminfo format using the long C
              variable names listed in <term.h>

       -N     Disable smart defaults.  Normally, when translating from termcap
              to terminfo, the compiler makes a number of assumptions about the
              defaults of string capabilities reset1_string, carriage_return,
              cursor_left, cursor_down, scroll_forward, tab, newline,
              key_backspace, key_left, and key_down, then attempts to use
              obsolete termcap capabilities to deduce correct values.  It also
              normally suppresses output of obsolete termcap capabilities such
              as bs.  This option forces a more literal translation that also
              preserves the obsolete capabilities.

       -odir  Write compiled entries to given database location.  Overrides the
              TERMINFO environment variable.

       -Rsubset
              Restrict output to a given subset.  This option is for use with
              archaic versions of terminfo like those on SVr1, Ultrix, or HP/UX
              that do not support the full set of SVR4/XSI Curses terminfo; and
              outright broken ports like AIX 3.x that have their own extensions
              incompatible with SVr4/XSI.  Available subsets are "SVr1",
              "Ultrix", "HP", "BSD" and "AIX"; see terminfo(5) for details.

       -r     Force entry resolution (so there are no remaining tc capabilities)
              even when doing translation to termcap format.  This may be needed
              if you are preparing a termcap file for a termcap library (such as
              GNU termcap through version 1.3 or BSD termcap through 4.3BSD)
              that does not handle multiple tc capabilities per entry.

       -s     Summarize the compile by showing the database location into which
              entries are written, and the number of entries which are compiled.

       -T     eliminates size-restrictions on the generated text.  This is
              mainly useful for testing and analysis, since the compiled
              descriptions are limited (e.g., 1023 for termcap, 4096 for
              terminfo).

       -t     tells tic to discard commented-out capabilities.  Normally when
              translating from terminfo to termcap, untranslatable capabilities
              are commented-out.

       -U   tells tic to not post-process the data after parsing the source
            file.  Normally, it infers data which is commonly missing in older
            terminfo data, or in termcaps.

       -V   reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and
            exits.

       -vn  specifies that (verbose) output be written to standard error trace
            information showing tic's progress.  The optional parameter n is a
            number from 1 to 10, inclusive, indicating the desired level of
            detail of information.  If n is omitted, the default level is 1.  If
            n is specified and greater than 1, the level of detail is increased.

            The debug flag levels are as follows:

            1      Names of files created and linked

            2      Information related to the “use” facility

            3      Statistics from the hashing algorithm

            5      String-table memory allocations

            7      Entries into the string-table

            8      List of tokens encountered by scanner

            9      All values computed in construction of the hash table

            If the debug level n is not given, it is taken to be one.

       -wn  specifies the width of the output.  The parameter is optional.  If
            it is omitted, it defaults to 60.

       -x   Treat unknown capabilities as user-defined.  That is, if you supply
            a capability name which tic does not recognize, it will infer its
            type (boolean, number or string) from the syntax and make an
            extended table entry for that.  User-defined capability strings
            whose name begins with “k” are treated as function keys.

   PARAMETERS
       file   contains one or more terminfo terminal descriptions in source
              format [see terminfo(5)].  Each description in the file describes
              the capabilities of a particular terminal.

              If file is “-”, then the data is read from the standard input.
              The file parameter may also be the path of a character-device.

   PROCESSING
       All but one of the capabilities recognized by tic are documented in
       terminfo(5).  The exception is the use capability.

       When a use=entry-name field is discovered in a terminal entry currently
       being compiled, tic reads in the binary from /usr/share/terminfo to
       complete the entry.  (Entries created from file will be used first.  tic
       duplicates the capabilities in entry-name for the current entry, with the
       exception of those capabilities that explicitly are defined in the
       current entry.

       When an entry, e.g., entry_name_1, contains a use=entry_name_2 field, any
       canceled capabilities in entry_name_2 must also appear in entry_name_1
       before use= for these capabilities to be canceled in entry_name_1.

       Total compiled entries cannot exceed 4096 bytes.  The name field cannot
       exceed 512 bytes.  Terminal names exceeding the maximum alias length (32
       characters on systems with long filenames, 14 characters otherwise) will
       be truncated to the maximum alias length and a warning message will be
       printed.

COMPATIBILITY
       There is some evidence that historic tic implementations treated
       description fields with no whitespace in them as additional aliases or
       short names.  This tic does not do that, but it does warn when
       description fields may be treated that way and check them for dangerous
       characters.

EXTENSIONS
       Unlike the SVr4 tic command, this implementation can actually compile
       termcap sources.  In fact, entries in terminfo and termcap syntax can be
       mixed in a single source file.  See terminfo(5) for the list of termcap
       names taken to be equivalent to terminfo names.

       The SVr4 manual pages are not clear on the resolution rules for use
       capabilities.  This implementation of tic will find use targets anywhere
       in the source file, or anywhere in the file tree rooted at TERMINFO (if
       TERMINFO is defined), or in the user's $HOME/.terminfo database (if it
       exists), or (finally) anywhere in the system's file tree of compiled
       entries.

       The error messages from this tic have the same format as GNU C error
       messages, and can be parsed by GNU Emacs's compile facility.

       The -0, -1, -C, -G, -I, -N, -R, -T, -V, -a, -e, -f, -g, -o, -r, -s, -t
       and -x options are not supported under SVr4.  The SVr4 -c mode does not
       report bad use links.

       System V does not compile entries to or read entries from your
       $HOME/.terminfo database unless TERMINFO is explicitly set to it.
