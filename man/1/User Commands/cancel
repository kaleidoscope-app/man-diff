cancel(1)                          Apple Inc.                          cancel(1)



NAME
       cancel - cancel jobs

SYNOPSIS
       cancel [ -E ] [ -U username ] [ -a ] [ -h hostname[:port] ] [ -u username
       ] [ -x ] [ id ] [ destination ] [ destination-id ]

DESCRIPTION
       The cancel command cancels print jobs.  If no destination or id is
       specified, the currently printing job on the default destination is
       canceled.

OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized by cancel:

       -a   Cancel all jobs on the named destination, or all jobs on all
            destinations if none is provided.

       -E   Forces encryption when connecting to the server.

       -h hostname[:port]
            Specifies an alternate server.

       -U username
            Specifies the username to use when connecting to the server.

       -u username
            Cancels jobs owned by username.

       -x   Deletes job data files in addition to canceling.

CONFORMING TO
       Unlike the System V printing system, CUPS allows printer names to contain
       any printable character except SPACE, TAB, "/", or "#". Also, printer and
       class names are not case-sensitive.

EXAMPLES
       Cancel the current print job:

           cancel

       Cancel job "myprinter-42":

           cancel myprinter-42

       Cancel all jobs:

           cancel -a

NOTES
       Administrators wishing to prevent unauthorized cancellation of jobs via
       the -u option should require authentication for Cancel-Jobs operations in
       cupsd.conf(5).
