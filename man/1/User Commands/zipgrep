ZIPGREP(1L)                                                          ZIPGREP(1L)



NAME
       zipgrep - search files in a ZIP archive for lines matching a pattern

SYNOPSIS
       zipgrep [egrep_options] pattern file[.zip] [file(s) ...]
       [-x xfile(s) ...]

DESCRIPTION
       zipgrep will search files within a ZIP archive for lines matching the
       given string or pattern.  zipgrep is a shell script and requires egrep(1)
       and unzip(1L) to function.  Its output is identical to that of egrep(1).

ARGUMENTS
       pattern
              The pattern to be located within a ZIP archive.  Any string or
              regular expression accepted by egrep(1) may be used.  file[.zip]
              Path of the ZIP archive.  (Wildcard expressions for the ZIP
              archive name are not supported.)  If the literal filename is not
              found, the suffix .zip is appended.  Note that self-extracting ZIP
              files are supported, as with any other ZIP archive; just specify
              the .exe suffix (if any) explicitly.

       [file(s)]
              An optional list of archive members to be processed, separated by
              spaces.  If no member files are specified, all members of the ZIP
              archive are searched.  Regular expressions (wildcards) may be used
              to match multiple members:

              *      matches a sequence of 0 or more characters

              ?      matches exactly 1 character

              [...]  matches any single character found inside the brackets;
                     ranges are specified by a beginning character, a hyphen,
                     and an ending character.  If an exclamation point or a
                     caret (`!' or `^') follows the left bracket, then the range
                     of characters within the brackets is complemented (that is,
                     anything except the characters inside the brackets is
                     considered a match).

              (Be sure to quote any character that might otherwise be
              interpreted or modified by the operating system.)

       [-x xfile(s)]
              An optional list of archive members to be excluded from
              processing.  Since wildcard characters match directory separators
              (`/'), this option may be used to exclude any files that are in
              subdirectories.  For example, ``zipgrep grumpy foo *.[ch] -x */*''
              would search for the string ``grumpy'' in all C source files in
              the main directory of the ``foo'' archive, but none in any
              subdirectories.  Without the -x option, all C source files in all
              directories within the zipfile would be searched.

OPTIONS
       All options prior to the ZIP archive filename are passed to egrep(1).
