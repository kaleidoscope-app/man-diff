CALENDAR(1)                  General Commands Manual                 CALENDAR(1)

NAME
     calendar – reminder service

SYNOPSIS
     calendar [-a] [-A num] [-B num] [-F friday] [-f calendarfile]
              [-t dd[.mm[.year]]] [-W num]

DESCRIPTION
     The calendar utility checks the current directory for a file named calendar
     and displays lines that begin with either today's date or tomorrow's.  On
     the day before a weekend (normally Friday), events for the next three days
     are displayed.

     The following options are available:

     -A num  Print lines from today and the next num days (forward, future).

     -a      Process the ``calendar'' files of all users and mail the results to
             them.  This requires super-user privileges.

     -B num  Print lines from today and the previous num days (backward, past).

     -F friday
             Specify which day of the week is ``Friday'' (the day before the
             weekend begins).  Default is 5.

     -f calendarfile
             Use calendarfile as the default calendar file.

     -t dd[.mm[.year]]
             For test purposes only: set date directly to argument values.

     -W num  Print lines from today and the next num days (forward, future).
             Ignore weekends when calculating the number of days.

     To handle calendars in your national code table you can specify
     “LANG=<locale_name>” in the calendar file as early as possible.  To handle
     national Easter names in the calendars “Easter=<national_name>” (for
     Catholic Easter) or “Paskha=<national_name>” (for Orthodox Easter) can be
     used.

     Other lines should begin with a month and day.  They may be entered in
     almost any format, either numeric or as character strings.  If the proper
     locale is set, national month and weekday names can be used.  A single
     asterisk (``*'') matches every month.  A day without a month matches that
     day of every week.  A month without a day matches the first of that month.
     Two numbers default to the month followed by the day.  Lines with leading
     tabs default to the last entered date, allowing multiple line
     specifications for a single date.

     ``Easter'', is Easter for this year, and may be followed by a positive or
     negative integer.

     ``Paskha'', is Orthodox Easter for this year, and may be followed by a
     positive or negative integer.

     Weekdays may be followed by ``-4'' ... ``+5'' (aliases for last, first,
     second, third, fourth) for moving events like ``the last Monday in April''.

     By convention, dates followed by an asterisk are not fixed, i.e., change
     from year to year.

     Day descriptions start after the first <tab> character in the line; if the
     line does not contain a <tab> character, it is not displayed.  If the first
     character in the line is a <tab> character, it is treated as a continuation
     of the previous line.

     The ``calendar'' file is preprocessed by cpp(1), allowing the inclusion of
     shared files such as lists of company holidays or meetings.  If the shared
     file is not referenced by a full pathname, cpp(1) searches in the current
     (or home) directory first, and then in the directory /usr/share/calendar.
     Empty lines and lines protected by the C commenting syntax (/* ... */) are
     ignored.

     Some possible calendar entries (<tab> characters highlighted by \t
     sequence)

           LANG=C
           Easter=Ostern

           #include <calendar.usholiday>
           #include <calendar.birthday>

     anywhere in the line.  This is no longer true, the date is only recognized
     when it occurs at the beginning of a line.
