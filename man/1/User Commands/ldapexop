NAME
       ldapexop - issue LDAP extended operations


SYNOPSIS
       ldapexop [-d_level] [-D_binddn] [-e [!]ext[=extparam]] [-f_file]
       [-h_host] [-H_URI] [-I] [-n] [-N] [-O_security-properties]
       [-o_opt[=optparam]] [-p_port] [-Q] [-R_realm] [-U_authcid] [-v] [-V]
       [-w_passwd] [-W] [-x] [-X_authzid] [-y_file] [-Y_mech] [-Z[Z]] {oid |
       oid:data | oid::b64data | whoami | cancel_cancel-id | refresh_DN [ttl]}


DESCRIPTION
       ldapexop issues the LDAP extended operation specified by oid or one of
       the special keywords whoami, cancel, or refresh.

       Additional data for the extended operation can be passed to the server
       using data or base-64 encoded as b64data in the case of oid, or using the
       additional parameters in the case of the specially named extended
       operations above.

       Please note that ldapexop behaves differently for the same extended
       operation when it was given as an OID or as a specialliy named operation:

       Calling ldapexop with the OID of the whoami (RFC 4532) extended operation

         ldapexop [<options>] 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.11.3

       yields

         # extended operation response
         data:: <base64 encoded response data>

       while calling it with the keyword whoami

         ldapexop [<options>] whoami

       results in

         dn:<client's identity>




OPTIONS
       -d_level
              Set the LDAP debugging level to level.

       -D_binddn
              Use the Distinguished Name binddn to bind to the LDAP directory.

       -e [!]ext[=extparam]
              Specify general extensions.  ´!´ indicates criticality.
                [!]assert=<filter>     (RFC 4528; a RFC 4515 Filter string)
                [!]authzid=<authzid>   (RFC 4370; "dn:<dn>" or "u:<user>")
                [!]chaining[=<resolveBehavior>[/<continuationBehavior>]]
                   one of "chainingPreferred", "chainingRequired",
                   "referralsPreferred", "referralsRequired"
                [!]manageDSAit         (RFC 3296)
                [!]noop
                ppolicy
                [!]postread[=<attrs>]  (RFC 4527; comma-separated attr list)
                [!]preread[=<attrs>]   (RFC 4527; comma-separated attr list)
                [!]relax
                abandon, cancel, ignore (SIGINT sends abandon/cancel,
                or ignores response; if critical, doesn't wait for SIGINT.
                not really controls)

       -f_file
              Read operations from file.

       -h_host
              Specify the host on which the ldap server is running.  Deprecated
              in favor of -H.

       -H_URI Specify URI(s) referring to the ldap server(s); only the
              protocol/host/port fields are allowed; a list of URI, separated by
              whitespace or commas is expected.

       -I     Enable SASL Interactive mode.  Always prompt.  Default is to
              prompt only as needed.

       -n     Show what would be done but don't actually do it.  Useful for
              debugging in conjunction with -v.

       -N     Do not use reverse DNS to canonicalize SASL host name.

       -O_security-properties
              Specify SASL security properties.

       -o_opt[=optparam]
              Specify general options:
                nettimeout=<timeout> (in seconds, or "none" or "max")

       -p_port
              Specify the TCP port where the ldap server is listening.
              Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -Q     Enable SASL Quiet mode.  Never prompt.

       -R_realm
              Specify the realm of authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of
              the realm depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -U_authcid
              Specify the authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of the ID
              depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -v     Run in verbose mode, with many diagnostics written to standard
              output.

       -V     Print version info and usage message.  If-VV is given, only the
              version information is printed.

       -w_passwd
              Use passwd as the password for simple authentication.

       -W     Prompt for simple authentication.  This is used instead of
              specifying the password on the command line.

       -x     Use simple authentication instead of SASL.

       -X_authzid
              Specify the requested authorization ID for SASL bind.  authzid
              must be one of the following formats: dn:<distinguished name> or
              u:<username>

       -y_file
              Use complete contents of file as the password for simple
              authentication.

       -Y_mech
              Specify the SASL mechanism to be used for authentication.  Without
              this option, the program will choose the best mechanism the server
              knows.

       -Z[Z]  Issue StartTLS (Transport Layer Security) extended operation.
              Giving it twice (-ZZ) will require the operation to be successful.


DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit status is zero if no errors occur.  Errors result in a non-zero exit
       status and a diagnostic message being written to standard error.
