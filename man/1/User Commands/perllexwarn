NAME
       perllexwarn - Perl Lexical Warnings

DESCRIPTION
       Perl v5.6.0 introduced lexical control over the handling of warnings by
       category.  The "warnings" pragma generally replaces the command line flag
       -w.  Documentation on the use of lexical warnings, once partly found in
       this document, is now found in the warnings documentation.
