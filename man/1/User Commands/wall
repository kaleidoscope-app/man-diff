WALL(1)                      General Commands Manual                     WALL(1)

NAME
     wall â€“ write a message to users

SYNOPSIS
     wall [-g group] [file]

DESCRIPTION
     The wall utility displays the contents of file or, by default, its standard
     input, on the terminals of all currently logged in users.

     Only the super-user can write on the terminals of users who have chosen to
     deny messages or are using a program which automatically denies messages.

     -g      Send messages to users in this group.  This option may be specified
             multiple times, and any user in any of the specified groups will
             receive the message.

SEE ALSO
     mesg(1), talk(1), write(1), shutdown(8)

HISTORY
     A wall command appeared in PWB UNIX.

BUGS
     The sender's LC_CTYPE setting is used to determine which characters are
     safe to write to a terminal, not the receiver's (which wall has no way of
     knowing).

     The wall utility does not recognize multibyte characters.
