db_verify(1)                 General Commands Manual                db_verify(1)

NAME
     db_verify

SYNOPSIS
     db_verify [-NoqV] [-h home] [-P password] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     The db_verify utility verifies the structure of one or more files and the
     databases they contain.

     The options are as follows:

     -h
       Specify a home directory for the database environment; by default, the
       current working directory is used.

     -o
       Skip the database checks for btree and duplicate sort order and for
       hashing.

       If the file being verified contains databases with non-default comparison
       or hashing configurations, calling the db_verify utility without the -o
       flag will usually return failure. The -o flag causes db_verify to ignore
       database sort or hash ordering and allows db_verify to be used on these
       files. To fully verify these files, verify them explicitly using the
       DB->verify method, after configuring the correct comparison or hashing
       functions.

     -N
       Do not acquire shared region mutexes while running. Other problems, such
       as potentially fatal errors in Berkeley DB, will be ignored as well. This
       option is intended only for debugging errors, and should not be used
       under any other circumstances.

     -P
       Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite
       password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a window of
       vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see command-line
       arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory
       containing the command-line arguments.

     -q
       Suppress the printing of any error descriptions, simply exit success or
       failure.

     -V
       Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

     The db_verify utility does not perform any locking, even in Berkeley DB
     environments that are configured with a locking subsystem. As such, it
     should only be used on files that are not being modified by another thread
     of control.

     The db_verify utility may be used with a Berkeley DB environment (as
     described for the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because
     the utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment).
     In order to avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB
     environment, db_verify should always be given the chance to detach from the
     environment and exit gracefully. To cause db_verify to release all
     environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal
     (SIGINT).

     The db_verify utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

ENVIRONMENT
     DB_HOME  If the -h option is not specified and the environment variable
              DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as
              described in DB_ENV->open.
