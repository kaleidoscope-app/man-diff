DESCRIPTION
       xsltproc is a command line tool for applying XSLT stylesheets to XML
       documents. It is part of libxslt(3), the XSLT C library for GNOME. While
       it was developed as part of the GNOME project, it can operate
       independently of the GNOME desktop.

       xsltproc is invoked from the command line with the name of the stylesheet
       to be used followed by the name of the file or files to which the
       stylesheet is to be applied. It will use the standard input if a filename
       provided is - .

       If a stylesheet is included in an XML document with a Stylesheet
       Processing Instruction, no stylesheet need to be named at the command
       line.  xsltproc will automatically detect the included stylesheet and use
       it.

       By default, output is to stdout. You can specify a file for output using
       the -o or --output option.

OPTIONS
       xsltproc accepts the following options (in alphabetical order):

       --catalogs
           Use the SGML catalog specified in SGML_CATALOG_FILES to resolve the
           location of external entities. By default, xsltproc looks for the
           catalog specified in XML_CATALOG_FILES. If that is not specified, it
           uses /etc/xml/catalog.

       --debug
           Output an XML tree of the transformed document for debugging
           purposes.

       --dumpextensions
           Dumps the list of all registered extensions on stdout.

       --html
           The input document is an HTML file.

       --load-trace
           Display all the documents loaded during the processing to stderr.

       --maxdepth VALUE
           Adjust the maximum depth of the template stack before libxslt(3)
           concludes it is in an infinite loop. The default is 3000.

       --maxvars VALUE
           Maximum number of variables. The default is 15000.

       --maxparserdepth VALUE
           Maximum element nesting level of parsed XML documents. The default is
           256.

       --huge
           Relax hardcoded limits of the XML parser by setting the
           XML_PARSE_HUGE parser option.

       --seed-rand VALUE
           Initialize pseudo random number generator with specific seed.

       --nodtdattr
           Do not apply default attributes from the document's DTD.

       --nomkdir
           Refuses to create directories.

       --nonet
           Do not use the Internet to fetch DTDs, entities or documents.

       --noout
           Do not output the result.

       --novalid
           Skip loading the document's DTD.

       --nowrite
           Refuses to write to any file or resource.

       -o or --output FILE | DIRECTORY
           Direct output to the given FILE. Using the option with a DIRECTORY
           directs the output files to the specified directory. This can be
           useful for multiple outputs (also known as "chunking") or manpage
           processing.

               Important
               The given directory must already exist.

               Note
               Make sure that FILE and DIRECTORY follow the “URI reference
               computation” as described in RFC 2396 and laters. This means,
               that e.g.  -o directory will maybe not work, but -o directory/
               will.

       --encoding ENCODING
           Allow to specify the encoding for the input.

       --param PARAMNAME PARAMVALUE
           Pass a parameter of name PARAMNAME and value PARAMVALUE to the
           stylesheet. You may pass multiple name/value pairs up to a maximum of
           32. If the value being passed is a string, you can use --stringparam
           instead, to avoid additional quote characters that appear in string
           expressions. Note: the XPath expression must be UTF-8 encoded.

       --path "PATH(S)"
           Use the (space- or colon-separated) list of filesystem paths
           specified by PATHS to load DTDs, entities or documents. Enclose
           space-separated lists by quotation marks.

       --profile or --norman
           Output profiling information detailing the amount of time spent in
           each part of the stylesheet. This is useful in optimizing stylesheet
           performance.

       --repeat
           Run the transformation 20 times. Used for timing tests.

       --stringparam PARAMNAME PARAMVALUE
           Pass a parameter of name PARAMNAME and value PARAMVALUE where
           PARAMVALUE is a string rather than a node identifier.  Note: The
           string must be UTF-8 encoded.

       --timing
           Display the time used for parsing the stylesheet, parsing the
           document and applying the stylesheet and saving the result. Displayed
           in milliseconds.

       -v or --verbose
           Output each step taken by xsltproc in processing the stylesheet and
           the document.

       -V or --version
           Show the version of libxml(3) and libxslt(3) used.

       --writesubtree PATH
           Allow file write only within the PATH subtree.

       --xinclude
           Process the input document using the XInclude specification. More
           details on this can be found in the XInclude specification:
           http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/

       --xincludestyle
           Process the stylesheet with XInclude.

ENVIRONMENT
       SGML_CATALOG_FILES
           SGML catalog behavior can be changed by redirecting queries to the
           user's own set of catalogs. This can be done by setting the
           SGML_CATALOG_FILES environment variable to a list of catalogs. An
           empty one should deactivate loading the default /etc/sgml/catalog
           catalog.

       XML_CATALOG_FILES
           XML catalog behavior can be changed by redirecting queries to the
           user's own set of catalogs. This can be done by setting the
           XML_CATALOG_FILES environment variable to a list of catalogs. An
           empty one should deactivate loading the default /etc/xml/catalog
           catalog.
