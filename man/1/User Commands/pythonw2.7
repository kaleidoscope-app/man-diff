PYTHONW(1)                   General Commands Manual                  PYTHONW(1)

NAME
     pythonw â€“ run python script allowing GUI

SYNOPSIS
     pythonw ...

DESCRIPTION
     pythonw is used to run python scripts that may display a graphical user
     interface (GUI).  Pass the same arguments to pythonw as you would to
     python(1).  For executable scripts, use pythonw in the "#!" line.

     Actually, since Python 2.5, the normal python also allows GUI access, so
     python and pythonw are now interchangeable.
