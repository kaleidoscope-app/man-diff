DOT_CLEAN(1)                 General Commands Manual                DOT_CLEAN(1)

NAME
     dot_clean â€“ Merge ._* files with corresponding native files.

SYNOPSIS
     dot_clean [-fmnsv] [--keep=[mostrecent|dotbar|native]] [dir ...]

DESCRIPTION
     For each dir, dot_clean recursively merges all ._* files with their
     corresponding native files according to the rules specified with the given
     arguments.  By default, if there is an attribute on the native file that is
     also present in the ._ file, the most recent attribute will be used.

     If no operands are given, a usage message is output.  If more than one
     directory is given, directories are merged in the order in which they are
     specified.

OPTIONS
     -f      Flat merge.  Do not recursively merge all directories in the given
             dir.  This is off by default.

     -h      Help. Prints verbose usage message.

     -m      Always delete dot underbar files.

     -n      Delete dot underbar file if there is no matching native file.

     -s      Follow symbolic links.  This will follow symbolic dot underbar
             files when they are found.

     -v      Print verbose output.

     --keep=mostrecent
             The default option.  If an attribute is associated with a data
             fork, use that.  Otherwise, use information stored in the
             AppleDouble file.  Note that the native fork's data is preferred
             even if the data in the AppleDouble file is newer.

     --keep=dotbar
             Always use information stored in the AppleDouble file, replacing
             any extended attributes associated with the native file.

     --keep=native
             Always use the information associated with the data fork, ignoring
             any AppleDouble files.

EXAMPLES
     The following is how to do an dot_clean merge on the mounted volume test,
     always using the dot underbar information.

           dot_clean --keep=dotbar /Volumes/test

DIAGNOSTICS
     The dot_clean utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

BUGS
     None known.
