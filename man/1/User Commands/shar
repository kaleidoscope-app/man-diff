SHAR(1)                      General Commands Manual                     SHAR(1)

NAME
     shar â€“ create a shell archive of files

SYNOPSIS
     shar file ...

DESCRIPTION
     The shar command writes a sh(1) shell script to the standard output which
     will recreate the file hierarchy specified by the command line operands.
     Directories will be recreated and must be specified before the files they
     contain (the find(1) utility does this correctly).

     The shar command is normally used for distributing files by ftp(1) or
     mail(1).

EXAMPLES
     To create a shell archive of the program ls(1) and mail it to Rick:

           cd ls
           shar `find . -print` | mail -s "ls source" rick

     To recreate the program directory:

           mkdir ls
           cd ls
           ...
           <delete header lines and examine mailed archive>
           ...
           sh archive

SEE ALSO
     compress(1), mail(1), tar(1), uuencode(1)

HISTORY
     The shar command appeared in 4.4BSD.

BUGS
     The shar command makes no provisions for special types of files or files
     containing magic characters.  The shar command cannot handle files without
     a newline ('\n') as the last character.

     It is easy to insert trojan horses into shar files.  It is strongly
     recommended that all shell archive files be examined before running them
     through sh(1).  Archives produced using this implementation of shar may be
     easily examined with the command:

           egrep -av '^[X#]' shar.file
