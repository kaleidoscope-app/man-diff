NAME
       perldgux - Perl under DG/UX.

SYNOPSIS
       One can read this document in the following formats:

               man perldgux
               view perl perldgux
               explorer perldgux.html
               info perldgux

       to list some (not all may be available simultaneously), or it may be read
       as is: as README.dgux.

DESCRIPTION
       Perl 5.7/8.x for DG/UX ix86 R4.20MU0x

BUILDING PERL ON DG/UX
   Non-threaded Perl on DG/UX
       Just run ./Configure script from the top directory.  Then give "make" to
       compile.

   Threaded Perl on DG/UX
       If you are using as compiler GCC-2.95.x rev(DG/UX) an easy solution for
       configuring perl in your DG/UX machine is to run the command:

       ./Configure -Dusethreads -Duseithreads -Dusedevel -des

       This will automatically accept all the defaults and in particular
       /usr/local/ as installation directory.  Note that GCC-2.95.x rev(DG/UX)
       knows the switch -pthread which allows it to link correctly DG/UX's
       -lthread library.

       If you want to change the installation directory or have a standard DG/UX
       with C compiler GCC-2.7.2.x then you have no choice than to do an
       interactive build by issuing the command:

       ./Configure -Dusethreads -Duseithreads

       In particular with GCC-2.7.2.x accept all the defaults and *watch* out
       for the message:

           Any additional ld flags (NOT including libraries)? [ -pthread]

       Instead of -pthread put here -lthread. CGCC-2.7.2.x that comes with the
       DG/UX OS does NOT know the -pthread switch. So your build will fail if
       you choose the defaults.  After configuration is done correctly give
       "make" to compile.

   Testing Perl on DG/UX
       Issuing a "make test" will run all the tests.  If the test
       lib/ftmp-security gives you as a result something like

           lib/ftmp-security....File::Temp::_gettemp:
           Parent directory (/tmp/) is not safe (sticky bit not set
           when world writable?) at lib/ftmp-security.t line 100

       don't panic and just set the sticky bit in your /tmp directory by doing
       the following as root:

       cd / chmod +t /tmp (=set the sticky bit to /tmp).

       Then rerun the tests. This time all must be OK.

   Installing the built perl on DG/UX
       Run the command "make install"
