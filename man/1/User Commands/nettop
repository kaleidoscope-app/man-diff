nettop(1)                    General Commands Manual                   nettop(1)

NAME
     nettop â€“ Display updated information about the network

SYNOPSIS
     nettop [-ncd] [-m <mode>] [-t <type>] [-s <seconds>]
            [-p <process-name|pid>] [-n] [-l <samples>] [-L <samples>] [-P]
            [-j|k|J <column-name[,column-name]...>]

DESCRIPTION
     The nettop program displays a list of sockets or routes. The counts for
     network structures are updated periodically. While the program is running
     the following keys may be used:

     q        Quit

     Up Arrow
              Scroll up

     Down Arrow
              Scroll down

     Right Arrow
              Scroll Right

     Left Arrow
              Scroll Left

     d        Toggle delta output

     r        Redraw screen

     x        Toggle human readable numbers

     e        Expand all

     c        Collapse all

     h        Bring up the help menu

     j        Bring up the column selection menu.  In this mode you can
              enable/disable columns and change their order.

     p        Bring up the process selection menu.  In this mode you can
              enable/disable processes for display.

     l        Change to logging mode, redisplay the current data, and quit.

OPTIONS
     A list of flags and their descriptions:

     -m <mode>
              Specify the mode. By default, nettop will monitor TCP and UDP
              sockets. The following modes are supported:

              tcp      Only TCP sockets will be monitored

              udp      Only UDP sockets will be monitored

              route    Instead of sockets, the routing table will be monitored

     -t <type>
              Specify the type of interface. By default, all interfaces will be
              monitored.  Multiple interface types may be specified.  The
              following types are supported:

              wifi     WiFi interfaces

              wired    Wired interfaces

              loopback
                       Loopback interfaces

              awdl     Apple Wireless Direct Link  interfaces

              expensive
                       Interfaces marked as "expensive", for example via hotspot

              undefined
                       Cases where the underlying socket is not associated with
                       an interface

              external
                       The combination of all defined non-loopback interfaces.

     -n       Disable address to name resolution

     -c       Less intensive use of the CPU - draws less often

     -d       Delta mode

     -x       Extended display of numbers instead of human readable suffixes
              such as MiB

     -P       Display per-process summary only, skipping details of open
              connections.  This is equivalent to selecting "Collapse All" in
              the interactive menu.

     -s <delay>
              Set the delay between updates to <delay> seconds.  The default
              delay between updates is 1 second.

     -l <samples>
              Use  logging  mode  and  display  <samples> samples, even if
              standard output is a terminal.  0 is treated as infinity.  Rather
              than redisplaying, output is periodically printed in raw form.

     -L <samples>
              Use  logging  mode  and  display  <samples> samples, even if
              standard output is a terminal.  Output will be in comma-separated
              values (CSV) form.  0 is treated as infinity.  Rather than
              redisplaying, output is periodically printed in raw form.

     -p <process-name|pid>
              Select a process for display.  A numeric argument identifies a
              process by its pid.  Alternatively a process name may be given, in
              which case all processes with that name will be displayed.  The
              name must be an exact match for the name displayed by nettop,
              which may require that the name be truncated, for example
              launchd.develop instead of launchd.development.  The option may be
              repeated to select multiple processes.

     -j <column name list>
              Specifiy a list of column headings to be included in the display.
              List items are separated by commas.  For example, -j uuid,rtt_var

     -J <column name list>
              Specifiy a list of column headings that are to be the only ones
              included in the display. List items are separated by commas.  For
              example, -j uuid,rtt_var.  The ordering is currently as per nettop
              default, but may change in future revisions to match the order of
              the supplied column names.  For future compatibility it is
              recommended that any names supplied here are given an order that
              matches the output.

     -k <column name list>
              Specifiy a list of column headings to be excluded from the
              display. List items are separated by commas.  For example, -k
              rcvsize,rtt_avg
