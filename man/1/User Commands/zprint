ZPRINT(1)                    General Commands Manual                   ZPRINT(1)

NAME
     zprint – show information about kernel zones

SYNOPSIS
     zprint [-cdhlLstw] [name]

DESCRIPTION
     zprint displays data about Mach zones (allocation buckets).  By default,
     zprint will print out information about all Mach zones.  If the optional
     name is specified, zprint will print information about each zone for which
     name is a substring of the zone's name.

     zprint interprets the following options:

     -c         (Default) zprint prints zone info in columns.  Long zone names
                are truncated with ‘$’, and spaces are replaced with ‘.’, to
                allow for sorting by column.  Pageable and collectible zones are
                shown with ‘P’ and ‘C’ on the far right, respectively.  Zones
                with preposterously large maximum sizes are shown with ‘----’ in
                the max size and max num elts fields.

     -d         Display deltas over time, showing any zones that have achieved a
                new maximum current allocation size during the interval.  If the
                total allocation sizes are being displayed for the zones in
                question, it will also display the deltas if the total
                allocations have doubled.

     -h         (Default) Shows headings for the columns printed with the -c
                option.  It may be useful to override this option when sorting
                by column.

     -l         (Default) Show all wired memory information after the zone
                information.

     -L         Do not show all wired memory information after the zone
                information.

     -s         zprint sorts the zones, showing the zone wasting the most memory
                first.

     -t         For each zone, zprint calculates the total size of allocations
                from the zone over the life of the zone.

     -w         For each zone, zprint calculates how much space is allocated but
                not currently in use, the space wasted by the zone.

     Any option (including default options) can be overridden by specifying the
     option in upper-case; for example, -C overrides the default option -c.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The zprint utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
