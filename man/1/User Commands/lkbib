LKBIB(1)                     General Commands Manual                    LKBIB(1)



NAME
       lkbib - search bibliographic databases

SYNOPSIS
       lkbib [ -v ] [ -ifields ] [ -pfilename ] [ -tn ] key...

       It is possible to have whitespace between a command line option and its
       parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       lkbib searches bibliographic databases for references that contain the
       keys key... and prints any references found on the standard output.
       lkbib will search any databases given by -p options, and then a default
       database.  The default database is taken from the REFER environment
       variable if it is set, otherwise it is /usr/dict/papers/Ind.  For each
       database filename to be searched, if an index filename.i created by
       indxbib(1) exists, then it will be searched instead; each index can cover
       multiple databases.

OPTIONS
       -v     Print the version number.

       -pfilename
              Search filename.  Multiple -p options can be used.

       -istring
              When searching files for which no index exists, ignore the
              contents of fields whose names are in string.

       -tn    Only require the first n characters of keys to be given.
              Initially n is 6.

ENVIRONMENT
       REFER
            Default database.

FILES
       /usr/dict/papers/Ind
              Default database to be used if the REFER environment variable is
              not set.
