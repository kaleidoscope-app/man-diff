NAME
     shazam custom-catalog export â€“ Export contents of a custom catalog file


SYNOPSIS
     shazam custom-catalog export [--input input] [--output output]




DESCRIPTION
     This command is used to export the contents of a custom catalog file to
     disk. Running it takes each signature and media items entry of a custom
     catalog file and writes it to disk. Signature entries are saved as
     .shazamsignature files and media items are saved as .csv files.


OPTIONS
     -i,--input input
             Path to an existing custom catalog file to be exported to disk.


     -o,--output output
             Path to a directory to export the contents of a custom catalog to.
             Signatures are exported as a .shazamsignature file having the ID of
             the signature as part of the exported file name. Media items are
             exported as a .csv file per shazam signature and have the same ID
             of the signature they are associated with as part of the exported
             file name.
