NAME
       perl5262delta - what is new for perl v5.26.2

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes differences between the 5.26.1 release and the
       5.26.2 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.26.0, first read
       perl5261delta, which describes differences between 5.26.0 and 5.26.1.

Security
   [CVE-2018-6797] heap-buffer-overflow (WRITE of size 1) in S_regatom
       (regcomp.c)
       A crafted regular expression could cause a heap buffer write overflow,
       with control over the bytes written.  [perl #132227]
       <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=132227>

   [CVE-2018-6798] Heap-buffer-overflow in Perl__byte_dump_string (utf8.c)
       Matching a crafted locale dependent regular expression could cause a heap
       buffer read overflow and potentially information disclosure.  [perl
       #132063] <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=132063>

   [CVE-2018-6913] heap-buffer-overflow in S_pack_rec
       "pack()" could cause a heap buffer write overflow with a large item
       count.  [perl #131844]
       <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131844>

   Assertion failure in Perl__core_swash_init (utf8.c)
       Control characters in a supposed Unicode property name could cause perl
       to crash.  This has been fixed.  [perl #132055]
       <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=132055> [perl #132553]
       <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=132553> [perl #132658]
       <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=132658>

Incompatible Changes
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.26.1.  If any
       exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report.  See
       "Reporting Bugs" below.

Modules and Pragmata
   Updated Modules and Pragmata
       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 5.20170922_26 to
           5.20180414_26.

       •   PerlIO::via has been upgraded from version 0.16 to 0.17.

       •   Term::ReadLine has been upgraded from version 1.16 to 1.17.

       •   Unicode::UCD has been upgraded from version 0.68 to 0.69.

Documentation
   Changes to Existing Documentation
       perluniprops

       •   This has been updated to note that "\p{Word}" now includes code
           points matching the "\p{Join_Control}" property.  The change to the
           property was made in Perl 5.18, but not documented until now.  There
           are currently only two code points that match this property: U+200C
           (ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER) and U+200D (ZERO WIDTH JOINER).

Platform Support
   Platform-Specific Notes
       Windows
           Visual C++ compiler version detection has been improved to work on
           non-English language systems.  [perl #132421]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=132421>

           We now set $Config{libpth} correctly for 64-bit builds using Visual
           C++ versions earlier than 14.1.  [perl #132484]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=132484>

Selected Bug Fixes
       •   The "readpipe()" built-in function now checks at compile time that it
           has only one parameter expression, and puts it in scalar context,
           thus ensuring that it doesn't corrupt the stack at runtime.  [perl
           #4574] <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=4574>

       •   Fixed a use after free bug in "pp_list" introduced in Perl 5.27.1.
           [perl #131954]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131954>

       •   Parsing a "sub" definition could cause a use after free if the "sub"
           keyword was followed by whitespace including newlines (and comments).
           [perl #131836]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131836>

       •   The tokenizer now correctly adjusts a parse pointer when skipping
           whitespace in an " ${identifier} " construct.  [perl #131949]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131949>

       •   Accesses to "${^LAST_FH}" no longer assert after using any of a
           variety of I/O operations on a non-glob.  [perl #128263]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128263>

       •   "sort" now performs correct reference counting when aliasing $a and
           $b, thus avoiding premature destruction and leakage of scalars if
           they are re-aliased during execution of the sort comparator.  [perl
           #92264] <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=92264>

       •   Some convoluted kinds of regexp no longer cause an arithmetic
           overflow when compiled.  [perl #131893]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131893>

       •   Fixed a duplicate symbol failure with -flto -mieee-fp builds.  pp.c
           defined "_LIB_VERSION" which -lieee already defines.  [perl #131786]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131786>

       •   A NULL pointer dereference in the "S_regmatch()" function has been
           fixed.  [perl #132017]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=132017>

       •   Failures while compiling code within other constructs, such as with
           string interpolation and the right part of "s///e" now cause
           compilation to abort earlier.

           Previously compilation could continue in order to report other
           errors, but the failed sub-parse could leave partly parsed constructs
           on the parser shift-reduce stack, confusing the parser, leading to
           perl crashes.  [perl #125351]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=125351>

Acknowledgements
       Perl 5.26.2 represents approximately 7 months of development since Perl
       5.26.1 and contains approximately 3,300 lines of changes across 82 files
       from 17 authors.

       Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there
       were approximately 1,800 lines of changes to 36 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant
       community of users and developers.  The following people are known to
       have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.26.2:

       Aaron Crane, Abigail, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, H.Merijn Brand, James E
       Keenan, Jarkko Hietaniemi, John SJ Anderson, Karen Etheridge, Karl
       Williamson, Lukas Mai, Renee Baecker, Sawyer X, Steve Hay, Todd Rinaldo,
       Tony Cook, Yves Orton, Zefram.

       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
       generated from version control history.  In particular, it does not
       include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
       modules included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN
       community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please
       see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.

Reporting Bugs
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug
       database at <https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
       <http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
       included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
       sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of "perl
       -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
       porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
       "SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec for details of
       how to report the issue.

Give Thanks
       If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl
       5, you can do so by running the "perlthanks" program:

           perlthanks

       This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of
       thanks.
