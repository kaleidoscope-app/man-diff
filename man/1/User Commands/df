NAME
     df – display free disk space

SYNOPSIS
     df [--libxo] [-b | -g | -H | -h | -k | -m | -P] [-acIilntY] [-,] [-T type]
        [file | filesystem ...]

LEGACY SYNOPSIS
     df [--libxo] [-b | -g | -H | -h | -k | -m | -P] [-acIilnY] [-,] [-T type]
     [-t type] [file | filesystem ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The df utility displays statistics about the amount of free disk space on
     the specified mounted file system or on the file system of which file is a
     part.  By default block counts are displayed with an assumed block size of
     512 bytes.  If neither a file or a file system operand is specified,
     statistics for all mounted file systems are displayed (subject to the -t
     option below).

     The following options are available:

     --libxo
             Generate output via libxo(3) in a selection of different human and
             machine readable formats.  See xo_parse_args(3) for details on
             command line arguments.

     -a      Show all mount points, including those that were mounted with the
             MNT_IGNORE flag.  This is implied for file systems specified on the
             command line.

     -b      Explicitly use 512 byte blocks, overriding any BLOCKSIZE
             specification from the environment.  This is the same as the -P
             option.  The -k option overrides this option.

     -c      Display a grand total.

     -g      Use 1073741824 byte (1 Gibibyte) blocks rather than the default.
             This overrides any BLOCKSIZE specification from the environment.

     -h      “Human-readable” output.  Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kibibyte,
             Mebibyte, Gibibyte, Tebibyte and Pebibyte (based on powers of 1024)
             in order to reduce the number of digits to four or fewer.  This
             applies to the Size, Used, and Avail columns only; the iused and
             ifree columns will be displayed in powers of 1000.

     -H, --si
             Same as -h but based on powers of 1000.

     -I      Suppress inode counts.  See -i below.

     -i      Include statistics on the number of free and used inodes.  In
             conjunction with the -h or -H options, the number of inodes is
             scaled by powers of 1000.  In case the filesystem has no inodes
             then ‘-’ is displayed instead of the usage percentage.

             This option is now the default to conform to Version 3 of the
             Single UNIX Specification (“SUSv3”).  Use -I to suppress this
             output.

     -k      Use 1024 byte (1 Kibibyte) blocks rather than the default.  This
             overrides the -P option and any BLOCKSIZE specification from the
             environment.

     -l      Select locally-mounted file system for display.  If used in
             combination with the -T type option, file system types will be
             added or excluded acccording to the parameters of that option.

     -m      Use 1048576 byte (1 Mebibyte) blocks rather than the default.  This
             overrides any BLOCKSIZE specification from the environment.

     -n      Print out the previously obtained statistics from the file systems.
             This option should be used if it is possible that one or more file
             systems are in a state such that they will not be able to provide
             statistics without a long delay.  When this option is specified, df
             will not request new statistics from the file systems, but will
             respond with the possibly stale statistics that were previously
             obtained.

     -P      Explicitly use 512 byte blocks, overriding any BLOCKSIZE
             specification from the environment.  This is the same as the -b
             option.  The -g and -k options override this option.  In
             compatibility mode, this also suppresses inode counts.

     -T type
             Select file systems to display.  More than one type may be
             specified in a comma separated list.  The list of file system types
             can be prefixed with “no” to specify the file system types for
             which action should not be taken.  If used in combination with the
             -l option, the parameters of this option will modify the list of
             locally-mounted file systems selected by the -l option.  For
             example, the df command:

                   df -T nonfs,mfs

             lists all file systems except those of type NFS and MFS.  The
             lsvfs(1) command can be used to find out the types of file systems
             that are available on the system.

     -t      If used with no arguments, this option is a no-op (macOS already
             prints the total allocated-space figures).  If used with an
             argument, it acts like -T, but this usage is deprecated and should
             not be relied upon.

     -Y      Include file system type.

     -,      (Comma) Print sizes grouped and separated by thousands using the
             non-monetary separator returned by localeconv(3), typically a comma
             or period.  If no locale is set, or the locale does not have a non-
             monetary separator, this option has no effect.

ENVIRONMENT
     BLOCKSIZE  Specifies the units in which to report block counts.  This uses
                getbsize(3), which allows units of bytes or numbers scaled with
                the letters k (for multiples of 1024 bytes), m (for multiples of
                1048576 bytes) or g (for gibibytes).  The allowed range is 512
                bytes to 1 GB.  If the value is outside, it will be set to the
                appropriate limit.

EXAMPLES
     Show human readable free disk space for all mount points including file
     system type:

           $ df -ahY
           Filesystem     Type      Size    Used   Avail Capacity iused ifree %iused  Mounted on
           /dev/disk1s5s1 apfs     465Gi    15Gi   266Gi     6%    533k  2.8G    0%   /
           devfs          devfs    194Ki   194Ki     0Bi   100%     672     0  100%   /dev
           /dev/disk1s2   apfs     465Gi   3.4Gi   266Gi     2%    1.6k  2.8G    0%   /System/Volumes/Preboot
           /dev/disk1s4   apfs     465Gi   3.0Gi   266Gi     2%       3  2.8G    0%   /System/Volumes/VM
           /dev/disk1s6   apfs     465Gi    11Mi   266Gi     1%      33  2.8G    0%   /System/Volumes/Update
           /dev/disk1s1   apfs     465Gi   177Gi   266Gi    40%    3.9M  2.8G    0%   /System/Volumes/Data

     The filesystems on this machine are virtual volumes on a single partition.
     Therefore, the size and space available is the same for all filesystems
     even though the space in use is different.  The capacity column shows the
     amount of space used by each filesystem as a percentage of the sum of space
     used and space available.

     Show previously collected data, excluding inode information, except for the
     devfs file system.  Note that the “no” prefix affects all the file systems
     in the list and the -t option can be specified only once:

           $ df -l -I -n -t nodevfs
           Filesystem     1K-blocks      Used Available Capacity  Mounted on
           /dev/disk1s5s1 487196712  15300072 278432984     6%    /
           /dev/disk1s2   487196712   3604640 278430312     2%    /System/Volumes/Preboot
           /dev/disk1s4   487196712   3145748 278430312     2%    /System/Volumes/VM
           /dev/disk1s6   487196712     11576 278430312     1%    /System/Volumes/Update
           /dev/disk1s1   487196712 185371244 278432984    40%    /System/Volumes/Data

     Show human readable information for the file system containing the file
     /etc/rc.common:

           $ df -h /etc/rc.common
           Filesystem      Size    Used   Avail Capacity iused ifree %iused  Mounted on
           /dev/disk1s1   465Gi   177Gi   266Gi    40%    3.9M  2.8G    0%   /System/Volumes/Data

     Same as above but specifying some file system:

           $ df -h /dev/disk1s1
           Filesystem      Size    Used   Avail Capacity iused ifree %iused  Mounted on
           /dev/disk1s1   465Gi   177Gi   266Gi    40%    3.9M  2.8G    0%   /System/Volumes/Data

LEGACY DESCRIPTION
     The "capacity" percentage is normally rounded up to the next higher
     integer.  In legacy mode, it is rounded down to the next lower integer.

     When the -P option and the -k option are used together, sizes are reported
     in 1024-byte blocks.

     The -t option is normally a no-op (macOS already prints the total
     allocated-space figures).  In legacy mode, it is equivalent to -T.

     For more information about legacy mode, see compat(5).

STANDARDS
     With the exception of most options, the df utility conforms to IEEE Std
     1003.1-2004 (“POSIX.1”), which defines only the -k, -P and -t options.

HISTORY
     A df command appeared in Version 1 AT&T UNIX.

BUGS
     The -n flag is ignored if a file or file system is specified.  Also, if a
     mount point is not accessible by the user, it is possible that the file
     system information could be stale.

     The -b and -P options are identical.  The former comes from the BSD
     tradition, and the latter is required for IEEE Std 1003.1-2004 (“POSIX.1”)
     conformity.
