XCODE-SELECT(1)            BSD General Commands Manual           XCODE-SELECT(1)



NAME
       xcode-select - Manages the active developer directory for Xcode and BSD
       tools.

SYNOPSIS
       xcode-select [-h|--help] [-s|--switch <path>] [-p|--print-path]
       [-v|--version]

DESCRIPTION
       xcode-select controls the location of the developer directory used by
       xcrun(1), xcodebuild(1), cc(1), and other Xcode and BSD development
       tools. This also controls the locations that are searched for by man(1)
       for developer tool manpages.

       This allows you to easily switch between different versions of the Xcode
       tools and can be used to update the path to the Xcode if it is moved
       after installation.

   Usage
       When multiple Xcode applications are installed on a system (e.g.
       /Applications/Xcode.app, containing the latest Xcode, and
       /Applications/Xcode-beta.app containing a beta) use xcode-select --switch
       path/to/Xcode.app to specify the Xcode that you wish to use for command
       line developer tools.

       After setting a developer directory, all of the xcode-select provided
       developer tool shims (see FILES) will automatically invoke the version of
       the tool inside the selected developer directory. Your own scripts,
       makefiles, and other tools can also use xcrun(1) to easily lookup tools
       inside the active developer directory, making it easy to switch them
       between different versions of the Xcode tools and allowing them to
       function properly on systems where the Xcode application has been
       installed to a non-default location.

OPTIONS

       -h, --help
              Prints the usage message.

       -s <path>, --switch <path>
              Sets the active developer directory to the given path, for example
              /Applications/Xcode-beta.app. This command must be run with
              superuser permissions (see sudo(8)), and will affect all users on
              the system. To set the path without superuser permissions or only
              for the current shell session, use the DEVELOPER_DIR environment
              variable instead (see ENVIRONMENT).

       -p, --print-path
              Prints the path to the currently selected developer directory.
              This is useful for inspection, but scripts and other tools should
              use xcrun(1) to locate tool inside the active developer directory.

       -r, --reset
              Unsets any user-specified developer directory, so that the
              developer directory will be found via the default search
              mechanism. This command must be run with superuser permissions
              (see sudo(8)), and will affect all users on the system.

       -v, --version
              Prints xcode-select version information.

       --install
              Opens a user interface dialog to request automatic installation of
              the command line developer tools.

ENVIRONMENT
       DEVELOPER_DIR
          Overrides the active developer directory. When DEVELOPER_DIR is set,
          its value will be used instead of the system-wide active developer
          directory.

          Note that for historical reason, the developer directory is considered
          to be the Developer content directory inside the Xcode application
          (for example /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer). You can set
          the environment variable to either the actual Developer contents
          directory, or the Xcode application directory -- the xcode-select
          provided shims will automatically convert the environment variable
          into the full Developer content path.

EXAMPLES
       xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
          Select /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer as the active
          developer directory.

       xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app
          As above, selects /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer as the
          active developer directory. The Developer content directory is
          automatically inferred by xcode-select.

       /usr/bin/xcodebuild
          Runs xcodebuild out of the active developer directory.

       /usr/bin/xcrun --find xcodebuild
          Use xcrun to locate xcodebuild inside the active developer directory.

       env DEVELOPER_DIR="/Applications/Xcode-beta.app" /usr/bin/xcodebuild
          Execute xcodebuild using an alternate developer directory.

FILES
       /usr/bin/xcrun
          Used to find or run arbitrary commands from the active developer
          directory. See xcrun(1) for more information.
