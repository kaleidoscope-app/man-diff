LOOKBIB(1)                   General Commands Manual                  LOOKBIB(1)



NAME
       lookbib - search bibliographic databases

SYNOPSIS
       lookbib [ -v ] [ -istring ] [ -tn ] filename...

       It is possible to have whitespace between a command line option and its
       parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       lookbib prints a prompt on the standard error (unless the standard input
       is not a terminal), reads from the standard input a line containing a set
       of keywords, searches the bibliographic databases filename... for
       references containing those keywords, prints any references found on the
       standard output, and repeats this process until the end of input.  For
       each database filename to be searched, if an index filename.i created by
       indxbib(1) exists, then it will be searched instead; each index can cover
       multiple databases.

OPTIONS
       -v     Print the version number.

       -istring
              When searching files for which no index exists, ignore the
              contents of fields whose names are in string.

       -tn    Only require the first n characters of keys to be given.
              Initially n is 6.

FILES
       filename.i
                 Index files.
