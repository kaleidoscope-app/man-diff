uuto(1)                      General Commands Manual                     uuto(1)



NAME
       uuto - send files to a particular user on a remote system

SYNOPSIS
       uuto files... system!user

DESCRIPTION
       The uuto program may be used to conveniently send files to a particular
       user on a remote system.  It will arrange for mail to be sent to the
       remote user when the files arrive on the remote system, and he or she may
       easily retrieve the files using the uupick program.  Note that uuto does
       not provide any security--any user on the remote system can examine the
       files.

       The last argument specifies the system and user name to which to send the
       files.  The other arguments are the files or directories to be sent.

       The uuto program is actually just a trivial shell script which invokes
       the uucp program with the appropriate arguments.

OPTIONS
       Any option which may be given to uucp may also be given to uuto.

SEE ALSO
       uucp(1), uupick(1)
