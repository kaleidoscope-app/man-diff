SOELIM(1)                    General Commands Manual                   SOELIM(1)



NAME
       soelim - interpret .so requests in groff input

SYNOPSIS
       soelim [ -Crtv ] [ -Idir ] [ files... ]

       It is possible to have whitespace between the -I command line option and
       its parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       soelim reads files and replaces lines of the form

              .so file

       by the contents of file.  It is useful if files included with so need to
       be preprocessed.  Normally, soelim should be invoked with the -s option
       of groff.

       Note that there must be no whitespace between the leading dot and the two
       characters `s' and `o'.  Otherwise, only groff interprets the .so request
       (and soelim ignores it).

OPTIONS
       -C     Recognize .so even when followed by a character other than space
              or newline.

       -Idir  This option may be used to specify a directory to search for files
              (both those on the command line and those named in .so requests).
              The current directory is always searched first.  This option may
              be specified more than once, the directories will be searched in
              the order specified.  No directory search is performed for files
              specified using an absolute path.

       -r     Do not add .lf requests (for general use, with non-groff files).

       -t     Don't emit .lf requests but TeX comment lines (starting with `%')
              giving the current file and line number.

       -v     Print the version number.

USAGE
       The normal processing sequence of groff is this:

                 input        sourced
                 file          file
                   |             |
                   v             v
               preprocessor -> troff -> postprocessor
                                             |
                                             v
                                          output
                                           file

       That is, files sourced with .so are normally read only by troff (the
       actual formatter).  soelim is not required for troff to source files.

       If a file to be sourced should also be preprocessed, it must already be
       read before the input file passes through the preprocessor.  This is
       handled by soelim:

                 input
                 file
                   |
                   v
                 soelim -> preprocessor -> troff -> postprocessor
                   ^                                     |
                   |                                     v
                sourced                               output
                 file                                  file
