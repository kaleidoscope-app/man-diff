POSTDROP(1)                  General Commands Manual                 POSTDROP(1)




NAME
       postdrop - Postfix mail posting utility

SYNOPSIS
       postdrop [-rv] [-c config_dir]

DESCRIPTION
       The postdrop(1) command creates a file in the maildrop directory and
       copies its standard input to the file.

       Options:

       -c config_dir
              The main.cf configuration file is in the named directory instead
              of the default configuration directory. See also the MAIL_CONFIG
              environment setting below.

       -r     Use a Postfix-internal protocol for reading the message from
              standard input, and for reporting status information on standard
              output. This is currently the only supported method.

       -v     Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple -v options
              make the software increasingly verbose. As of Postfix 2.3, this
              option is available for the super-user only.

SECURITY
       The command is designed to run with set-group ID privileges, so that it
       can write to the maildrop queue directory and so that it can connect to
       Postfix daemon processes.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Fatal errors: malformed input, I/O error, out of memory. Problems are
       logged to syslogd(8) and to the standard error stream.  When the input is
       incomplete, or when the process receives a HUP, INT, QUIT or TERM signal,
       the queue file is deleted.

ENVIRONMENT

       MAIL_CONFIG
              Directory with the main.cf file. In order to avoid exploitation of
              set-group ID privileges, a non-standard directory is allowed only
              if:

              •      The name is listed in the standard main.cf file with the
                     alternate_config_directories configuration parameter.

              •      The command is invoked by the super-user.

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
       The following main.cf parameters are especially relevant to this program.
       The text below provides only a parameter summary. See postconf(5) for
       more details including examples.

       alternate_config_directories (empty)
              A list of non-default Postfix configuration directories that may
              be specified with "-c config_directory" on the command line, or
              via the MAIL_CONFIG environment parameter.

       config_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)
              The default location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf
              configuration files.

       import_environment (see 'postconf -d' output)
              The list of environment parameters that a Postfix process will
              import from a non-Postfix parent process.

       queue_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)
              The location of the Postfix top-level queue directory.

       syslog_facility (mail)
              The syslog facility of Postfix logging.

       syslog_name (see 'postconf -d' output)
              A prefix that is prepended to the process name in syslog records,
              so that, for example, "smtpd" becomes "prefix/smtpd".

       trigger_timeout (10s)
              The time limit for sending a trigger to a Postfix daemon (for
              example, the pickup(8) or qmgr(8) daemon).

       Available in Postfix version 2.2 and later:

       authorized_submit_users (static:anyone)
              List of users who are authorized to submit mail with the
              sendmail(1) command (and with the privileged postdrop(1) helper
              command).

FILES
       /var/spool/postfix/maildrop, maildrop queue
