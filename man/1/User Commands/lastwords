lastwords(1m)                     USER COMMANDS                    lastwords(1m)



NAME
       lastwords - print syscalls before exit. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       lastwords command

DESCRIPTION
       This prints the last few system calls for processes matching the given
       name, when they exit. This makes use of a ring buffer so that the impact
       on the system is minimised.

       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       Catch last few syscalls for dying netscape processes,
              # lastwords netscape

FIELDS
       TIME   time of syscall return, ns

       PID    process ID

       EXEC   process name (execname)

       SYSCALL
              system call

       RETURN return value for the system call

       ERR    errno for the system call

BASED ON
       /usr/demo/dtrace/ring.d
