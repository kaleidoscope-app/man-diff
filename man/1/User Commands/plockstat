PLOCKSTAT(1)                                                        PLOCKSTAT(1)



NAME
       plockstat - front-end to DTrace to print statistics about POSIX mutexes
       and read/write locks

SYNOPSIS
       plockstat [-vACHV] [-n count] [-s depth] [-e secs] [-x opt[=val]]
       command [arg...]

       plockstat [-vACHV] [-n count] [-s depth] [-e secs] [-x opt[=val]]
       -p pid

OVERVIEW
       The plockstat command is a front-end to DTrace that can be used to print
       statistics about POSIX mutexes and read/write locks.

       Since OS X 10.11, in order to use this, your process must be run with
       DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH set to contain /usr/lib/system/introspection:

               DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/system/introspection

       Which contains the necessary static DTrace probes.


OPTIONS
       -v     print a message when tracing starts

       -A     trace contention and hold events (same as -CH)

       -C     trace contention events for mutexes and rwlocks

       -H     trace hold events for mutexes and rwlocks

       -V     print the dtrace script to run

       -n count
              display only 'count' entries for each event type

       -s depth
              show stack trace upto 'depth' entries

       -e secs
              exit after specified seconds

       -x arg[=val]
              enable a DTrace runtime option or a D compiler option

       -p pid attach and trace the specified process id
