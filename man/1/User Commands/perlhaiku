PERLHAIKU(1)            Perl Programmers Reference Guide            PERLHAIKU(1)




NAME
       perlhaiku - Perl version 5.10+ on Haiku

DESCRIPTION
       This file contains instructions how to build Perl for Haiku and lists
       known problems.

BUILD AND INSTALL
       The build procedure is completely standard:

         ./Configure -de
         make
         make install

       Make perl executable and create a symlink for libperl:

         chmod a+x /boot/common/bin/perl
         cd /boot/common/lib; ln -s perl5/5.30.3/BePC-haiku/CORE/libperl.so .

       Replace 5.30.3 with your respective version of Perl.

KNOWN PROBLEMS
       The following problems are encountered with Haiku revision 28311:

       •   Perl cannot be compiled with threading support ATM.

       •   The cpan/Socket/t/socketpair.t test fails. More precisely: the
           subtests using datagram sockets fail. Unix datagram sockets aren't
           implemented in Haiku yet.

       •   A subtest of the cpan/Sys-Syslog/t/syslog.t test fails. This is due
           to Haiku not implementing /dev/log support yet.

       •   The tests dist/Net-Ping/t/450_service.t and
           dist/Net-Ping/t/510_ping_udp.t fail. This is due to bugs in Haiku's
           network stack implementation.

CONTACT
       For Haiku specific problems contact the HaikuPorts developers:
       <http://ports.haiku-files.org/>

       The initial Haiku port was done by Ingo Weinhold <ingo_weinhold@gmx.de>.
