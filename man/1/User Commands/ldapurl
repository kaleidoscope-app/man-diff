LDAPURL(1)                   General Commands Manual                  LDAPURL(1)



NAME
       ldapurl - LDAP URL formatting tool

SYNOPSIS
       ldapurl [-a attrs] [-b_searchbase] [-e [!]ext[=extparam]]
       [-E [!]ext[=extparam]] [-f_filter] [-H_ldapuri] [-h_ldaphost]
       [-p_ldapport] [-s {base|one|sub|children}] [-S_scheme]

DESCRIPTION
       ldapurl is a command that allows to either compose or decompose LDAP
       URIs.

       When invoked with the -H option, ldapurl extracts the components of the
       ldapuri option argument, unescaping hex-escaped chars as required.  It
       basically acts as a frontend to the ldap_url_parse(3) call.  Otherwise,
       it builds an LDAP URI based on the components passed with the appropriate
       options, performing the inverse operation.  Option -H is incompatible
       with options -a, -b, -E, -f, -H, -h, -p, -S, and -s.

OPTIONS
       -a_attrs
              Set a comma-separated list of attribute selectors.

       -b_searchbase
              Set the searchbase.

       -e [!]ext[=extparam]

       -E [!]ext[=extparam]

              Specify general extensions with -e and search extensions with -E.
              ´!´ indicates criticality.

              General extensions:
                [!]assert=<filter>   (an RFC 4515 Filter)
                [!]authzid=<authzid> ("dn:<dn>" or "u:<user>")
                [!]manageDSAit
                [!]noop
                ppolicy
                [!]postread[=<attrs>]        (a comma-separated attribute list)
                [!]preread[=<attrs>] (a comma-separated attribute list)
                abandon, cancel (SIGINT sends abandon/cancel; not really controls)

              Search extensions:
                [!]domainScope                               (domain scope)
                [!]mv=<filter>                               (matched values filter)
                [!]pr=<size>[/prompt|noprompt]       (paged results/prompt)
                [!]sss=[-]<attr[:OID]>[/[-]<attr[:OID]>...]  (server side sorting)
                [!]subentries[=true|false]           (subentries)
                [!]sync=ro[/<cookie>]                        (LDAP Sync refreshOnly)
                        rp[/<cookie>][/<slimit>]     (LDAP Sync refreshAndPersist)

       -f_filter
              Set the URL filter.  No particular check on conformity with RFC
              4515 LDAP filters is performed, but the value is hex-escaped as
              required.

       -H_ldapuri
              Specify URI to be exploded.

       -h_ldaphost
              Set the host.

       -p_ldapport
              Set the TCP port.

       -S_scheme
              Set the URL scheme.  Defaults for other fields, like ldapport, may
              depend on the value of scheme.

       -s {base|one|sub|children}
              Specify the scope of the search to be one of base, one, sub, or
              children to specify a base object, one-level, subtree, or children
              search.  The default is sub.  Note: children scope requires LDAPv3
              subordinate feature extension.


OUTPUT FORMAT
       If the -H option is used, the ldapuri supplied is exploded in its
       components, which are printed to standard output in an LDIF-like form.

       Otherwise, the URI built using the values passed with the other options
       is printed to standard output.

EXAMPLE
       The following command:

           ldapuri -h ldap.example.com -b dc=example,dc=com -s sub -f "(cn=Some One)"

       returns

           ldap://ldap.example.com:389/dc=example,dc=com??sub?(cn=Some%20One)

       The command:

           ldapuri -H ldap://ldap.example.com:389/dc=example,dc=com??sub?(cn=Some%20One)

       returns

           scheme: ldap
           host: ldap.example.com
           port: 389
           dn: dc=example,dc=com
           scope: sub
           filter: (cn=Some One)

DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit status is zero if no errors occur.  Errors result in a non-zero exit
       status and a diagnostic message being written to standard error.
