NAME
       perlexperiment - A listing of experimental features in Perl

DESCRIPTION
       This document lists the current and past experimental features in the
       perl core. Although all of these are documented with their appropriate
       topics, this succinct listing gives you an overview and basic facts about
       their status.

       So far we've merely tried to find and list the experimental features and
       infer their inception, versions, etc. There's a lot of speculation here.

   Accepted features
       These features were so wildly successful and played so well with others
       that we decided to remove their experimental status and admit them as
       full, stable features in the world of Perl, lavishing all the benefits
       and luxuries thereof.  They are also awarded +5 Stability and +3
       Charisma.

       The "\N" regex character class
               The "\N" character class, not to be confused with the named

   Removed features
       These features are no longer considered experimental and their
       functionality has disappeared. It's your own fault if you wrote
       production programs using these features after we explicitly told you not
       to (see perlpolicy).

       "legacy"
               The experimental "legacy" pragma was swallowed by the "feature"
               pragma.
