FOLD(1)                      General Commands Manual                     FOLD(1)

NAME
     fold – fold long lines for finite width output device

SYNOPSIS
     fold [-bs] [-w width] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The fold utility is a filter which folds the contents of the specified
     files, or the standard input if no files are specified, breaking the lines
     to have a maximum of 80 columns.

     The options are as follows:

     -b      Count width in bytes rather than column positions.

     -s      Fold line after the last blank character within the first width
             column positions (or bytes).

     -w width
             Specify a line width to use instead of the default 80 columns.
             Width should be a multiple of 8 if tabs are present, or the tabs
             should be expanded using expand(1) before using fold.

ENVIRONMENT
     The LANG, LC_ALL and LC_CTYPE environment variables affect the execution of
     fold as described in environ(7).

SEE ALSO
     expand(1), fmt(1)

STANDARDS
     The fold utility conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”).

BUGS
     If underlining is present it may be messed up by folding.
