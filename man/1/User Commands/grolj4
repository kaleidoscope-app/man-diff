GROLJ4(1)                    General Commands Manual                   GROLJ4(1)



NAME
       grolj4 - groff driver for HP Laserjet 4 family

SYNOPSIS
grolj4 [ -lv ] [ -d[n] ] [ -cn ] [ -ppaper_size ] [ -wn ] [ -Fdir ] [ files... ]

       It is possible to have whitespace between a command line option and its
       parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       grolj4 is a driver for groff that produces output in PCL5 format suitable
       for an HP Laserjet 4 printer.

       There is an additional drawing command available:

       \D'R dh_dv'
              Draw a rule (solid black rectangle), with one corner at the
              current position, and the diagonally opposite corner at the
              current position +(dh,dv).  Afterwards the current position will
              be at the opposite corner.  This generates a PCL fill rectangle
              command, and so will work on printers that do not support HPGL/2
              unlike the other \D commands.

OPTIONS
       -cn    Print n copies of each page.

       -l     Print the document with a landscape orientation.

       -d [n] Use duplex mode n: 1 is long-side binding; 2 is short-side
              binding; default is 1.

       -psize Set the paper size to size, which must be one of letter, legal,
              executive, a4, com10, monarch, c5, b5, dl.

       -v     Print the version number.

       -wn    Set the default line thickness to n thousandths of an em.  If this
              option isn't specified, the line thickness defaults to 0.04 em.

       -Fdir  Prepend directory dir/devname to the search path for font and
              device description files; name is the name of the device, usually
              lj4.

       The following four commands are available additionally in the font
       description files:

       pclweight_N
              The integer value N must be in the range -7 to +7; default is 0.

       pclstyle_N
