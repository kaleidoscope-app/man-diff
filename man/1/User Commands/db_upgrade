db_upgrade(1)                General Commands Manual               db_upgrade(1)

NAME
     db_upgrade

SYNOPSIS
     db_upgrade [-NsV] [-h home] [-P password] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     The db_upgrade utility upgrades the Berkeley DB version of one or more
     files and the databases they contain to the current release version.

     The options are as follows:

     -h
       Specify a home directory for the database environment; by default, the
       current working directory is used.

     -N
       Do not acquire shared region mutexes while running. Other problems, such
       as potentially fatal errors in Berkeley DB, will be ignored as well. This
       option is intended only for debugging errors, and should not be used
       under any other circumstances.

     -P
       Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite
       password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a window of
       vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see command-line
       arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory
       containing the command-line arguments.

     -s
       This flag is only meaningful when upgrading databases from releases
       before the Berkeley DB 3.1 release.

       As part of the upgrade from the Berkeley DB 3.0 release to the 3.1
       release, the on-disk format of duplicate data items changed. To correctly
       upgrade the format requires that applications specify whether duplicate
       data items in the database are sorted or not. Specifying the -s flag
       means that the duplicates are sorted; otherwise, they are assumed to be
       unsorted. Incorrectly specifying the value of this flag may lead to
       database corruption.

       Because the db_upgrade utility upgrades a physical file (including all
       the databases it contains), it is not possible to use db_upgrade to
       upgrade files where some of the databases it includes have sorted
       duplicate data items, and some of the databases it includes have unsorted
       duplicate data items. If the file does not have more than a single
       database, if the databases do not support duplicate data items, or if all
       the databases that support duplicate data items support the same style of
       duplicates (either sorted or unsorted), db_upgrade will work correctly as
       long as the -s flag is correctly specified. Otherwise, the file cannot be
       upgraded using db_upgrade, and must be upgraded manually using the
       db_dump and db_load utilities.

     -V
       Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

     It is important to realize that Berkeley DB database upgrades are done in
     place, and so are potentially destructive. This means that if the system
     crashes during the upgrade procedure, or if the upgrade procedure runs out
     of disk space, the databases may be left in an inconsistent and
     unrecoverable state. See Upgrading databases for more information.

     The db_upgrade utility may be used with a Berkeley DB environment (as
     described for the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because
     the utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment).
     In order to avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB
     environment, db_upgrade should always be given the chance to detach from
     the environment and exit gracefully. To cause db_upgrade to release all
     environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal
     (SIGINT).

     The db_upgrade utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

ENVIRONMENT
     DB_HOME  If the -h option is not specified and the environment variable
              DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as
              described in DB_ENV->open.
