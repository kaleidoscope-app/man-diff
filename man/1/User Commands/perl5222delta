NAME
       perl5222delta - what is new for perl v5.22.2

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes differences between the 5.22.1 release and the
       5.22.2 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.22.0, first read
       perl5221delta, which describes differences between 5.22.0 and 5.22.1.

Security
   Fix out of boundary access in Win32 path handling
       This is CVE-2015-8608.  For more information see [perl #126755]
       <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126755>.

   Fix loss of taint in "canonpath()"
       This is CVE-2015-8607.  For more information see [perl #126862]
       <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126862>.

   Set proper umask before calling mkstemp(3)
       In 5.22.0 perl started setting umask to 0600 before calling mkstemp(3)
       and restoring it afterwards.  This wrongfully tells open(2) to strip the
       owner read and write bits from the given mode before applying it, rather
       than the intended negation of leaving only those bits in place.

       Systems that use mode 0666 in mkstemp(3) (like old versions of glibc)
       create a file with permissions 0066, leaving world read and write
       permissions regardless of current umask.

       This has been fixed by using umask 0177 instead.

       [perl #127322] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127322>

   Avoid accessing uninitialized memory in Win32 "crypt()"
       Validation that will detect both a short salt and invalid characters in
       the salt has been added.

       [perl #126922] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126922>

   Remove duplicate environment variables from "environ"
       Previously, if an environment variable appeared more than once in
       "environ[]", %ENV would contain the last entry for that name, while a
       typical "getenv()" would return the first entry.  We now make sure %ENV
       contains the same as what "getenv()" returns.

       Secondly, we now remove duplicates from "environ[]", so if a setting with
       that name is set in %ENV we won't pass an unsafe value to a child
       process.

       This is CVE-2016-2381.

Incompatible Changes
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with Perl 5.22.1.  If any
       exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report.  See
       "Reporting Bugs" below.

Modules and Pragmata
   Updated Modules and Pragmata
       •   File::Spec has been upgraded from version 3.56 to 3.56_01.

           "canonpath()" now preserves taint.  See "Fix loss of taint in
           "canonpath()"".

       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 5.20151213 to
           5.20160429.

           The version number of Digest::SHA listed for Perl 5.18.4 was wrong
           and has been corrected.  Likewise for the version number of Config in
           5.18.3 and 5.18.4.  [perl #127624]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127624>

Documentation
   Changes to Existing Documentation
       perldiag

       •   The explanation of the warning "unable to close filehandle %s
           properly: %s" which can occur when doing an implicit close of a
           filehandle has been expanded and improved.

       perlfunc

       •   The documentation of "hex()" has been revised to clarify valid
           inputs.

Configuration and Compilation
       •   Dtrace builds now build successfully on systems with a newer dtrace
           that require an input object file that uses the probes in the .d
           file.

           Previously the probe would fail and cause a build failure.

           [perl #122287] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122287>

       •   Configure no longer probes for libnm by default.  Originally this was
           the "New Math" library, but the name has been re-used by the GNOME
           NetworkManager.

           [perl #127131] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127131>

       •   Configure now knows about gcc 5.

       •   Compiling perl with -DPERL_MEM_LOG now works again.

Platform Support
   Platform-Specific Notes
       Darwin
           Compiling perl with -Dusecbacktrace on Darwin now works again.

           [perl #127764] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127764>

       OS X/Darwin
           Builds with both -DDEBUGGING and threading enabled would fail with a
           "panic: free from wrong pool" error when built or tested from
           Terminal on OS X.  This was caused by perl's internal management of
           the environment conflicting with an atfork handler using the libc
           "setenv()" function to update the environment.

           Perl now uses "setenv()"/"unsetenv()" to update the environment on OS
           X.

           [perl #126240] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126240>

       ppc64el
           The floating point format of ppc64el (Debian naming for little-endian
           PowerPC) is now detected correctly.

       Tru64
           A test failure in t/porting/extrefs.t has been fixed.

Internal Changes
       •   An unwarranted assertion in "Perl_newATTRSUB_x()" has been removed.
           If a stub subroutine definition with a prototype has been seen, then
           any subsequent stub (or definition) of the same subroutine with an
           attribute was causing an assertion failure because of a null pointer.

           [perl #126845] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126845>

Selected Bug Fixes
       •   Calls to the placeholder &PL_sv_yes used internally when an
           "import()" or "unimport()" method isn't found now correctly handle
           scalar context.  [perl #126042]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126042>

       •   The "pipe()" operator would assert for "DEBUGGING" builds instead of
           producing the correct error message.  The condition asserted on is
           detected and reported on correctly without the assertions, so the
           assertions were removed.  [perl #126480]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126480>

       •   In some cases, failing to parse a here-doc would attempt to use freed
           memory.  This was caused by a pointer not being restored correctly.
           [perl #126443] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126443>

       •   Perl now reports more context when it sees an array where it expects
           to see an operator, and avoids an assertion failure.  [perl #123737]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123737>

       •   If a here-doc was found while parsing another operator, the parser
           had already read end of file, and the here-doc was not terminated,
           perl could produce an assertion or a segmentation fault.  This now
           reliably complains about the unterminated here-doc.  [perl #125540]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125540>

       •   Parsing beyond the end of the buffer when processing a "#line"
           directive with no filename is now avoided.  [perl #127334]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127334>

       •   Perl 5.22.0 added support for the C99 hexadecimal floating point
           notation, but sometimes misparsed hex floats.  This has been fixed.
           [perl #127183] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127183>

       •   Certain regex patterns involving a complemented posix class in an
           inverted bracketed character class, and matching something else
           optionally would improperly fail to match.  An example of one that
           could fail is "qr/_?[^\Wbar]\x{100}/".  This has been fixed.  [perl
           #127537] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127537>

       •   Fixed an issue with "pack()" where "pack "H"" (and "pack "h"") could
           read past the source when given a non-utf8 source and a utf8 target.
           [perl #126325] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126325>

       •   Fixed some cases where perl would abort due to a segmentation fault,
           or a C-level assert.  [perl #126193]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126193> [perl #126257]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126257> [perl #126258]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126258> [perl #126405]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126405> [perl #126602]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126602> [perl #127773]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127773> [perl #127786]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127786>

       •   A memory leak when setting $ENV{foo} on Darwin has been fixed.  [perl
           #126240] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126240>

       •   Perl now correctly raises an error when trying to compile patterns
           with unterminated character classes while there are trailing
           backslashes.  [perl #126141]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126141>

       •   "NOTHING" regops and "EXACTFU_SS" regops in "make_trie()" are now
           handled properly.  [perl #126206]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126206>

       •   Perl now only tests "semctl()" if we have everything needed to use
           it.  In FreeBSD the "semctl()" entry point may exist, but it can be
           disabled by policy.  [perl #127533]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127533>

       •   A regression that allowed undeclared barewords as hash keys to work
           despite strictures has been fixed.  [perl #126981]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126981>

       •   As an optimization (introduced in Perl 5.20.0), "uc()", "lc()",
           "ucfirst()" and "lcfirst()" sometimes modify their argument in-place
           rather than returning a modified copy.  The criteria for this
           optimization has been made stricter to avoid these functions
           accidentally modifying in-place when they should not, which has been
           happening in some cases, e.g. in List::Util.

       •   Excessive memory usage in the compilation of some regular expressions
           involving non-ASCII characters has been reduced.  A more complete fix
           is forthcoming in Perl 5.24.0.

Acknowledgements
       Perl 5.22.2 represents approximately 5 months of development since Perl
       5.22.1 and contains approximately 3,000 lines of changes across 110 files
       from 24 authors.

       Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there
       were approximately 1,500 lines of changes to 52 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant
       community of users and developers.  The following people are known to
       have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.22.2:

       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
       generated from version control history.  In particular, it does not
       include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
       modules included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN
       community for helping Perl to flourish.

       database at https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
       http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
       included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
       sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of "perl
       -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
       porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
       send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed
       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
       committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure
       out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate
       or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported.
       Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl core, not
       for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
