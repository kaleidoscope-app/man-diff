CHGRP(1)                     General Commands Manual                    CHGRP(1)

NAME
     chgrp – change group

SYNOPSIS
     chgrp [-fhnv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] group file ...

DESCRIPTION
     The chgrp utility sets the group ID of the file named by each file operand
     to the group ID specified by the group operand.

     The following options are available:

     -f      The force option ignores errors, except for usage errors and
             doesn't query about strange modes (unless the user does not have
             proper permissions).

     -H      If the -R option is specified, symbolic links on the command line
             are followed.  (Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal
             are not followed).

     -h      If the file is a symbolic link, the group ID of the link itself is
             changed rather than the file that is pointed to.

     -L      If the -R option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.

     -P      If the -R option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.
             This is the default. Use -h to change the group ID of a symbolic
             link.

     -R      Change the group ID for the file hierarchies rooted in the files
             instead of just the files themselves.

     -n      Interpret the group ID as numeric, avoiding the name lookup.

     -v      Cause chgrp to be verbose, showing files as the group is modified.

     The -H, -L and -P options are ignored unless the -R option is specified.
     In addition, these options override each other and the command's actions
     are determined by the last one specified.

     The group operand can be either a group name from the group database, or a
     numeric group ID.  If a group name is also a numeric group ID, the operand
     is used as a group name.

     The user invoking chgrp must belong to the specified group and be the owner
     of the file, or be the super-user.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The chgrp utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

COMPATIBILITY
     In previous versions of this system, symbolic links did not have groups.

     The -v option is non-standard and its use in scripts is not recommended.

FILES
     /etc/group  group ID file

STANDARDS
     The chgrp utility is expected to be IEEE Std 1003.2 (“POSIX.2”) compatible.
