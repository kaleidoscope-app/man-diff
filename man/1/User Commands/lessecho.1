LESSECHO(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LESSECHO(1)



NAME
       lessecho - expand metacharacters

SYNOPSIS
       lessecho [-ox] [-cx] [-pn] [-dn] [-mx] [-nn] [-ex] [-a] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       lessecho is a program that simply echos its arguments on standard output.
       But any metacharacter in the output is preceded by an "escape" character,
       which by default is a backslash.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -ex    Specifies "x", rather than backslash, to be the escape char for
              metachars.  If x is "-", no escape char is used and arguments
              containing metachars are surrounded by quotes instead.

       -ox    Specifies "x", rather than double-quote, to be the open quote
              character, which is used if the -e- option is specified.

       -cx    Specifies "x" to be the close quote character.

       -pn    Specifies "n" to be the open quote character, as an integer.

       -dn    Specifies "n" to be the close quote character, as an integer.

       -mx    Specifies "x" to be a metachar.  By default, no characters are
              considered metachars.

       -nn    Specifies "n" to be a metachar, as an integer.

       -fn    Specifies "n" to be the escape char for metachars, as an integer.

       -a     Specifies that all arguments are to be quoted.  The default is
              that only arguments containing metacharacters are quoted.
