uucp(1)                      General Commands Manual                     uucp(1)



NAME
       uucp - Unix to Unix copy

SYNOPSIS
       uucp [ options ] source-file destination-file

       uucp [ options ] source-file... destination-directory

DESCRIPTION
       The uucp command copies files between systems.  Each file argument is
       either a pathname on the local machine or is of the form

              system!path

       which is interpreted as being on a remote system.  In the first form, the
       contents of the first file are copied to the second.  In the second form,
       each source file is copied into the destination directory.

       A file be transferred to or from system2 via system1 by using

              system1!system2!path.

       Any pathname that does not begin with / or ~ will be appended to the
       current directory (unless the -W or --noexpand option is used); this
       resulting path will not necessarily exist on a remote system.  A pathname
       beginning with a simple ~ starts at the UUCP public directory; a pathname
       beginning with ~name starts at the home directory of the named user.  The
       ~ is interpreted on the appropriate system.  Note that some shells will
       interpret a simple ~ to the local home directory before uucp sees it; to
       avoid this the ~ must be quoted.

       Shell metacharacters ? * [ ] are interpreted on the appropriate system,
       assuming they are quoted to prevent the shell from interpreting them
       first.

       The copy does not take place immediately, but is queued up for the uucico
       (8) daemon; the daemon is started immediately unless the -r or --nouucico
       switch is given.  In any case, the next time the remote system is called
       the file(s) will be copied.

OPTIONS
       The following options may be given to uucp.

       -c, --nocopy
            Do not copy local source files to the spool directory.  If they are
            removed before being processed by the uucico (8) daemon, the copy
            will fail.  The files must be readable by the uucico (8) daemon, and
            by the invoking user.

       -C, --copy
            Copy local source files to the spool directory.  This is the
            default.

       -d, --directories
            Create all necessary directories when doing the copy.  This is the
            default.

       -f, --nodirectories
            If any necessary directories do not exist for the destination path,
            abort the copy.

       -R, --recursive
            If any of the source file names are directories, copy their contents
            recursively to the destination (which must itself be a directory).

       -g grade, --grade grade
            Set the grade of the file transfer command.  Jobs of a higher grade
            are executed first.  Grades run 0 ... 9 A ... Z a ... z from high to
            low.

       -m, --mail
            Report completion or failure of the file transfer by mail (1).

       -n user, --notify user
            Report completion or failure of the file transfer by mail (1) to the
            named user on the remote system.

       -r, --nouucico
            Do not start uucico (8) daemon immediately; merely queue up the file
            transfer for later execution.

       -j, --jobid
            Print jobid on standard output.  The job may be later cancelled by
            passing the jobid to the -k switch of uustat (1).  It is possible
            for some complex operations to produce more than one jobid, in which
            case each will be printed on a separate line.  For example
                 uucp sys1!~user1/file1 sys2!~user2/file2 ~user3
            will generate two separate jobs, one for the system sys1 and one for
            the system sys2.

       -W, --noexpand
            Do not prepend remote relative path names with the current
            directory.

       -t, --uuto
            This option is used by the uuto shell script.  It causes uucp to
            interpret the final argument as system!user.  The file(s) are sent
            to ~/receive/USER/LOCAL on the remote system, where USER is from the
            final argument and LOCAL is the local UUCP system name.  Also, uucp
            will act as though --notify user were specified.

       -x type, --debug type
            Turn on particular debugging types.  The following types are
            recognized: abnormal, chat, handshake, uucp-proto, proto, port,
            config, spooldir, execute, incoming, outgoing.  Only abnormal,
            config, spooldir and execute are meaningful for uucp.

            Multiple types may be given, separated by commas, and the --debug
            option may appear multiple times.  A number may also be given, which
            will turn on that many types from the foregoing list; for example,
            --debug 2 is equivalent to --debug abnormal,chat.

       -I file, --config file
            Set configuration file to use.  This option may not be available,
            depending upon how uucp was compiled.

       -v, --version
            Report version information and exit.

       --help
            Print a help message and exit.

SEE ALSO
       mail(1), uux(1), uustat(1), uucico(8)

BUGS
       Some of the options are dependent on the capabilities of the uucico (8)
       daemon on the remote system.

       The -n and -m switches do not work when transferring a file from one
       remote system to another.

       File modes are not preserved, except for the execute bit.  The resulting
       file is owned by the uucp user.
