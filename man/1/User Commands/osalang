OSALANG(1)                   General Commands Manual                  OSALANG(1)

NAME
     osalang – information about installed OSA languages

SYNOPSIS
     osalang [-dlL]

DESCRIPTION
     osalang prints information about installed OSA languages.  With no options,
     it prints an unadorned list of language names to standard output.  These
     names can be passed to the -l options of osacompile(1) and osascript(1).
     The options are as follows:

     -d    Only print the default language.

     -l    List in long format.  For each language, osalang will print its
           component subtype, manufacturer, and capability flags.  There are
           eight groups of optional routines that scripting components can
           support.  Each flag is either a letter, meaning the group is
           supported, or ‘-’, meaning it is not.  The letters map to the
           following groups:

                 c     compiling scripts.
                 g     getting source data.
                 x     coercing script values.
                 e     manipulating the event create and send functions.
                 r     recording scripts.
                 v     “convenience” APIs to execute scripts in one step.
                 d     manipulating dialects.
                 h     using scripts to handle Apple Events.

     -L    Same as -l, but also prints the description of each component after
           its name.
