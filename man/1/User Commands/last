LAST(1)                      General Commands Manual                     LAST(1)

NAME
     last – indicate last logins of users and ttys

SYNOPSIS
     last [--libxo] [-swy] [-d [[CC]YY][MMDD]hhmm[.SS]] [-f file] [-h host]
          [-n maxrec] [-t tty] [user ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The last utility will either list the sessions of specified users, ttys,
     and hosts, in reverse time order, or list the users logged in at a
     specified date and time.  Each line of output contains the user name, the
     tty from which the session was conducted, any hostname, the start and stop
     times for the session, and the duration of the session.  If the session is
     still continuing or was cut short by a crash or shutdown, last will so
     indicate.

     The following options are available:

     --libxo     Generate output via libxo(3) in a selection of different human
                 and machine readable formats.  See xo_parse_args(3) for details
                 on command line arguments.

     -d date     Specify the snapshot date and time.  All users logged in at the
                 snapshot date and time will be reported.  This may be used with
                 the -f option to derive the results from stored utx.log files.
                 When this argument is provided, all other options except for -f
                 and -n are ignored.  The argument should be in the form
                 [[CC]YY][MMDD]hhmm[.SS] where each pair of letters represents
                 the following:

                       CC      The first two digits of the year (the century).
                       YY      The second two digits of the year.  If YY is
                               specified, but CC is not, a value for YY between
                               69 and 99 results in a CC value of 19.
                               Otherwise, a CC value of 20 is used.
                       MM      Month of the year, from 1 to 12.
                       DD      Day of the month, from 1 to 31.
                       hh      Hour of the day, from 0 to 23.
                       mm      Minute of the hour, from 0 to 59.
                       SS      Second of the minute, from 0 to 60.

                 If the CC and YY letter pairs are not specified, the values
                 default to the current year.  If the SS letter pair is not
                 specified, the value defaults to 0.

     -f file     Read the file file instead of the default, /var/log/utx.log.

     -h host     Host names may be names or internet numbers.

     -n maxrec   Limit the report to maxrec lines.

     -s          Report the duration of the login session in seconds, instead of
                 the default days, hours and minutes.

     -t tty      Specify the tty.  Tty names may be given fully or abbreviated,
                 for example, “last -t 03” is equivalent to “last -t tty03”.

     -w          Widen the duration field to show seconds, as well as the
                 default days, hours and minutes.

     -y          Report the year in the session start time.

     If multiple arguments are given, and a snapshot time is not specified, the
     information which applies to any of the arguments is printed, e.g., “last
     root -t console” would list all of “root's” sessions as well as all
     sessions on the console terminal.  If no users, hostnames or terminals are
     specified, last prints a record of all logins and logouts.

     The pseudo-user reboot logs in at reboots of the system, thus “last reboot”
     will give an indication of mean time between reboot.

     If last is interrupted, it indicates to what date the search has
     progressed.  If interrupted with a quit signal last indicates how far the
     search has progressed and then continues.

FILES
     /var/log/utx.log  login data base

EXAMPLES
     Show logins in pts/14 with the duration in seconds and limit the report to
     two lines:

           $ last -n2 -s -t pts/14
           bob    pts/1   Wed Dec  9 11:08   still logged in
           bob    pts/2   Mon Dec  7 20:10 - 20:23  (     776)

     Show active logins at ‘December 7th 20:23’ of the current year:

           $ last -d 12072023
           bob    pts/1    Mon Dec  7 20:10 - 20:23  (00:12)
           bob    pts/6    Mon Dec  7 19:24 - 22:27  (03:03)
           alice  ttyv0    Mon Dec  7 19:18 - 22:27  (03:09)

HISTORY
     last utility first appeared in 1BSD.

AUTHORS
     The original version was written by Howard P. Katseff; Keith Bostic rewrote
     it in 1986/87 to add functionality and to improve code quality.  Philip
     Paeps added libxo(3) support in August 2018.

BUGS
     If a login shell should terminate abnormally for some reason, it is likely
     that a logout record will not be written to the utx.log file.  In this
     case, last will indicate the logout time as "shutdown".
