LAST(1)                      General Commands Manual                     LAST(1)

NAME
     last – indicate last logins of users and ttys

SYNOPSIS
     last [-n] [-h host] [-t tty] [user ...]

DESCRIPTION
     Last will list the sessions of specified users, ttys, and hosts, in reverse
     time order.  Each line of output contains the user name, the tty from which
     the session was conducted, any hostname, the start and stop times for the
     session, and the duration of the session.  If the session is still
     continuing or was cut short by a crash or shutdown, last will so indicate.

     -n          Limits the report to n lines.

     -h host     Host names may be names or internet numbers.

     -t tty      Specify the tty.  Tty names may be given fully or abbreviated,
                 for example, “last -t 03” is equivalent to “last -t tty03”.

     If multiple arguments are given, the information which applies to any of
     the arguments is printed, e.g., “last root -t console” would list all of
     “root's” sessions as well as all sessions on the console terminal. If no
     users, hostnames or terminals are specified, last prints a record of all
     logins and logouts.

     The pseudo-user reboot logs in at reboots of the system, thus “last reboot”
     will give an indication of mean time between reboot.

     If last is interrupted, it indicates to what date the search has
     progressed.  If interrupted with a quit signal last indicates how far the
     search has progressed and then continues.
