db_recover(1)                General Commands Manual               db_recover(1)

NAME
     db_recover

SYNOPSIS
     db_recover [-ceVv] [-h home] [-P password] [-t [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]]

DESCRIPTION
     The db_recover utility must be run after an unexpected application,
     Berkeley DB, or system failure to restore the database to a consistent
     state. All committed transactions are guaranteed to appear after db_recover
     has run, and all uncommitted transactions will be completely undone.

     The options are as follows:

     -c
       Perform catastrophic recovery instead of normal recovery.

     -e
       Retain the environment after running recovery. This option will rarely be
       used unless a DB_CONFIG file is present in the home directory. If a
       DB_CONFIG file is not present, then the regions will be created with
       default parameter values.

     -h
       Specify a home directory for the database environment; by default, the
       current working directory is used.

     -P
       Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite
       password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a window of
       vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see command-line
       arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory
       containing the command-line arguments.

     -t
       Recover to the time specified rather than to the most current possible
       date. The timestamp argument should be in the form [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]
       where each pair of letters represents the following:

       CC
         The first two digits of the year (the century).

       YY
         The second two digits of the year. If "YY" is specified, but "CC" is
         not, a value for "YY" between 69 and 99 results in a "YY" value of 19.
         Otherwise, a "YY" value of 20 is used.

       MM
         The month of the year, from 1 to 12.

       DD
         The day of the month, from 1 to 31.

       hh
         The hour of the day, from 0 to 23.

       mm
         The minute of the hour, from 0 to 59.

       SS
         The second of the minute, from 0 to 61.
       If the "CC" and "YY" letter pairs are not specified, the values default
       to the current year. If the "SS" letter pair is not specified, the value
       defaults to 0.

     -V
       Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

     -v
       Run in verbose mode.

     In the case of catastrophic recovery, an archival copy -- or snapshot -- of
     all database files must be restored along with all of the log files written
     since the database file snapshot was made. (If disk space is a problem, log
     files may be referenced by symbolic links). For further information on
     creating a database snapshot, see Archival Procedures. For further
     information on performing recovery, see Recovery Procedures.

     If the failure was not catastrophic, the files present on the system at the
     time of failure are sufficient to perform recovery.

     If log files are missing, db_recover will identify the missing log file(s)
     and fail, in which case the missing log files need to be restored and
     recovery performed again.

     The db_recover utility uses a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the
     -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the utility was run
     in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment). In order to avoid
     environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment, db_recover
     should always be given the chance to detach from the environment and exit
     gracefully. To cause db_recover to release all environment resources and
     exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).

     The db_recover utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

ENVIRONMENT
     DB_HOME  If the -h option is not specified and the environment variable
              DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as
              described in DB_ENV->open.
