sampleproc(1m)                    USER COMMANDS                   sampleproc(1m)



NAME
       sampleproc - sample processes on the CPUs. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       sampleproc [hertz]

DESCRIPTION
       This program samples which process is on each CPU, at a particular
       configurable rate. This can be used as an estimate for which process is
       consuming the most CPU time.

       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       Sample at 100 hertz,
              # sampleproc

       Sample at 400 hertz,
              # sampleproc 400

FIELDS
       PID    process ID

       COMMAND
              command name

       COUNT  number of samples

       PERCENT
              percent of CPU usage

BASED ON
       /usr/demo/dtrace/prof.d
