SNMPGETNEXT(1)                      Net-SNMP                      SNMPGETNEXT(1)



NAME
       snmpgetnext - communicates with a network entity using SNMP GETNEXT
       requests

SYNOPSIS
       snmpgetnext [COMMON OPTIONS] [-Cf] AGENT OID [OID]...

DESCRIPTION
       snmpget is an SNMP application that uses the SNMP GETNEXT request to
       query for information on a network entity.  One or more object
       identifiers (OIDs) may be given as arguments on the command line.  Each
       variable name is given in the format specified in variables(5).  For each
       one, the variable that is lexicographically "next" in the remote entity's
       MIB will be returned.

       For example:

       snmpgetnext -c public zeus interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifType.1

       will retrieve the variable interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifType.2:

       interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifType.2 = softwareLoopback(24)

       If the network entity has an error processing the request packet, an
       error message will be shown, helping to pinpoint in what way the request
       was malformed.

OPTIONS
       -Cf     If -Cf is not specified, some applications (snmpdelta, snmpget,
               snmpgetnext and snmpstatus) will try to fix errors returned by
               the agent that you were talking to and resend the request.  The
               only time this is really useful is if you specified a OID that
               didn't exist in your request and you're using SNMPv1 which
               requires "all or nothing" kinds of requests.

       In addition to this option, snmpgetnext takes the common options
       described in the snmpcmd(1) manual page.  Note that snmpgetnext REQUIRES
       an argument specifying the agent to query and at least one OID argument,
       as described there.
