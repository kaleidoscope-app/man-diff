GNOME-XML(1)                          1.1.0                         GNOME-XML(1)



NAME
       xml2-config - script to get information about the installed version of
       GNOME-XML

SYNOPSIS
       xml2-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--libs] [--cflags] [--version] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       xml2-config is a tool that is used to determine the compile and linker
       flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use GNOME-
       XML.

OPTIONS
       xml2-config accepts the following options:

       --version
               Print the currently installed version of GNOME-XML on the
               standard output.

       --libs  Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a GNOME-XML
               program.  Add --dynamic after --libs to print only shared library
               linking information.

       --cflags
               Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a GNOME-
               XML program.

       --prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that
               GNOME-XML was built with when computing the output for the
               --cflags and --libs options. This option must be specified before
               any --libs or --cflags options.
