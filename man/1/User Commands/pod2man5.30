DESCRIPTION
       pod2man is a front-end for Pod::Man, using it to generate *roff input
       from POD source.  The resulting *roff code is suitable for display on a
       terminal using nroff(1), normally via man(1), or printing using troff(1).

       input is the file to read for POD source (the POD can be embedded in
       code).  If input isn't given, it defaults to "STDIN".  output, if given,
       is the file to which to write the formatted output.  If output isn't
       given, the formatted output is written to "STDOUT".  Several POD files
       can be processed in the same pod2man invocation (saving module load and
       compile times) by providing multiple pairs of input and output files on
       the command line.

       --section, --release, --center, --date, and --official can be used to set
       the headers and footers to use; if not given, Pod::Man will assume
       various defaults.  See below or Pod::Man for details.

       pod2man assumes that your *roff formatters have a fixed-width font named
       "CW".  If yours is called something else (like "CR"), use --fixed to
       specify it.  This generally only matters for troff output for printing.
       Similarly, you can set the fonts used for bold, italic, and bold italic
       fixed-width output.

       Besides the obvious pod conversions, Pod::Man, and therefore pod2man also
       takes care of formatting func(), func(n), and simple variable references
       like $foo or @bar so you don't have to use code escapes for them; complex
       expressions like $fred{'stuff'} will still need to be escaped, though.
       It also translates dashes that aren't used as hyphens into en dashes,
       makes long dashes--like this--into proper em dashes, fixes "paired
       quotes," and takes care of several other troff-specific tweaks.  See
       Pod::Man for complete information.

OPTIONS
       -c string, --center=string
           Sets the centered page header for the ".TH" macro to string.  The
           default is "User Contributed Perl Documentation", but also see
           --official below.

       -d string, --date=string
           Set the left-hand footer string for the ".TH" macro to string.  By
           default, the modification date of the input file will be used, or the
           current date if input comes from "STDIN", and will be based on UTC
           (so that the output will be reproducible regardless of local time
           zone).

       --errors=style
           Set the error handling style.  "die" says to throw an exception on
           any POD formatting error.  "stderr" says to report errors on standard
           error, but not to throw an exception.  "pod" says to include a POD
           ERRORS section in the resulting documentation summarizing the errors.
           "none" ignores POD errors entirely, as much as possible.

           The default is "die".

       --fixed=font
           The fixed-width font to use for verbatim text and code.  Defaults to
           "CW".  Some systems may want "CR" instead.  Only matters for troff(1)
           output.

       --fixedbold=font
           Bold version of the fixed-width font.  Defaults to "CB".  Only
           matters for troff(1) output.

       --fixeditalic=font
           Italic version of the fixed-width font (actually, something of a
           misnomer, since most fixed-width fonts only have an oblique version,
           not an italic version).  Defaults to "CI".  Only matters for troff(1)
           output.

       --fixedbolditalic=font
           Bold italic (probably actually oblique) version of the fixed-width
           font.  Pod::Man doesn't assume you have this, and defaults to "CB".
           Some systems (such as Solaris) have this font available as "CX".
           Only matters for troff(1) output.

       -h, --help
           Print out usage information.

       -l, --lax
           No longer used.  pod2man used to check its input for validity as a
           manual page, but this should now be done by podchecker(1) instead.
           Accepted for backward compatibility; this option no longer does
           anything.

       --lquote=quote
       --rquote=quote
           Sets the quote marks used to surround C<> text.  --lquote sets the
           left quote mark and --rquote sets the right quote mark.  Either may
           also be set to the special value "none", in which case no quote mark
           is added on that side of C<> text (but the font is still changed for
           troff output).

           Also see the --quotes option, which can be used to set both quotes at
           once.  If both --quotes and one of the other options is set, --lquote
           or --rquote overrides --quotes.

       -n name, --name=name
           Set the name of the manual page for the ".TH" macro to name.  Without
           this option, the manual name is set to the uppercased base name of
           the file being converted unless the manual section is 3, in which
           case the path is parsed to see if it is a Perl module path.  If it
           is, a path like ".../lib/Pod/Man.pm" is converted into a name like
           "Pod::Man".  This option, if given, overrides any automatic
           determination of the name.

           Although one does not have to follow this convention, be aware that
           the convention for UNIX man pages for commands is for the man page
           title to be in all-uppercase, even if the command isn't.

           This option is probably not useful when converting multiple POD files
           at once.

           When converting POD source from standard input, the name will be set
           to "STDIN" if this option is not provided.  Providing this option is
           strongly recommended to set a meaningful manual page name.

       --nourls
           Normally, L<> formatting codes with a URL but anchor text are
           formatted to show both the anchor text and the URL.  In other words:

               L<foo|http://example.com/>

           is formatted as:

               foo <http://example.com/>

           This flag, if given, suppresses the URL when anchor text is given, so
           this example would be formatted as just "foo".  This can produce less
           cluttered output in cases where the URLs are not particularly
           important.

       -o, --official
           Set the default header to indicate that this page is part of the
           standard Perl release, if --center is not also given.

       -q quotes, --quotes=quotes
           Sets the quote marks used to surround C<> text to quotes.  If quotes
           is a single character, it is used as both the left and right quote.
           Otherwise, it is split in half, and the first half of the string is
           used as the left quote and the second is used as the right quote.

           quotes may also be set to the special value "none", in which case no
           quote marks are added around C<> text (but the font is still changed
           for troff output).

           Also see the --lquote and --rquote options, which can be used to set
           the left and right quotes independently.  If both --quotes and one of
           the other options is set, --lquote or --rquote overrides --quotes.

       -r version, --release=version
           Set the centered footer for the ".TH" macro to version.  By default,
           this is set to the version of Perl you run pod2man under.  Setting
           this to the empty string will cause some *roff implementations to use
           the system default value.

           Note that some system "an" macro sets assume that the centered footer
           will be a modification date and will prepend something like "Last
           modified: ".  If this is the case for your target system, you may
           want to set --release to the last modified date and --date to the
           version number.

       -s string, --section=string
           Set the section for the ".TH" macro.  The standard section numbering
           convention is to use 1 for user commands, 2 for system calls, 3 for
           functions, 4 for devices, 5 for file formats, 6 for games, 7 for
           miscellaneous information, and 8 for administrator commands.  There
           is a lot of variation here, however; some systems (like Solaris) use
           4 for file formats, 5 for miscellaneous information, and 7 for
           devices.  Still others use 1m instead of 8, or some mix of both.
           About the only section numbers that are reliably consistent are 1, 2,
           and 3.

           By default, section 1 will be used unless the file ends in ".pm", in
           which case section 3 will be selected.

       --stderr
           By default, pod2man dies if any errors are detected in the POD input.
           If --stderr is given and no --errors flag is present, errors are sent
           to standard error, but pod2man does not abort.  This is equivalent to
           "--errors=stderr" and is supported for backward compatibility.

       -u, --utf8
           By default, pod2man produces the most conservative possible *roff
           output to try to ensure that it will work with as many different
           *roff implementations as possible.  Many *roff implementations cannot
           handle non-ASCII characters, so this means all non-ASCII characters
           are converted either to a *roff escape sequence that tries to create
           a properly accented character (at least for troff output) or to "X".

           This option says to instead output literal UTF-8 characters.  If your
           *roff implementation can handle it, this is the best output format to
           use and avoids corruption of documents containing non-ASCII
           characters.  However, be warned that *roff source with literal UTF-8
           characters is not supported by many implementations and may even
           result in segfaults and other bad behavior.

           Be aware that, when using this option, the input encoding of your POD
           source should be properly declared unless it's US-ASCII.  Pod::Simple
           will attempt to guess the encoding and may be successful if it's
           Latin-1 or UTF-8, but it will warn, which by default results in a
           pod2man failure.  Use the "=encoding" command to declare the
           encoding.  See perlpod(1) for more information.

       -v, --verbose
           Print out the name of each output file as it is being generated.

EXIT STATUS
       As long as all documents processed result in some output, even if that
       output includes errata (a "POD ERRORS" section generated with
       "--errors=pod"), pod2man will exit with status 0.  If any of the
       documents being processed do not result in an output document, pod2man
       will exit with status 1.  If there are syntax errors in a POD document
       being processed and the error handling style is set to the default of
       "die", pod2man will abort immediately with exit status 255.

DIAGNOSTICS
       If pod2man fails with errors, see Pod::Man and Pod::Simple for
       information about what those errors might mean.

EXAMPLES
           pod2man program > program.1
           pod2man SomeModule.pm /usr/perl/man/man3/SomeModule.3
           pod2man --section=7 note.pod > note.7

       If you would like to print out a lot of man page continuously, you
       probably want to set the C and D registers to set contiguous page
       numbering and even/odd paging, at least on some versions of man(7).

           troff -man -rC1 -rD1 perl.1 perldata.1 perlsyn.1 ...

       To get index entries on "STDERR", turn on the F register, as in:

           troff -man -rF1 perl.1

       The indexing merely outputs messages via ".tm" for each major page,
       section, subsection, item, and any "X<>" directives.  See Pod::Man for
       more details.

BUGS
       Lots of this documentation is duplicated from Pod::Man.
