SNMPSET(1)                          Net-SNMP                          SNMPSET(1)



NAME
       snmpset - communicates with a network entity using SNMP SET requests

SYNOPSIS
       snmpset [COMMON OPTIONS] AGENT OID TYPE VALUE [OID TYPE VALUE]...

DESCRIPTION
       snmpset is an SNMP application that uses the SNMP SET request to set
       information on a network entity.  One or more object identifiers (OIDs)
       must be given as arguments on the command line.  A type and a value to be
       set must accompany each object identifier.  Each variable name is given
       in the format specified in variables(5).

       The TYPE is a single character, one of:
              i  INTEGER
              u  UNSIGNED
              s  STRING
              x  HEX STRING
              d  DECIMAL STRING
              n  NULLOBJ
              o  OBJID
              t  TIMETICKS
              a  IPADDRESS
              b  BITS
       Most of these will use the obvious corresponding ASN.1 type.  's', 'x',
       'd' and 'b' are all different ways of specifying an OCTET STRING value,
       and the 'u' unsigned type is also used for handling Gauge32 values.

       If you have the proper MIB file loaded, you can, in most cases, replace
       the type with an '=' sign. For an object of type OCTET STRING this will
       assume a string like the 's' type notation. For other types it will do
       "The Right Thing".

       For example:

       snmpset -c private -v 1 test-hub system.sysContact.0 s
       dpz@noc.rutgers.edu ip.ipforwarding.0 = 2

       will set the variables sysContact.0 and ipForwarding.0:

       system.sysContact.0 = STRING: "dpz@noc.rutgers.edu"
       ip.ipForwarding.0 = INTEGER: not-forwarding(2)

       If the network entity has an error processing the request packet, an
       error packet will be returned and a message will be shown, helping to
       pinpoint in what way the request was malformed.

OPTIONS
       snmpset takes the common options described in the snmpcmd(1) manual page.
       Note that snmpset REQUIRES  an argument specifying the agent to query and
       at least one set of OID/type/value arguments, as described in there.
