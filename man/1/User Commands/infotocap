SYNOPSIS
       infotocap [-vn width]  [-V] [-1] [-w width] file . . .

DESCRIPTION
       infotocap looks in file for terminfo descriptions.  For each one found,
       an equivalent termcap description is written to standard output.
       Terminfo use capabilities are translated directly to termcap tc
       capabilities.

       -v   print out tracing information on standard error as the program runs.

       -V   print out the version of the program in use on standard error and
            exit.

       -1   cause the fields to print out one to a line.  Otherwise, the fields
            will be printed several to a line to a maximum width of 60
            characters.

       -w   change the output to width characters.
