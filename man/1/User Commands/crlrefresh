CRLREFRESH(1)                General Commands Manual               CRLREFRESH(1)



NAME
       crlrefresh - update and maintain system-wide CRL cache

SYNOPSIS
       crlrefresh command [command-args] [options] crlrefresh r [options]
       crlrefresh f URL [options] crlrefresh F URI [options]

CRLREFRESH COMMAND SUMMARY
       r Refresh the entire CRL cache f Fetch a CRL from specified URL F Fetch a
       Certificate from specified URL

DESCRIPTION
       Crlrefresh is a UNIX command-line program which is used to refresh and
       update the contents of the system-wide cache of Certificate Revocation
       Lists (CRLs). CRLs, which are optionally used as part of the procedure
       for verifying X.509 certificates, are typically fetched from the network
       using a URL which appears in (some) certificates. Caching CRLs is an
       optimization to avoid costs of network latency and/or unavailability.
       Each CRL has a finite validity time which is specified in the CRL itself.
       This validity time may be as short as one day, or it may be much longer.
       Crlrefresh examines the contents of the CRL cache and updates - via
       network fetch - all CRLs which are currently, or will soon be, invalid.
       Crlrefresh is also use to fetch specific CRLs and certificates from the
       network; CRLs fetched via crlrefresh will be added to the CRL cache as
       well as provided to the specified output file (or to stdout if no output
       file is provided). The URL specified in the f and F commands must have
       schema "http:" or "ldap:".  Typically, crlrefresh would be run on a
       regular basis via one of the configuration files used by the cron(8)
       program.

CRLREFRESH OPTION SUMMARY
       s=stale_period
              Specify the time in days which, having elapsed after a CRL is
              expired, that the CRL is deleted fromt he CRL cache. The default
              is 10 days.

       o=expire_overlap
              Specify the time in seconds prior to a CRL's expiration when a
              refresh action will attempt to replace the CRL with a fresh copy.

       p      Purge all entries from the CRL cache, ensuring refresh with fresh
              CRLs. Normally, CRLs whose expiration date is more than
              expire_overlap past the current time are not refreshed.

       f      Perform full cryptographic verification of all CRLs in the CRL
              cache. Normally this step is only performed when a CRL is actually
              used to validate a certificate.

       k=keychain_name
              The full path to the CRL cache (which is always a keychain). The
              default is /var/db/crls/crlcache.db.

       v      Provide verbose output during operation.

       F=output_file_name
              When fetching a CRL or certificate, specifies the destination to
              which the fetched entity will be written. If this is not specified
              then the fetched entity is sent to stdout.

       n      When fetching a CRL, this inhibits the addition of the? fetched
              CRL to the system CRL cache.

       v      Execute in verbose mode.
