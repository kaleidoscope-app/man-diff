TIDY(1)                      General Commands Manual                     TIDY(1)



NAME
       tidy - validate, correct, and pretty-print HTML files

SYNOPSIS
       tidy [option ...] [file ...] [option ...] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Tidy reads HTML, XHTML and XML files and writes cleaned up markup.  For
       HTML varians, it detects and corrects many common coding errors and
       strives to produce visually equivalent markup that is both W3C complaint
       and works on most browsers.  A common use of Tidy is to convert plain
       HTML to XHTML.  For generic XML files, Tidy is limited to correcting
       basic well-formedness errors and pretty printing.

       If no markup file is specified, Tidy reads the standard input.  If no
       output file is specified, Tidy writes markup to the standard output.  If
       no error file is specified, Tidy writes messages to the standard error.

ENVIRONMENT
       HTML_TIDY      Name of the default configuration file.  This should be an
                      absolute path, since you will probably invoke tidy from
                      different directories.  The value of HTML_TIDY will be
                      parsed after the compiled-in default (defined with
                      -DCONFIG_FILE), but before any of the files specified
                      using -config.

EXIT STATUS
       0      All input files were processed successfully.

       1      There were warnings.

       2      There were errors.
