DESCRIPTION
       snmpvacm is an SNMP application that can be used to do simple maintenance
       on the View-based Control Module (VACM) tables of an SNMP agent.  The
       SNMPv3 VACM specifications (see RFC2575) define assorted tables to
       specify groups of users, MIB views, and authorised access settings.
       These snmpvacm commands effectively create or delete rows in the
       appropriate one of these tables, and match the equivalent configure
       directives which are documented in the snmpd.conf(5) man page.

       A fuller explanation of how these operate can be found in the project
       FAQ.

SUB-COMMANDS
   createSec2Group MODEL SECURITYNAME GROUPNAME
       Create an entry in the SNMPv3 security name to group table.  This table
       allows a single access control entry to be applied to a number of users
       (or 'principals'), and is indexed by the security model and security name
       values.

       MODEL

              An integer representing the security model, taking one of the
              following values:
              1 - reserved for SNMPv1
              2 - reserved for SNMPv2c
              3 - User-based Security Model (USM)


       SECURITYNAME

              A string representing the security name for a principal
              (represented in a security-model-independent format).  For USM-
              based requests, the security name is the same as the username.


       GROUPNAME

              A string identifying the group that this entry (i.e. security
              name/model pair) should belong to.  This group name will then be
              referenced in the access table (see createAccess below).

   deleteSec2Group MODEL SECURITYNAME
       Delete an entry from the SNMPv3 security name to group table, thus
       removing access control settings for the given principal.  The entry to
       be removed is indexed by the MODEL and SECURITYNAME values, which should
       match those used in the corresponding createSec2Group command (or
       equivalent).


   createView [-Ce] NAME SUBTREE MASK
       Create an entry in the SNMPv3 MIB view table.  A MIB view consists of a
       family of view subtrees which may be individually included in or
       (occasionally) excluded from the view.  Each view subtree is defined by a
       combination of an OID subtree together with a bit string mask.  The view
       table is indexed by the view name and subtree OID values.

       [-Ce]

              An optional flag to indicate that this view subtree should be
              excluded from the named view.  If not specified, the default is to
              include the subtree in the view.  When constructing a view from a
              mixture of included and excluded subtrees, the excluded subtrees
              should be defined first - particularly if the named view is
              already referenced in one or more access entries.

       NAME

              A string identifying a particular MIB view, of which this OID
              subtree/mask forms part (possibly the only part).

       SUBTREE

              The OID defining the root of the subtree to add to (or exclude
              from) the named view.

       MASK

              A bit mask indicating which sub-identifiers of the associated
              subtree OID should be regarded as significant.


   deleteView NAME SUBTREE
       Delete an entry from the SNMPv3 view table, thus removing the subtree
       from the given MIB view.  Removing the final (or only) subtree will
       result in the deletion of the view.  The entry to be removed is indexed
       by the NAME and SUBTREE values, which should match those used in the
       corresponding createView command (or equivalent).

       When removing subtrees from a mixed view (i.e. containing both included
       and excluded subtrees), the included subtrees should be removed first.


   createAccess GROUPNAME [CONTEXTPREFIX] MODEL LEVEL CONTEXTMATCH READVIEW
       WRITEVIEW NOTIFYVIEW
       Create an entry in the SNMPv3 access table, thus allowing a certain level
       of access to particular MIB views for the principals in the specified
       group (given suitable security model and levels in the request).  The
       access table is indexed by the group name, context prefix, security model
       and security level values.

       GROUPNAME

              The name of the group that this access entry applies to (as set up
              by a createSec2Group command, or equivalent)

       CONTEXTPREFIX

              A string representing a context name (or collection of context
              names) which this access entry applies to.  The interpretation of
              this string depends on the value of the CONTEXTMATCH field (see
              below).

              If omitted, this will default to the null context "".

       MODEL

              An integer representing the security model, taking one of the
              following values:
              1 - reserved for SNMPv1
              2 - reserved for SNMPv2c
              3 - User-based Security Model (USM)

       LEVEL

              An integer representing the minimal security level, taking one of
              the following values:
              1 - noAuthNoPriv
              2 - authNoPriv
              3 - authPriv

              This access entry will be applied to requests of this level or
              higher (where authPriv is higher than authNoPriv which is in turn
              higher than noAuthNoPriv).

       CONTEXTMATCH

              Indicates how to interpret the CONTEXTPREFIX value.  If this field
              has the value '1' (representing 'exact') then the context name of
              a request must match the CONTEXTPREFIX value exactly for this
              access entry to be applicable to that request.

              If this field has the value '2' (representing 'prefix') then the
              initial substring of the context name of a request must match the
              CONTEXTPREFIX value for this access entry to be applicable to that
              request.  This provides a simple form of wildcarding.

       READVIEW

              The name of the MIB view (as set up by createView or equivalent)
              defining the MIB objects for which this request may request the
              current values.

              If there is no view with this name, then read access is not
              granted.

       WRITEVIEW

              The name of the MIB view (as set up by createView or equivalent)
              defining the MIB objects for which this request may potentially
              SET new values.

              If there is no view with this name, then read access is not
              granted.

       NOTIFYVIEW

              The name of the MIB view (as set up by createView or equivalent)
              defining the MIB objects which may be included in notification
              request.

              Note that this aspect of access control is not currently
              supported.


   deleteAccess GROUPNAME [CONTEXTPREFIX] MODEL LEVEL
       Delete an entry from the SNMPv3 access table, thus removing the specified
       access control settings.  The entry to be removed is indexed by the group
       name, context prefix, security model and security level values, which
       should match those used in the corresponding createAccess command (or
       equivalent).


   createAuth GROUPNAME [CONTEXTPREFIX] MODEL LEVEL AUTHTYPE CONTEXTMATCH VIEW
       Create an entry in the Net-SNMP extension to the standard access table,
       thus allowing a certain type of access to the MIB view for the principals
       in the specified group.  The interpretation of GROUPNAME, CONTEXTPREFIX,
       MODEL, LEVEL and CONTEXTMATCH are the same as for the createAccess
       directive.  The extension access table is indexed by the group name,
       context prefix, security model, security level and authtype values.

       AUTHTYPE

              The style of access that this entry should be applied to.  See
              snmpd.conf(5) and snmptrapd.conf(5) for details of valid tokens.

       VIEW

              The name of the MIB view (as set up by createView or equivalent)
              defining the MIB objects for which this style of access is
              authorized.


   deleteAuth GROUPNAME [CONTEXTPREFIX] MODEL LEVEL AUTHTYPE
       Delete an entry from the extension access table, thus removing the
       specified access control settings.  The entry to be removed is indexed by
       the group name, context prefix, security model, security level and
       authtype values, which should match those used in the corresponding
       createAuth command (or equivalent).


       Note that snmpget REQUIRES  an argument specifying the agent to query as
       described in the .I snmpcmd(1) manual page.


EXAMPLES
       Given a pre-existing user dave (which could be set up using the
       snmpusm(1) command), we could configure full read-write access to the
       whole OID tree using the commands:


              snmpvacm localhost createSec2Group 3 dave RWGroup

              snmpvacm localhost createView   all .1 80

              snmpvacm localhost createAccess  RWGroup 3 1 1 all all none

       This creates a new security group named "RWGroup" containing the SNMPv3
       user "dave", a new view "all" containing the full OID tree based on
       .iso(1) , and then allows those users in the group "RWGroup" (i.e.
       "dave") both read- and write-access to the view "all" (i.e. the full OID
       tree) when using authenticated SNMPv3 requests.


       As a second example, we could set up read-only access to a portion of the
       OID tree using the commands:


              snmpvacm localhost createSec2Group 3 wes ROGroup

              snmpvacm localhost createView   sysView  system fe

              snmpvacm localhost createAccess  ROGroup 3 0 1 sysView none none

       This creates a new security group named "ROGroup" containing the (pre-
       existing) user "wes", a new view "sysView" containing just the OID tree
       based on .iso(1).org(3).dod(6).inet(1).mgmt(2).mib-2(1).system(1) , and
       then allows those users in the group "ROGroup" (i.e. "wes") read-access,
       but not write-access to the view "sysView" (i.e. the system group).


EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values are returned:

       0 - Successful completion

       1 - A usage syntax error (which displays a suitable usage message) or a
       request timeout.

       2 - An error occurred while executing the command (which also displays a
       suitable error message).


LIMITATIONS
       This utility does not support the configuration of new community strings,
       so is only of use for setting up new access control for SNMPv3 requests.
       It can be used to amend the access settings for existing community
       strings, but not to set up new ones.


       The use of numeric parameters for secLevel and contextMatch parameters is
       less than intuitive.  These commands do not provide the full flexibility
       of the equivalent config file directives.


       There is (currently) no equivalent to the one-shot configure directives
       rouser and rwuser.
