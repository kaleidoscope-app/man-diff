NAME
       encguess - guess character encodings of files

VERSION
       $Id: encguess,v 0.3 2020/12/02 01:28:17 dankogai Exp dankogai $

SYNOPSIS
         encguess [switches] filename...

   SWITCHES
       -h
         show this message and exit.

       -s
         specify a list of "suspect encoding types" to test, separated by either
         ":" or ","

       -S
         output a list of all acceptable encoding types that can be used with
         the -s param

       -u
         suppress display of unidentified types

   EXAMPLES:
       • Guess encoding of a file named "test.txt", using only the default
         suspect types.

            encguess test.txt

       • Guess the encoding type of a file named "test.txt", using the suspect
         types "euc-jp,shiftjis,7bit-jis".

            encguess -s euc-jp,shiftjis,7bit-jis test.txt
            encguess -s euc-jp:shiftjis:7bit-jis test.txt

       • Guess the encoding type of several files, do not display results for
         unidentified files.

            encguess -us euc-jp,shiftjis,7bit-jis test*.txt

DESCRIPTION
       The encoding identification is done by checking one encoding type at a
       time until all but the right type are eliminated. The set of encoding
       types to try is defined by the -s parameter and defaults to ascii, utf8
       and UTF-16/32 with BOM. This can be overridden by passing one or more
       encoding types via the -s parameter. If you need to pass in multiple
       suspect encoding types, use a quoted string with the a space separating
       each value.
