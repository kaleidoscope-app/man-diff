PERLVOS(1)              Perl Programmers Reference Guide              PERLVOS(1)




NAME
       perlvos - Perl for Stratus OpenVOS

SYNOPSIS
       This file contains notes for building perl on the Stratus OpenVOS
       operating system.  Perl is a scripting or macro language that is popular
       on many systems.  See perlbook for a number of good books on Perl.

       These are instructions for building Perl from source.  This version of
       Perl requires the dynamic linking support that is found in OpenVOS
       Release 17.1 and thus is not supported on OpenVOS Release 17.0 or earlier
       releases.

       If you are running VOS Release 14.4.1 or later, you can obtain a pre-
       compiled, supported copy of perl by purchasing the GNU Tools product from
       Stratus Technologies.

BUILDING PERL FOR OPENVOS
       To build perl from its source code on the Stratus V Series platform you
       must have OpenVOS Release 17.1.0 or later, GNU Tools Release 3.5 or
       later, and the C/POSIX Runtime Libraries.

       Follow the normal instructions for building perl; e.g, enter bash, run
       the Configure script, then use "gmake" to build perl.

INSTALLING PERL IN OPENVOS
       1.  After you have built perl using the Configure script, ensure that you
           have modify and default write permission to ">system>ported" and all
           subdirectories.  Then type

                gmake install

       2.  While there are currently no architecture-specific extensions or
           modules distributed with perl, the following directories can be used
           to hold such files (replace the string VERSION by the appropriate
           version number):

                >system>ported>lib>perl5>VERSION>i786

       3.  Site-specific perl extensions and modules can be installed in one of
           two places.  Put architecture-independent files into:

                >system>ported>lib>perl5>site_perl>VERSION

           Put site-specific architecture-dependent files into one of the
           following directories:

                >system>ported>lib>perl5>site_perl>VERSION>i786

       4.  You can examine the @INC variable from within a perl program to see
           the order in which Perl searches these directories.

USING PERL IN OPENVOS
   Restrictions of Perl on OpenVOS
       This port of Perl version 5 prefers Unix-style, slash-separated pathnames
       over OpenVOS-style greater-than-separated pathnames.  OpenVOS-style
       pathnames should work in most contexts, but if you have trouble, replace
       all greater-than characters by slash characters.  Because the slash
       character is used as a pathname delimiter, Perl cannot process OpenVOS
       pathnames containing a slash character in a directory or file name; these
       must be renamed.

       This port of Perl also uses Unix-epoch date values internally.  As long
       as you are dealing with ASCII character string representations of dates,
       this should not be an issue.  The supported epoch is January 1, 1980 to
       January 17, 2038.

       See the file pod/perlport.pod for more information about the OpenVOS port
       of Perl.

TEST STATUS
       A number of the perl self-tests fails for various reasons; generally
       these are minor and due to subtle differences between common POSIX-based
       environments and the OpenVOS POSIX environment.  Ensure that you conduct
       sufficient testing of your code to guarantee that it works properly in
       the OpenVOS environment.

SUPPORT STATUS
       I'm offering this port "as is".  You can ask me questions, but I can't
       guarantee I'll be able to answer them.  There are some excellent books
       available on the Perl language; consult a book seller.

       If you want a supported version of perl for OpenVOS, purchase the OpenVOS
       GNU Tools product from Stratus Technologies, along with a support
       contract (or from anyone else who will sell you support).
