NAME
     ipcrm â€“ remove the specified message queues, semaphore sets, and shared
     segments

SYNOPSIS
     ipcrm [-q msqid] [-m shmid] [-s semid] [-Q msgkey] [-M shmkey] [-S semkey]
           ...

DESCRIPTION
     The ipcrm utility removes the specified message queues, semaphores and
     shared memory segments.  These System V IPC objects can be specified by
     their creation ID or any associated key.

     The following options are used to specify which IPC objects will be
     removed.  Any number and combination of these options can be used:

     -q msqid
             Remove the message queue associated with the ID msqid from the
             system.

     -m shmid
             Mark the shared memory segment associated with ID shmid for
             removal.  This marked segment will be destroyed after the last
             detach.

     -s semid
             Remove the semaphore set associated with ID semid from the system.

     -Q msgkey
             Remove the message queue associated with key msgkey from the
             system.

     -M shmkey
             Mark the shared memory segment associated with key shmkey for
             removal.  This marked segment will be destroyed after the last
             detach.

     -S semkey
             Remove the semaphore set associated with key semkey from the
             system.

     The identifiers and keys associated with these System V IPC objects can be
     determined by using ipcs(1).
