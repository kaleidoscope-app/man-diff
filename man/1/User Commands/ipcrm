           ...

DESCRIPTION
     Ipcrm removes the specified message queues, semaphores and shared memory
     segments.  These System V IPC objects can be specified by their creation id
     or any associated key.

     The following options are used to specify which IPC objects will be
     removed.  Any number and combination of these options can be used:

     -M shmkey
             Mark the shared memory segment associated with key shmkey for
             removal.  This marked segment will be destroyed after the last
             detach.

     -m shmid
             Mark the shared memory segment associated with id shmid for
             removal.  This marked segment will be destroyed after the last
             detach.

     -Q msgkey
             Remove the message queue associated with key msgkey from the
             system.

     -q msqid
             Remove the message queue associated with the id msqid from the
             system.

     -S semkey
             Remove the semaphore set associated with key semkey from the
             system.

     -s semid
             Removes the semaphore set associated with id semid from the system.

     The identifiers and keys associated with these System V IPC objects can be
     determined by using ipcs(1)
