NROFF(1)                     General Commands Manual                    NROFF(1)



NAME
       nroff - emulate nroff command with groff

SYNOPSIS
nroff [ -CchipStUv ] [ -dcs ] [ -Mdir ] [ -mname ] [ -nnum ] [ -olist ] [ -rcn ]
             [ -Tname ] [ file ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       The nroff script emulates the nroff command using groff.  Only ascii,
       latin1, utf8, and cp1047 are valid arguments for the -T option, selecting
       the output encoding emitted by grotty, groff's TTY output device.  If an
       invalid or no -T option is given, nroff checks the current locale to
       select a default output device.  It first tries the locale program, then
       the environment variables LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, and LANG, and finally the
       LESSCHARSET environment variable.

       The -h and -c options are equivalent to grotty's options -h (using tabs
       in the output) and -c (using the old output scheme instead of SGR escape
       sequences).  The -d, -C, -i, -M, -m, -n, -o, and -r options have the
       effect described in troff(1).  In addition, nroff silently ignores the
       options -e, -q, and -s (which are not implemented in troff).  Options -p
       (pic), -t (tbl), -S (safer), and -U (unsafe) are passed to groff.  -v
       shows the version number.

ENVIRONMENT
       GROFF_BIN_PATH
              A colon separated list of directories in which to search for the
              groff executable before searching in PATH.  If unset, `/usr/bin'
              is used.

NOTES
       This shell script is basically intended for use with man(1), so warnings
       are suppressed.  nroff-style character definitions (in the file tty-
       char.tmac) are also loaded to emulate unrepresentable glyphs.
