TAIL(1)                      General Commands Manual                     TAIL(1)

NAME
     tail – display the last part of a file

SYNOPSIS
     tail [-F | -f | -r] [-q] [-b number | -c number | -n number] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The tail utility displays the contents of file or, by default, its standard
     input, to the standard output.

     The display begins at a byte, line or 512-byte block location in the input.
     Numbers having a leading plus (‘+’) sign are relative to the beginning of
     the input, for example, “-c +2” starts the display at the second byte of
     the input.  Numbers having a leading minus (‘-’) sign or no explicit sign
     are relative to the end of the input, for example, “-n 2” displays the last
     two lines of the input.  The default starting location is “-n 10”, or the
     last 10 lines of the input.

     The options are as follows:

     -b number
             The location is number 512-byte blocks.

     -c number
             The location is number bytes.

     -f      The -f option causes tail to not stop when end of file is reached,
             but rather to wait for additional data to be appended to the input.
             The -f option is ignored if the standard input is a pipe, but not
             if it is a FIFO.

     -F      The -F option implies the -f option, but tail will also check to
             see if the file being followed has been renamed or rotated.  The
             file is closed and reopened when tail detects that the filename
             being read from has a new inode number.  The -F option is ignored
             if reading from standard input rather than a file.

     -n number
             The location is number lines.

     -q      Suppresses printing of headers when multiple files are being
             examined.

     -r      The -r option causes the input to be displayed in reverse order, by
             line.  Additionally, this option changes the meaning of the -b, -c
             and -n options.  When the -r option is specified, these options
             specify the number of bytes, lines or 512-byte blocks to display,
             instead of the bytes, lines or blocks from the beginning or end of
             the input from which to begin the display.  The default for the -r
             option is to display all of the input.

     If more than a single file is specified, each file is preceded by a header
     consisting of the string “==> XXX <==” where XXX is the name of the file
     unless -q flag is specified.

EXIT STATUS
     The tail utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

STANDARDS
     The tail utility is expected to be a superset of the IEEE Std 1003.2-1992
     (“POSIX.2”) specification.  In particular, the -F, -b and -r options are
     extensions to that standard.

     The historic command line syntax of tail is supported by this
     implementation.  The only difference between this implementation and
     historic versions of tail, once the command line syntax translation has
     been done, is that the -b, -c and -n options modify the -r option, i.e.,
     “-r -c 4” displays the last 4 characters of the last line of the input,
     while the historic tail (using the historic syntax “-4cr”) would ignore the
     -c option and display the last 4 lines of the input.

HISTORY
     A tail command appeared in PWB UNIX.
