NAME
       ip2cc - lookup country from IP address or hostname

SYNOPSIS
       ip2cc [host-to-find]

DESCRIPTION
       Ip2cc is a program to lookup countries of IP addresses. Ip2cc has two
       modes: interactive and non-interactive.  Interactive mode allows the user
       to query more than one hostname.  Non-interactive mode is used to print
       just the country for a single host.

ARGUMENTS
       Interactive mode is entered when no arguments are given.

       Non-interactive mode is used when the name or Internet address of the
       host to be looked up is given as the first argument.

SEE ALSO
       IP::Country - the fast database used by this script.
