INSTALL-INFO(1)                   User Commands                  INSTALL-INFO(1)



NAME
       install-info - update info/dir entries

SYNOPSIS
       install-info [OPTION]... [INFO-FILE [DIR-FILE]]

DESCRIPTION
       Install or delete dir entries from INFO-FILE in the Info directory file
       DIR-FILE.

OPTIONS
       --delete
              delete existing entries for INFO-FILE from DIR-FILE; don't insert
              any new entries.

       --dir-file=NAME
              specify file name of Info directory file.  This is equivalent to
              using the DIR-FILE argument.

       --entry=TEXT
              insert TEXT as an Info directory entry.  TEXT should have the form
              of an Info menu item line plus zero or more extra lines starting
              with whitespace.  If you specify more than one entry, they are all
              added.  If you don't specify any entries, they are determined from
              information in the Info file itself.

       --help display this help and exit.

       --info-file=FILE
              specify Info file to install in the directory.  This is equivalent
              to using the INFO-FILE argument.

       --info-dir=DIR
              same as --dir-file=DIR/dir.

       --item=TEXT
              same as --entry TEXT.  An Info directory entry is actually a menu
              item.

       --quiet
              suppress warnings.

       --remove
              same as --delete.

       --section=SEC
              put this file's entries in section SEC of the directory.  If you
              specify more than one section, all the entries are added in each
              of the sections.  If you don't specify any sections, they are
              determined from information in the Info file itself.

       --version
              display version information and exit.
