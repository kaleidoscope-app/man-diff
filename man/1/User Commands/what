WHAT(1)                      General Commands Manual                     WHAT(1)

NAME
     what – show what versions of object modules were used to construct a file

SYNOPSIS
     what [-qs] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The what utility searches each specified file for sequences of the form
     “@(#)” as inserted by the SCCS source code control system.  It prints the
     remainder of the string following this marker, up to a NUL character,
     newline, double quote, ‘>’ character, or backslash.

     The following options are available:

     -q      Only output the match text, rather than formatting it.

     -s      Stop searching each file after the first match.

EXIT STATUS
     Exit status is 0 if any matches were found, otherwise 1.

SEE ALSO
     ident(1), strings(1)

STANDARDS
     The what utility conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”).  The -q
     option is a non-standard FreeBSD extension which may not be available on
     other operating systems.

HISTORY
     The what command appeared in 4.0BSD.

BUGS
     This is a rewrite of the SCCS command of the same name, and behavior may
     not be identical.
