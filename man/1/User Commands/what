WHAT(1)                      General Commands Manual                     WHAT(1)

NAME
     what – show what versions of object modules were used to construct a file

SYNOPSIS
     what name ...

DESCRIPTION
     what reads each file name and searches for sequences of the form “@(#)”, as
     inserted by the source code control system.  It prints the remainder of the
     string following this marker, up to a null character, newline, double
     quote, or “> character.”

BUGS
     As BSD is not licensed to distribute SCCS.  This is a rewrite of the what
     command which is part of SCCS; it may not behave in exactly the same manner
     as that command does.

HISTORY
     The what command appeared in 4.0BSD.
