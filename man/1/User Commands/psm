     need to delete an existing user from the system that is currently enrolled;
     thus allowing the next password change to enroll into Apple Silicon
     password slot manager.

     By default psm will execute the command supplied and report if anything
     went wrong.

     Here is a complete list of the options available:

     -d disk3s5
              specify a disk to operate on <disk3s5>

     -s #     specify a specifc slot number

     -v       will make psm more verbose.
