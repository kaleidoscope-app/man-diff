NAME
       ppdmerge - merge ppd files (deprecated)

SYNOPSIS
       ppdmerge [ -o output-ppd-file ] ppd-file ppd-file [ ...  ppd-file ]

DESCRIPTION
       ppdmerge merges two or more PPD files into a single, multi-language PPD
       file.  This program is deprecated and will be removed in a future release
       of CUPS.

OPTIONS
       ppdmerge supports the following options:

       -o output-ppd-file
              Specifies the PPD file to create.  If not specified, the merged
              PPD file is written to the standard output.  If the output file
              already exists, it is silently overwritten.

NOTES
       PPD files are deprecated and will no longer be supported in a future
       feature release of CUPS.  Printers that do not support IPP can be
       supported using applications such as ippeveprinter(1).

       ppdmerge does not check whether the merged PPD files are for the same
       device.  Merging of different device PPDs will yield unpredictable
       results.
