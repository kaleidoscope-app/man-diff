NAME
       pod2readme - script to convert POD to README file

SYNOPSIS
         pod2readme lib/Some/Module.pm

DESCRIPTIONS
       Converts POD in the specified file to a README text file. If a second
       argument is given, it will use that as the output file and assume that is
       the type of file to export:

         pod2readme Module.pm COPYING

       If need be, this can be overridden in cases where the output file is not
       the same as the type, using a third argument:

         pod2readme Module.pm Module-Install.HOWTO install
