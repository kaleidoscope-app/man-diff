NAME
       perlport - Writing portable Perl

DESCRIPTION
       Perl runs on numerous operating systems.  While most of them share much
       in common, they also have their own unique features.

       This document is meant to help you to find out what constitutes portable
       Perl code.  That way once you make a decision to write portably, you know
       where the lines are drawn, and you can stay within them.

       There is a tradeoff between taking full advantage of one particular type
       of computer and taking advantage of a full range of them.  Naturally, as
       you broaden your range and become more diverse, the common factors drop,
       and you are left with an increasingly smaller area of common ground in
       which you can operate to accomplish a particular task.  Thus, when you
       begin attacking a problem, it is important to consider under which part
       of the tradeoff curve you want to operate.  Specifically, you must decide
       whether it is important that the task that you are coding have the full
       generality of being portable, or whether to just get the job done right
       now.  This is the hardest choice to be made.  The rest is easy, because
       Perl provides many choices, whichever way you want to approach your
       problem.

       Looking at it another way, writing portable code is usually about
       willfully limiting your available choices.  Naturally, it takes
       discipline and sacrifice to do that.  The product of portability and
       convenience may be a constant.  You have been warned.

       Be aware of two important points:

       Not all Perl programs have to be portable
           There is no reason you should not use Perl as a language to glue Unix
           tools together, or to prototype a Macintosh application, or to manage
           the Windows registry.  If it makes no sense to aim for portability
           for one reason or another in a given program, then don't bother.

       Nearly all of Perl already is portable
           Don't be fooled into thinking that it is hard to create portable Perl
           code.  It isn't.  Perl tries its level-best to bridge the gaps
           between what's available on different platforms, and all the means
           available to use those features.  Thus almost all Perl code runs on
           any machine without modification.  But there are some significant
           issues in writing portable code, and this document is entirely about
           those issues.

       Here's the general rule: When you approach a task commonly done using a
       whole range of platforms, think about writing portable code.  That way,
       you don't sacrifice much by way of the implementation choices you can
       avail yourself of, and at the same time you can give your users lots of
       platform choices.  On the other hand, when you have to take advantage of
       some unique feature of a particular platform, as is often the case with
       systems programming (whether for Unix, Windows, VMS, etc.), consider
       writing platform-specific code.

       When the code will run on only two or three operating systems, you may
       need to consider only the differences of those particular systems.  The
       important thing is to decide where the code will run and to be deliberate
       in your decision.

       The material below is separated into three main sections: main issues of
       portability ("ISSUES"), platform-specific issues ("PLATFORMS"), and
       built-in perl functions that behave differently on various ports
       ("FUNCTION IMPLEMENTATIONS").

       This information should not be considered complete; it includes possibly
       transient information about idiosyncrasies of some of the ports, almost
       all of which are in a state of constant evolution.  Thus, this material
       should be considered a perpetual work in progress ("<IMG
       SRC="yellow_sign.gif" ALT="Under Construction">").

ISSUES
   Newlines
       In most operating systems, lines in files are terminated by newlines.
       Just what is used as a newline may vary from OS to OS.  Unix
       traditionally uses "\012", one type of DOSish I/O uses "\015\012", and
       Mac OS uses "\015".

       Perl uses "\n" to represent the "logical" newline, where what is logical
       may depend on the platform in use.  In MacPerl, "\n" always means "\015".
       In DOSish perls, "\n" usually means "\012", but when accessing a file in
       "text" mode, perl uses the ":crlf" layer that translates it to (or from)
       "\015\012", depending on whether you're reading or writing. Unix does the
       same thing on ttys in canonical mode.  "\015\012" is commonly referred to
       as CRLF.

       To trim trailing newlines from text lines use chomp().  With default
       settings that function looks for a trailing "\n" character and thus trims
       in a portable way.

       When dealing with binary files (or text files in binary mode) be sure to
       explicitly set $/ to the appropriate value for your file format before
       using chomp().

       Because of the "text" mode translation, DOSish perls have limitations in
       using "seek" and "tell" on a file accessed in "text" mode.  Stick to
       "seek"-ing to locations you got from "tell" (and no others), and you are
       usually free to use "seek" and "tell" even in "text" mode.  Using "seek"
       or "tell" or other file operations may be non-portable.  If you use
       "binmode" on a file, however, you can usually "seek" and "tell" with
       arbitrary values in safety.

       A common misconception in socket programming is that "\n" eq "\012"
       everywhere.  When using protocols such as common Internet protocols,
       "\012" and "\015" are called for specifically, and the values of the
       logical "\n" and "\r" (carriage return) are not reliable.

           print SOCKET "Hi there, client!\r\n";      # WRONG
           print SOCKET "Hi there, client!\015\012";  # RIGHT

       However, using "\015\012" (or "\cM\cJ", or "\x0D\x0A") can be tedious and
       unsightly, as well as confusing to those maintaining the code.  As such,
       the Socket module supplies the Right Thing for those who want it.

           use Socket qw(:DEFAULT :crlf);
           print SOCKET "Hi there, client!$CRLF"      # RIGHT

       When reading from a socket, remember that the default input record
       separator $/ is "\n", but robust socket code will recognize as either
       "\012" or "\015\012" as end of line:

           while (<SOCKET>) {
               # ...
           }

       Because both CRLF and LF end in LF, the input record separator can be set
       to LF and any CR stripped later.  Better to write:

           use Socket qw(:DEFAULT :crlf);
           local($/) = LF;      # not needed if $/ is already \012

           while (<SOCKET>) {
               s/$CR?$LF/\n/;   # not sure if socket uses LF or CRLF, OK
           #   s/\015?\012/\n/; # same thing
           }

       This example is preferred over the previous one--even for Unix
       platforms--because now any "\015"'s ("\cM"'s) are stripped out (and there
       was much rejoicing).

       Similarly, functions that return text data--such as a function that
       fetches a web page--should sometimes translate newlines before returning
       the data, if they've not yet been translated to the local newline
       representation.  A single line of code will often suffice:

           $data =~ s/\015?\012/\n/g;
           return $data;

       Some of this may be confusing.  Here's a handy reference to the ASCII CR
       and LF characters.  You can print it out and stick it in your wallet.

           LF  eq  \012  eq  \x0A  eq  \cJ  eq  chr(10)  eq  ASCII 10
           CR  eq  \015  eq  \x0D  eq  \cM  eq  chr(13)  eq  ASCII 13

                    | Unix | DOS  | Mac  |
               ---------------------------
               \n   |  LF  |  LF  |  CR  |
               \r   |  CR  |  CR  |  LF  |
               \n * |  LF  | CRLF |  CR  |
               \r * |  CR  |  CR  |  LF  |
               ---------------------------
               * text-mode STDIO

       The Unix column assumes that you are not accessing a serial line (like a
       tty) in canonical mode.  If you are, then CR on input becomes "\n", and
       "\n" on output becomes CRLF.

       These are just the most common definitions of "\n" and "\r" in Perl.
       There may well be others.  For example, on an EBCDIC implementation such
       as z/OS (OS/390) or OS/400 (using the ILE, the PASE is ASCII-based) the
       above material is similar to "Unix" but the code numbers change:

           LF  eq  \025  eq  \x15  eq  \cU  eq  chr(21)  eq  CP-1047 21
           LF  eq  \045  eq  \x25  eq           chr(37)  eq  CP-0037 37
           CR  eq  \015  eq  \x0D  eq  \cM  eq  chr(13)  eq  CP-1047 13
           CR  eq  \015  eq  \x0D  eq  \cM  eq  chr(13)  eq  CP-0037 13

                    | z/OS | OS/400 |
               ----------------------
               \n   |  LF  |  LF    |
               \r   |  CR  |  CR    |
               \n * |  LF  |  LF    |
               \r * |  CR  |  CR    |
               ----------------------
               * text-mode STDIO

   Numbers endianness and Width
       Different CPUs store integers and floating point numbers in different
       orders (called endianness) and widths (32-bit and 64-bit being the most
       common today).  This affects your programs when they attempt to transfer
       numbers in binary format from one CPU architecture to another, usually
       either "live" via network connection, or by storing the numbers to
       secondary storage such as a disk file or tape.

       Conflicting storage orders make utter mess out of the numbers.  If a
       little-endian host (Intel, VAX) stores 0x12345678 (305419896 in decimal),
       a big-endian host (Motorola, Sparc, PA) reads it as 0x78563412
       (2018915346 in decimal).  Alpha and MIPS can be either: Digital/Compaq
       used/uses them in little-endian mode; SGI/Cray uses them in big-endian
       mode.  To avoid this problem in network (socket) connections use the
       "pack" and "unpack" formats "n" and "N", the "network" orders.  These are
       guaranteed to be portable.

       As of perl 5.10.0, you can also use the ">" and "<" modifiers to force
       big- or little-endian byte-order.  This is useful if you want to store
       signed integers or 64-bit integers, for example.

       You can explore the endianness of your platform by unpacking a data
       structure packed in native format such as:

           print unpack("h*", pack("s2", 1, 2)), "\n";
           # '10002000' on e.g. Intel x86 or Alpha 21064 in little-endian mode
           # '00100020' on e.g. Motorola 68040

       If you need to distinguish between endian architectures you could use
       either of the variables set like so:

           $is_big_endian   = unpack("h*", pack("s", 1)) =~ /01/;
           $is_little_endian = unpack("h*", pack("s", 1)) =~ /^1/;

       Differing widths can cause truncation even between platforms of equal
       endianness.  The platform of shorter width loses the upper parts of the
       number.  There is no good solution for this problem except to avoid
       transferring or storing raw binary numbers.

       One can circumnavigate both these problems in two ways.  Either transfer
       and store numbers always in text format, instead of raw binary, or else
       consider using modules like Data::Dumper and Storable (included as of
       perl 5.8).  Keeping all data as text significantly simplifies matters.

       The v-strings are portable only up to v2147483647 (0x7FFFFFFF), that's
       how far EBCDIC, or more precisely UTF-EBCDIC will go.

   Files and Filesystems
       Most platforms these days structure files in a hierarchical fashion.  So,
       it is reasonably safe to assume that all platforms support the notion of
       a "path" to uniquely identify a file on the system.  How that path is
       really written, though, differs considerably.

       Although similar, file path specifications differ between Unix, Windows,
       Mac OS, OS/2, VMS, VOS, RISC OS, and probably others.  Unix, for example,
       is one of the few OSes that has the elegant idea of a single root
       directory.

       DOS, OS/2, VMS, VOS, and Windows can work similarly to Unix with "/" as
       path separator, or in their own idiosyncratic ways (such as having
       several root directories and various "unrooted" device files such NIL:
       and LPT:).

       Mac OS 9 and earlier used ":" as a path separator instead of "/".

       The filesystem may support neither hard links ("link") nor symbolic links
       ("symlink", "readlink", "lstat").

       The filesystem may support neither access timestamp nor change timestamp
       (meaning that about the only portable timestamp is the modification
       timestamp), or one second granularity of any timestamps (e.g. the FAT
       filesystem limits the time granularity to two seconds).

       The "inode change timestamp" (the "-C" filetest) may really be the
       "creation timestamp" (which it is not in Unix).

       VOS perl can emulate Unix filenames with "/" as path separator.  The
       native pathname characters greater-than, less-than, number-sign, and
       percent-sign are always accepted.

       RISC OS perl can emulate Unix filenames with "/" as path separator, or go
       native and use "." for path separator and ":" to signal filesystems and
       disk names.

       Don't assume Unix filesystem access semantics: that read, write, and
       execute are all the permissions there are, and even if they exist, that
       their semantics (for example what do r, w, and x mean on a directory) are
       the Unix ones.  The various Unix/POSIX compatibility layers usually try
       to make interfaces like chmod() work, but sometimes there simply is no
       good mapping.

       If all this is intimidating, have no (well, maybe only a little) fear.
       There are modules that can help.  The File::Spec modules provide methods
       to do the Right Thing on whatever platform happens to be running the
       program.

           use File::Spec::Functions;
           chdir(updir());        # go up one directory
           my $file = catfile(curdir(), 'temp', 'file.txt');
           # on Unix and Win32, './temp/file.txt'
           # on Mac OS Classic, ':temp:file.txt'
           # on VMS, '[.temp]file.txt'

       File::Spec is available in the standard distribution as of version
       5.004_05.  File::Spec::Functions is only in File::Spec 0.7 and later, and
       some versions of perl come with version 0.6.  If File::Spec is not
       updated to 0.7 or later, you must use the object-oriented interface from
       File::Spec (or upgrade File::Spec).

       In general, production code should not have file paths hardcoded.  Making
       them user-supplied or read from a configuration file is better, keeping
       in mind that file path syntax varies on different machines.

       This is especially noticeable in scripts like Makefiles and test suites,
       which often assume "/" as a path separator for subdirectories.

       Also of use is File::Basename from the standard distribution, which
       splits a pathname into pieces (base filename, full path to directory, and
       file suffix).

       Even when on a single platform (if you can call Unix a single platform),
       remember not to count on the existence or the contents of particular
       system-specific files or directories, like /etc/passwd,
       /etc/sendmail.conf, /etc/resolv.conf, or even /tmp/.  For example,
       /etc/passwd may exist but not contain the encrypted passwords, because
       the system is using some form of enhanced security.  Or it may not
       contain all the accounts, because the system is using NIS.  If code does
       need to rely on such a file, include a description of the file and its
       format in the code's documentation, then make it easy for the user to
       override the default location of the file.

       Don't assume a text file will end with a newline.  They should, but
       people forget.

       Do not have two files or directories of the same name with different
       case, like test.pl and Test.pl, as many platforms have case-insensitive
       (or at least case-forgiving) filenames.  Also, try not to have non-word
       characters (except for ".") in the names, and keep them to the 8.3
       convention, for maximum portability, onerous a burden though this may
       appear.

       Likewise, when using the AutoSplit module, try to keep your functions to
       8.3 naming and case-insensitive conventions; or, at the least, make it so
       the resulting files have a unique (case-insensitively) first 8
       characters.

       Whitespace in filenames is tolerated on most systems, but not all, and
       even on systems where it might be tolerated, some utilities might become
       confused by such whitespace.

       Many systems (DOS, VMS ODS-2) cannot have more than one "." in their
       filenames.

       Don't assume ">" won't be the first character of a filename.  Always use
       "<" explicitly to open a file for reading, or even better, use the three-
       arg version of open, unless you want the user to be able to specify a
       pipe open.

           open my $fh, '<', $existing_file) or die $!;

       If filenames might use strange characters, it is safest to open it with
       "sysopen" instead of "open".  "open" is magic and can translate
       characters like ">", "<", and "|", which may be the wrong thing to do.
       (Sometimes, though, it's the right thing.)  Three-arg open can also help
       protect against this translation in cases where it is undesirable.

       Don't use ":" as a part of a filename since many systems use that for
       their own semantics (Mac OS Classic for separating pathname components,
       many networking schemes and utilities for separating the nodename and the
       pathname, and so on).  For the same reasons, avoid "@", ";" and "|".

       Don't assume that in pathnames you can collapse two leading slashes "//"
       into one: some networking and clustering filesystems have special
       semantics for that.  Let the operating system to sort it out.

       The portable filename characters as defined by ANSI C are

        a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r t u v w x y z
        A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R T U V W X Y Z
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
        . _ -

       and the "-" shouldn't be the first character.  If you want to be
       hypercorrect, stay case-insensitive and within the 8.3 naming convention
       (all the files and directories have to be unique within one directory if
       their names are lowercased and truncated to eight characters before the
       ".", if any, and to three characters after the ".", if any).  (And do not
       use "."s in directory names.)

   System Interaction
       Not all platforms provide a command line.  These are usually platforms
       that rely primarily on a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user
       interaction.  A program requiring a command line interface might not work
       everywhere.  This is probably for the user of the program to deal with,
       so don't stay up late worrying about it.

       Some platforms can't delete or rename files held open by the system, this
       limitation may also apply to changing filesystem metainformation like
       file permissions or owners.  Remember to "close" files when you are done
       with them.  Don't "unlink" or "rename" an open file.  Don't "tie" or
       "open" a file already tied or opened; "untie" or "close" it first.

       Don't open the same file more than once at a time for writing, as some
       operating systems put mandatory locks on such files.

       Don't assume that write/modify permission on a directory gives the right
       to add or delete files/directories in that directory.  That is filesystem
       specific: in some filesystems you need write/modify permission also (or
       even just) in the file/directory itself.  In some filesystems (AFS, DFS)
       the permission to add/delete directory entries is a completely separate
       permission.

       Don't assume that a single "unlink" completely gets rid of the file: some
       filesystems (most notably the ones in VMS) have versioned filesystems,
       and unlink() removes only the most recent one (it doesn't remove all the
       versions because by default the native tools on those platforms remove
       just the most recent version, too).  The portable idiom to remove all the
       versions of a file is

           1 while unlink "file";

       This will terminate if the file is undeleteable for some reason
       (protected, not there, and so on).

       Don't count on a specific environment variable existing in %ENV.  Don't
       count on %ENV entries being case-sensitive, or even case-preserving.
       Don't try to clear %ENV by saying "%ENV = ();", or, if you really have
       to, make it conditional on "$^O ne 'VMS'" since in VMS the %ENV table is
       much more than a per-process key-value string table.

       On VMS, some entries in the %ENV hash are dynamically created when their
       key is used on a read if they did not previously exist.  The values for
       $ENV{HOME}, $ENV{TERM}, $ENV{HOME}, and $ENV{USER}, are known to be
       dynamically generated.  The specific names that are dynamically generated
       may vary with the version of the C library on VMS, and more may exist
       than is documented.

       On VMS by default, changes to the %ENV hash are persistent after the
       process exits.  This can cause unintended issues.

       Don't count on signals or %SIG for anything.

       Don't count on filename globbing.  Use "opendir", "readdir", and
       "closedir" instead.

       Don't count on per-program environment variables, or per-program current
       directories.

       Don't count on specific values of $!, neither numeric nor especially the
       strings values. Users may switch their locales causing error messages to
       be translated into their languages.  If you can trust a POSIXish
       environment, you can portably use the symbols defined by the Errno
       module, like ENOENT.  And don't trust on the values of $! at all except
       immediately after a failed system call.

   Command names versus file pathnames
       Don't assume that the name used to invoke a command or program with
       "system" or "exec" can also be used to test for the existence of the file
       that holds the executable code for that command or program.  First, many
       systems have "internal" commands that are built-in to the shell or OS and
       while these commands can be invoked, there is no corresponding file.
       Second, some operating systems (e.g., Cygwin, DJGPP, OS/2, and VOS) have
       required suffixes for executable files; these suffixes are generally
       permitted on the command name but are not required.  Thus, a command like
       "perl" might exist in a file named "perl", "perl.exe", or "perl.pm",
       depending on the operating system.  The variable "_exe" in the Config
       module holds the executable suffix, if any.  Third, the VMS port
       carefully sets up $^X and $Config{perlpath} so that no further processing
       is required.  This is just as well, because the matching regular
       expression used below would then have to deal with a possible trailing
       version number in the VMS file name.

       To convert $^X to a file pathname, taking account of the requirements of
       the various operating system possibilities, say:

        use Config;
        my $thisperl = $^X;
        if ($^O ne 'VMS')
           {$thisperl .= $Config{_exe} unless $thisperl =~ m/$Config{_exe}$/i;}

       To convert $Config{perlpath} to a file pathname, say:

        use Config;
        my $thisperl = $Config{perlpath};
        if ($^O ne 'VMS')
           {$thisperl .= $Config{_exe} unless $thisperl =~ m/$Config{_exe}$/i;}

   Networking
       Don't assume that you can reach the public Internet.

       Don't assume that there is only one way to get through firewalls to the
       public Internet.

       Don't assume that you can reach outside world through any other port than
       80, or some web proxy.  ftp is blocked by many firewalls.

       Don't assume that you can send email by connecting to the local SMTP
       port.

       Don't assume that you can reach yourself or any node by the name
       'localhost'.  The same goes for '127.0.0.1'.  You will have to try both.

       Don't assume that the host has only one network card, or that it can't
       bind to many virtual IP addresses.

       Don't assume a particular network device name.

       Don't assume a particular set of ioctl()s will work.

       Don't assume that you can ping hosts and get replies.

       Don't assume that any particular port (service) will respond.

       Don't assume that Sys::Hostname (or any other API or command) returns
       either a fully qualified hostname or a non-qualified hostname: it all
       depends on how the system had been configured.  Also remember that for
       things such as DHCP and NAT, the hostname you get back might not be very
       useful.

       All the above "don't":s may look daunting, and they are, but the key is
       to degrade gracefully if one cannot reach the particular network service
       one wants.  Croaking or hanging do not look very professional.

   Interprocess Communication (IPC)
       In general, don't directly access the system in code meant to be
       portable.  That means, no "system", "exec", "fork", "pipe", "``", "qx//",
       "open" with a "|", nor any of the other things that makes being a perl
       hacker worth being.

       Commands that launch external processes are generally supported on most
       platforms (though many of them do not support any type of forking).  The
       problem with using them arises from what you invoke them on.  External
       tools are often named differently on different platforms, may not be
       available in the same location, might accept different arguments, can
       behave differently, and often present their results in a platform-
       dependent way.  Thus, you should seldom depend on them to produce
       consistent results. (Then again, if you're calling netstat -a, you
       probably don't expect it to run on both Unix and CP/M.)

       One especially common bit of Perl code is opening a pipe to sendmail:

           open(MAIL, '|/usr/lib/sendmail -t')
               or die "cannot fork sendmail: $!";

       This is fine for systems programming when sendmail is known to be
       available.  But it is not fine for many non-Unix systems, and even some
       Unix systems that may not have sendmail installed.  If a portable
       solution is needed, see the various distributions on CPAN that deal with
       it.  Mail::Mailer and Mail::Send in the MailTools distribution are
       commonly used, and provide several mailing methods, including mail,
       sendmail, and direct SMTP (via Net::SMTP) if a mail transfer agent is not
       available.  Mail::Sendmail is a standalone module that provides simple,
       platform-independent mailing.

       The Unix System V IPC ("msg*(), sem*(), shm*()") is not available even on
       all Unix platforms.

       Do not use either the bare result of "pack("N", 10, 20, 30, 40)" or bare
       v-strings (such as "v10.20.30.40") to represent IPv4 addresses: both
       forms just pack the four bytes into network order.  That this would be
       equal to the C language "in_addr" struct (which is what the socket code
       internally uses) is not guaranteed.  To be portable use the routines of
       the Socket extension, such as "inet_aton()", "inet_ntoa()", and
       "sockaddr_in()".

       The rule of thumb for portable code is: Do it all in portable Perl, or
       use a module (that may internally implement it with platform-specific
       code, but expose a common interface).

   External Subroutines (XS)
       XS code can usually be made to work with any platform, but dependent
       libraries, header files, etc., might not be readily available or
       portable, or the XS code itself might be platform-specific, just as Perl
       code might be.  If the libraries and headers are portable, then it is
       normally reasonable to make sure the XS code is portable, too.

       A different type of portability issue arises when writing XS code:
       availability of a C compiler on the end-user's system.  C brings with it
       its own portability issues, and writing XS code will expose you to some
       of those.  Writing purely in Perl is an easier way to achieve
       portability.

   Standard Modules
       In general, the standard modules work across platforms.  Notable
       exceptions are the CPAN module (which currently makes connections to
       external programs that may not be available), platform-specific modules
       (like ExtUtils::MM_VMS), and DBM modules.

       There is no one DBM module available on all platforms.  SDBM_File and the
       others are generally available on all Unix and DOSish ports, but not in
       MacPerl, where only NBDM_File and DB_File are available.

       The good news is that at least some DBM module should be available, and
       AnyDBM_File will use whichever module it can find.  Of course, then the
       code needs to be fairly strict, dropping to the greatest common factor
       (e.g., not exceeding 1K for each record), so that it will work with any
       DBM module.  See AnyDBM_File for more details.

   Time and Date
       The system's notion of time of day and calendar date is controlled in
       widely different ways.  Don't assume the timezone is stored in $ENV{TZ},
       and even if it is, don't assume that you can control the timezone through
       that variable.  Don't assume anything about the three-letter timezone
       abbreviations (for example that MST would be the Mountain Standard Time,
       it's been known to stand for Moscow Standard Time).  If you need to use
       timezones, express them in some unambiguous format like the exact number
       of minutes offset from UTC, or the POSIX timezone format.

       Don't assume that the epoch starts at 00:00:00, January 1, 1970, because
       that is OS- and implementation-specific.  It is better to store a date in
       an unambiguous representation.  The ISO 8601 standard defines YYYY-MM-DD
       as the date format, or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS (that's a literal "T"
       separating the date from the time).  Please do use the ISO 8601 instead
       of making us guess what date 02/03/04 might be.  ISO 8601 even sorts
       nicely as-is.  A text representation (like "1987-12-18") can be easily
       converted into an OS-specific value using a module like Date::Parse.  An
       array of values, such as those returned by "localtime", can be converted
       to an OS-specific representation using Time::Local.

       When calculating specific times, such as for tests in time or date
       modules, it may be appropriate to calculate an offset for the epoch.

           require Time::Local;
           my $offset = Time::Local::timegm(0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 70);

       The value for $offset in Unix will be 0, but in Mac OS Classic will be
       some large number.  $offset can then be added to a Unix time value to get
       what should be the proper value on any system.

   Character sets and character encoding
       Assume very little about character sets.

       Assume nothing about numerical values ("ord", "chr") of characters.  Do
       not use explicit code point ranges (like \xHH-\xHH); use for example
       symbolic character classes like "[:print:]".

       Do not assume that the alphabetic characters are encoded contiguously (in
       the numeric sense).  There may be gaps.

       Do not assume anything about the ordering of the characters.  The
       lowercase letters may come before or after the uppercase letters; the
       lowercase and uppercase may be interlaced so that both "a" and "A" come
       before "b"; the accented and other international characters may be
       interlaced so that ae comes before "b".

   Internationalisation
       If you may assume POSIX (a rather large assumption), you may read more
       about the POSIX locale system from perllocale.  The locale system at
       least attempts to make things a little bit more portable, or at least
       more convenient and native-friendly for non-English users.  The system
       affects character sets and encoding, and date and time
       formatting--amongst other things.

       If you really want to be international, you should consider Unicode.  See
       perluniintro and perlunicode for more information.

       If you want to use non-ASCII bytes (outside the bytes 0x00..0x7f) in the
       "source code" of your code, to be portable you have to be explicit about
       what bytes they are.  Someone might for example be using your code under
       a UTF-8 locale, in which case random native bytes might be illegal
       ("Malformed UTF-8 ...")  This means that for example embedding ISO 8859-1
       bytes beyond 0x7f into your strings might cause trouble later.  If the
       bytes are native 8-bit bytes, you can use the "bytes" pragma.  If the
       bytes are in a string (regular expression being a curious string), you
       can often also use the "\xHH" notation instead of embedding the bytes as-
       is.  If you want to write your code in UTF-8, you can use the "utf8".

   System Resources
       If your code is destined for systems with severely constrained (or
       missing!) virtual memory systems then you want to be especially mindful
       of avoiding wasteful constructs such as:

           my @lines = <$very_large_file>;            # bad

           while (<$fh>) {$file .= $_}                # sometimes bad
           my $file = join('', <$fh>);                # better

       The last two constructs may appear unintuitive to most people.  The first
       repeatedly grows a string, whereas the second allocates a large chunk of
       memory in one go.  On some systems, the second is more efficient that the
       first.

   Security
       Most multi-user platforms provide basic levels of security, usually
       implemented at the filesystem level.  Some, however, unfortunately do
       not.  Thus the notion of user id, or "home" directory, or even the state
       of being logged-in, may be unrecognizable on many platforms.  If you
       write programs that are security-conscious, it is usually best to know
       what type of system you will be running under so that you can write code
       explicitly for that platform (or class of platforms).

       Don't assume the Unix filesystem access semantics: the operating system
       or the filesystem may be using some ACL systems, which are richer
       languages than the usual rwx.  Even if the rwx exist, their semantics
       might be different.

       (From security viewpoint testing for permissions before attempting to do
       something is silly anyway: if one tries this, there is potential for race
       conditions. Someone or something might change the permissions between the
       permissions check and the actual operation.  Just try the operation.)

       Don't assume the Unix user and group semantics: especially, don't expect
       the $< and $> (or the $( and $)) to work for switching identities (or
       memberships).

       Don't assume set-uid and set-gid semantics. (And even if you do, think
       twice: set-uid and set-gid are a known can of security worms.)

   Style
       For those times when it is necessary to have platform-specific code,
       consider keeping the platform-specific code in one place, making porting
       to other platforms easier.  Use the Config module and the special
       variable $^O to differentiate platforms, as described in "PLATFORMS".

       Be careful in the tests you supply with your module or programs.  Module
       code may be fully portable, but its tests might not be.  This often
       happens when tests spawn off other processes or call external programs to
       aid in the testing, or when (as noted above) the tests assume certain
       things about the filesystem and paths.  Be careful not to depend on a
       specific output style for errors, such as when checking $! after a failed
       system call.  Using $! for anything else than displaying it as output is
       doubtful (though see the Errno module for testing reasonably portably for
       error value). Some platforms expect a certain output format, and Perl on
       those platforms may have been adjusted accordingly.  Most specifically,
       don't anchor a regex when testing an error value.

CPAN Testers
       Modules uploaded to CPAN are tested by a variety of volunteers on
       different platforms.  These CPAN testers are notified by mail of each new
       upload, and reply to the list with PASS, FAIL, NA (not applicable to this
       platform), or UNKNOWN (unknown), along with any relevant notations.

       The purpose of the testing is twofold: one, to help developers fix any
       problems in their code that crop up because of lack of testing on other
       platforms; two, to provide users with information about whether a given
       module works on a given platform.

       Also see:

       •   Testing results: <http://www.cpantesters.org/>

PLATFORMS
       Perl is built with a $^O variable that indicates the operating system it
       was built on.  This was implemented to help speed up code that would
       otherwise have to "use Config" and use the value of $Config{osname}.  Of
       course, to get more detailed information about the system, looking into
       %Config is certainly recommended.

       %Config cannot always be trusted, however, because it was built at
       compile time.  If perl was built in one place, then transferred
       elsewhere, some values may be wrong.  The values may even have been
       edited after the fact.

   Unix
       Perl works on a bewildering variety of Unix and Unix-like platforms (see
       e.g. most of the files in the hints/ directory in the source code kit).
       On most of these systems, the value of $^O (hence $Config{'osname'}, too)
       is determined either by lowercasing and stripping punctuation from the
       first field of the string returned by typing "uname -a" (or a similar
       command) at the shell prompt or by testing the file system for the
       presence of uniquely named files such as a kernel or header file.  Here,
       for example, are a few of the more popular Unix flavors:

           uname         $^O        $Config{'archname'}

       Because the value of $Config{archname} may depend on the hardware
       architecture, it can vary more than the value of $^O.

   DOS and Derivatives
       Perl has long been ported to Intel-style microcomputers running under
       systems like PC-DOS, MS-DOS, OS/2, and most Windows platforms you can
       bring yourself to mention (except for Windows CE, if you count that).
       Users familiar with COMMAND.COM or CMD.EXE style shells should be aware
       that each of these file specifications may have subtle differences:

           my $filespec0 = "c:/foo/bar/file.txt";
           my $filespec1 = "c:\\foo\\bar\\file.txt";
           my $filespec2 = 'c:\foo\bar\file.txt';
           my $filespec3 = 'c:\\foo\\bar\\file.txt';

       System calls accept either "/" or "\" as the path separator.  However,
       many command-line utilities of DOS vintage treat "/" as the option
       prefix, so may get confused by filenames containing "/".  Aside from
       calling any external programs, "/" will work just fine, and probably
       better, as it is more consistent with popular usage, and avoids the
       problem of remembering what to backwhack and what not to.

       The DOS FAT filesystem can accommodate only "8.3" style filenames.  Under
       the "case-insensitive, but case-preserving" HPFS (OS/2) and NTFS (NT)
       filesystems you may have to be careful about case returned with functions
       like "readdir" or used with functions like "open" or "opendir".

       DOS also treats several filenames as special, such as AUX, PRN, NUL, CON,
       COM1, LPT1, LPT2, etc.  Unfortunately, sometimes these filenames won't
       even work if you include an explicit directory prefix.  It is best to
       avoid such filenames, if you want your code to be portable to DOS and its
       derivatives.  It's hard to know what these all are, unfortunately.

       Users of these operating systems may also wish to make use of scripts
       such as pl2bat.bat or pl2cmd to put wrappers around your scripts.

       Newline ("\n") is translated as "\015\012" by STDIO when reading from and
       writing to files (see "Newlines").  "binmode(FILEHANDLE)" will keep "\n"
       translated as "\012" for that filehandle.  Since it is a no-op on other
       systems, "binmode" should be used for cross-platform code that deals with
       binary data.  That's assuming you realize in advance that your data is in
       binary.  General-purpose programs should often assume nothing about their
       data.

       The $^O variable and the $Config{archname} values for various DOSish
       perls are as follows:

            OS            $^O      $Config{archname}   ID    Version

       The various MSWin32 Perl's can distinguish the OS they are running on via
       the value of the fifth element of the list returned from
       Win32::GetOSVersion().  For example:

           if ($^O eq 'MSWin32') {
               my @os_version_info = Win32::GetOSVersion();
               print +('3.1','95','NT')[$os_version_info[4]],"\n";
           }

       There are also Win32::IsWinNT() and Win32::IsWin95(), try "perldoc
       Win32", and as of libwin32 0.19 (not part of the core Perl distribution)
       Win32::GetOSName().  The very portable POSIX::uname() will work too:

           c:\> perl -MPOSIX -we "print join '|', uname"
           Windows NT|moonru|5.0|Build 2195 (Service Pack 2)|x86

   VMS
       Perl on VMS is discussed in perlvms in the perl distribution.

       The official name of VMS as of this writing is OpenVMS.

       Perl on VMS can accept either VMS- or Unix-style file specifications as
       in either of the following:

           $ perl -ne "print if /perl_setup/i" SYS$LOGIN:LOGIN.COM
           $ perl -ne "print if /perl_setup/i" /sys$login/login.com

       but not a mixture of both as in:

           $ perl -ne "print if /perl_setup/i" sys$login:/login.com
           Can't open sys$login:/login.com: file specification syntax error

       Interacting with Perl from the Digital Command Language (DCL) shell often
       requires a different set of quotation marks than Unix shells do.  For
       example:

           $ perl -e "print ""Hello, world.\n"""
           Hello, world.

       There are several ways to wrap your perl scripts in DCL .COM files, if
       you are so inclined.  For example:

           $ write sys$output "Hello from DCL!"
           $ if p1 .eqs. ""
           $ then perl -x 'f$environment("PROCEDURE")
           $ else perl -x - 'p1 'p2 'p3 'p4 'p5 'p6 'p7 'p8
           $ deck/dollars="__END__"
           #!/usr/bin/perl

           print "Hello from Perl!\n";

           __END__
           $ endif

       Do take care with "$ ASSIGN/nolog/user SYS$COMMAND: SYS$INPUT" if your
       perl-in-DCL script expects to do things like "$read = <STDIN>;".

       The VMS operating system has two filesystems, known as ODS-2 and ODS-5.

       For ODS-2, filenames are in the format "name.extension;version".  The
       maximum length for filenames is 39 characters, and the maximum length for
       extensions is also 39 characters.  Version is a number from 1 to 32767.
       Valid characters are "/[A-Z0-9$_-]/".

       The ODS-2 filesystem is case-insensitive and does not preserve case.
       Perl simulates this by converting all filenames to lowercase internally.

       For ODS-5, filenames may have almost any character in them and can
       include Unicode characters.  Characters that could be misinterpreted by
       the DCL shell or file parsing utilities need to be prefixed with the "^"
       character, or replaced with hexadecimal characters prefixed with the "^"
       character.  Such prefixing is only needed with the pathnames are in VMS
       format in applications.  Programs that can accept the Unix format of
       pathnames do not need the escape characters.  The maximum length for
       filenames is 255 characters.  The ODS-5 file system can handle both a
       case preserved and a case sensitive mode.

       ODS-5 is only available on the OpenVMS for 64 bit platforms.

       Support for the extended file specifications is being done as optional
       settings to preserve backward compatibility with Perl scripts that assume
       the previous VMS limitations.

       In general routines on VMS that get a Unix format file specification
       should return it in a Unix format, and when they get a VMS format
       specification they should return a VMS format unless they are documented
       to do a conversion.

       For routines that generate return a file specification, VMS allows
       setting if the C library which Perl is built on if it will be returned in
       VMS format or in Unix format.

       With the ODS-2 file system, there is not much difference in syntax of
       filenames without paths for VMS or Unix.  With the extended character set
       available with ODS-5 there can be a significant difference.

       Because of this, existing Perl scripts written for VMS were sometimes
       treating VMS and Unix filenames interchangeably.  Without the extended
       character set enabled, this behavior will mostly be maintained for
       backwards compatibility.

       When extended characters are enabled with ODS-5, the handling of Unix
       formatted file specifications is to that of a Unix system.

       VMS file specifications without extensions have a trailing dot.  An
       equivalent Unix file specification should not show the trailing dot.

       The result of all of this, is that for VMS, for portable scripts, you can
       not depend on Perl to present the filenames in lowercase, to be case
       sensitive, and that the filenames could be returned in either Unix or VMS
       format.

       And if a routine returns a file specification, unless it is intended to
       convert it, it should return it in the same format as it found it.

       "readdir" by default has traditionally returned lowercased filenames.
       When the ODS-5 support is enabled, it will return the exact case of the
       filename on the disk.

       Files without extensions have a trailing period on them, so doing a
       "readdir" in the default mode with a file named A.;5 will return a. when
       VMS is (though that file could be opened with "open(FH, 'A')").

       With support for extended file specifications and if "opendir" was given
       a Unix format directory, a file named A.;5 will return a and optionally
       in the exact case on the disk.  When "opendir" is given a VMS format
       directory, then "readdir" should return a., and again with the optionally
       the exact case.

       RMS had an eight level limit on directory depths from any rooted logical
       (allowing 16 levels overall) prior to VMS 7.2, and even with versions of
       VMS on VAX up through 7.3.  Hence "PERL_ROOT:[LIB.2.3.4.5.6.7.8]" is a
       valid directory specification but "PERL_ROOT:[LIB.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9]" is
       not.  Makefile.PL authors might have to take this into account, but at
       least they can refer to the former as "/PERL_ROOT/lib/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/".

       Pumpkings and module integrators can easily see whether files with too
       many directory levels have snuck into the core by running the following
       in the top-level source directory:

        $ perl -ne "$_=~s/\s+.*//; print if scalar(split /\//) > 8;" < MANIFEST

       The VMS::Filespec module, which gets installed as part of the build
       process on VMS, is a pure Perl module that can easily be installed on
       non-VMS platforms and can be helpful for conversions to and from RMS
       native formats.  It is also now the only way that you should check to see
       if VMS is in a case sensitive mode.

       What "\n" represents depends on the type of file opened.  It usually
       represents "\012" but it could also be "\015", "\012", "\015\012",
       "\000", "\040", or nothing depending on the file organization and record
       format.  The VMS::Stdio module provides access to the special fopen()
       requirements of files with unusual attributes on VMS.

       TCP/IP stacks are optional on VMS, so socket routines might not be
       implemented.  UDP sockets may not be supported.

       The TCP/IP library support for all current versions of VMS is dynamically
       loaded if present, so even if the routines are configured, they may
       return a status indicating that they are not implemented.

       The value of $^O on OpenVMS is "VMS".  To determine the architecture that
       you are running on without resorting to loading all of %Config you can
       examine the content of the @INC array like so:

           if (grep(/VMS_AXP/, @INC)) {
               print "I'm on Alpha!\n";

           } elsif (grep(/VMS_VAX/, @INC)) {
               print "I'm on VAX!\n";

           } elsif (grep(/VMS_IA64/, @INC)) {
               print "I'm on IA64!\n";

           } else {
               print "I'm not so sure about where $^O is...\n";
           }

       In general, the significant differences should only be if Perl is running
       on VMS_VAX or one of the 64 bit OpenVMS platforms.

       On VMS, perl determines the UTC offset from the
       "SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL" logical name.  Although the VMS epoch began
       at 17-NOV-1858 00:00:00.00, calls to "localtime" are adjusted to count
       offsets from 01-JAN-1970 00:00:00.00, just like Unix.

   VOS
       Perl on VOS (also known as OpenVOS) is discussed in README.vos in the
       perl distribution (installed as perlvos).  Perl on VOS can accept either
       VOS- or Unix-style file specifications as in either of the following:

           $ perl -ne "print if /perl_setup/i" >system>notices
           $ perl -ne "print if /perl_setup/i" /system/notices

       or even a mixture of both as in:

           $ perl -ne "print if /perl_setup/i" >system/notices

       Even though VOS allows the slash character to appear in object names,
       because the VOS port of Perl interprets it as a pathname delimiting
       character, VOS files, directories, or links whose names contain a slash
       character cannot be processed.  Such files must be renamed before they
       can be processed by Perl.

       Older releases of VOS (prior to OpenVOS Release 17.0) limit file names to
       32 or fewer characters, prohibit file names from starting with a "-"
       character, and prohibit file names from containing any character matching
       "tr/ !#%&'()*;<=>?//".

       Newer releases of VOS (OpenVOS Release 17.0 or later) support a feature
       known as extended names.  On these releases, file names can contain up to
       255 characters, are prohibited from starting with a "-" character, and
       the set of prohibited characters is reduced to any character matching
       "tr/#%*<>?//".  There are restrictions involving spaces and apostrophes:
       these characters must not begin or end a name, nor can they immediately
       precede or follow a period.  Additionally, a space must not immediately
       precede another space or hyphen.  Specifically, the following character
       combinations are prohibited:  space-space, space-hyphen, period-space,
       space-period, period-apostrophe, apostrophe-period, leading or trailing
       space, and leading or trailing apostrophe.  Although an extended file
       name is limited to 255 characters, a path name is still limited to 256
       characters.

       The value of $^O on VOS is "vos".  To determine the architecture that you
       are running on without resorting to loading all of %Config you can
       examine the content of the @INC array like so:

           if ($^O =~ /vos/) {
               print "I'm on a Stratus box!\n";
           } else {
               print "I'm not on a Stratus box!\n";
               die;
           }

   EBCDIC Platforms
       Recent versions of Perl have been ported to platforms such as OS/400 on
       AS/400 minicomputers as well as OS/390, VM/ESA, and BS2000 for S/390
       Mainframes.  Such computers use EBCDIC character sets internally (usually
       Character Code Set ID 0037 for OS/400 and either 1047 or POSIX-BC for
       S/390 systems).  On the mainframe perl currently works under the "Unix
       system services for OS/390" (formerly known as OpenEdition), VM/ESA
       OpenEdition, or the BS200 POSIX-BC system (BS2000 is supported in perl
       5.6 and greater).  See perlos390 for details.  Note that for OS/400 there
       is also a port of Perl 5.8.1/5.10.0 or later to the PASE which is ASCII-
       based (as opposed to ILE which is EBCDIC-based), see perlos400.

       As of R2.5 of USS for OS/390 and Version 2.3 of VM/ESA these Unix sub-
       systems do not support the "#!" shebang trick for script invocation.
       Hence, on OS/390 and VM/ESA perl scripts can be executed with a header
       similar to the following simple script:

           : # use perl
               eval 'exec /usr/local/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+"$@"}'
                   if 0;
           #!/usr/local/bin/perl     # just a comment really

           print "Hello from perl!\n";

       OS/390 will support the "#!" shebang trick in release 2.8 and beyond.
       Calls to "system" and backticks can use POSIX shell syntax on all S/390
       systems.

       On the AS/400, if PERL5 is in your library list, you may need to wrap
       your perl scripts in a CL procedure to invoke them like so:

           BEGIN
             CALL PGM(PERL5/PERL) PARM('/QOpenSys/hello.pl')
           ENDPGM

       This will invoke the perl script hello.pl in the root of the QOpenSys
       file system.  On the AS/400 calls to "system" or backticks must use CL
       syntax.

       On these platforms, bear in mind that the EBCDIC character set may have
       an effect on what happens with some perl functions (such as "chr",
       "pack", "print", "printf", "ord", "sort", "sprintf", "unpack"), as well
       as bit-fiddling with ASCII constants using operators like "^", "&" and
       "|", not to mention dealing with socket interfaces to ASCII computers
       (see "Newlines").

       Fortunately, most web servers for the mainframe will correctly translate
       the "\n" in the following statement to its ASCII equivalent ("\r" is the
       same under both Unix and OS/390):

           print "Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n";

       The values of $^O on some of these platforms includes:

           uname         $^O        $Config{'archname'}
           --------------------------------------------
           OS/390        os390      os390
           OS400         os400      os400
           POSIX-BC      posix-bc   BS2000-posix-bc

       Some simple tricks for determining if you are running on an EBCDIC
       platform could include any of the following (perhaps all):

           if ("\t" eq "\005")   { print "EBCDIC may be spoken here!\n"; }

           if (ord('A') == 193) { print "EBCDIC may be spoken here!\n"; }

           if (chr(169) eq 'z') { print "EBCDIC may be spoken here!\n"; }

       One thing you may not want to rely on is the EBCDIC encoding of
       punctuation characters since these may differ from code page to code page
       (and once your module or script is rumoured to work with EBCDIC, folks
       will want it to work with all EBCDIC character sets).

   Acorn RISC OS
       Because Acorns use ASCII with newlines ("\n") in text files as "\012"
       like Unix, and because Unix filename emulation is turned on by default,
       most simple scripts will probably work "out of the box".  The native
       filesystem is modular, and individual filesystems are free to be case-
       sensitive or insensitive, and are usually case-preserving.  Some native
       filesystems have name length limits, which file and directory names are
       silently truncated to fit.  Scripts should be aware that the standard
       filesystem currently has a name length limit of 10 characters, with up to
       77 items in a directory, but other filesystems may not impose such
       limitations.

       Native filenames are of the form

           Filesystem#Special_Field::DiskName.$.Directory.Directory.File

       where

           Special_Field is not usually present, but may contain . and $ .
           Filesystem =~ m|[A-Za-z0-9_]|
           DsicName   =~ m|[A-Za-z0-9_/]|
           $ represents the root directory
           . is the path separator
           @ is the current directory (per filesystem but machine global)
           ^ is the parent directory
           Directory and File =~ m|[^\0- "\.\$\%\&:\@\\^\|\177]+|

       The default filename translation is roughly "tr|/.|./|;"

       Note that ""ADFS::HardDisk.$.File" ne 'ADFS::HardDisk.$.File'" and that
       the second stage of "$" interpolation in regular expressions will fall
       foul of the $. if scripts are not careful.

       Logical paths specified by system variables containing comma-separated
       search lists are also allowed; hence "System:Modules" is a valid
       filename, and the filesystem will prefix "Modules" with each section of
       "System$Path" until a name is made that points to an object on disk.
       Writing to a new file "System:Modules" would be allowed only if
       "System$Path" contains a single item list.  The filesystem will also
       expand system variables in filenames if enclosed in angle brackets, so
       "<System$Dir>.Modules" would look for the file
       "$ENV{'System$Dir'} . 'Modules'".  The obvious implication of this is
       that fully qualified filenames can start with "<>" and should be
       protected when "open" is used for input.

       Because "." was in use as a directory separator and filenames could not
       be assumed to be unique after 10 characters, Acorn implemented the C
       compiler to strip the trailing ".c" ".h" ".s" and ".o" suffix from
       filenames specified in source code and store the respective files in
       subdirectories named after the suffix.  Hence files are translated:

           foo.h           h.foo
           C:foo.h         C:h.foo        (logical path variable)
           sys/os.h        sys.h.os       (C compiler groks Unix-speak)
           10charname.c    c.10charname
           10charname.o    o.10charname
           11charname_.c   c.11charname   (assuming filesystem truncates at 10)

       The Unix emulation library's translation of filenames to native assumes
       that this sort of translation is required, and it allows a user-defined
       list of known suffixes that it will transpose in this fashion.  This may
       seem transparent, but consider that with these rules foo/bar/baz.h and
       foo/bar/h/baz both map to foo.bar.h.baz, and that "readdir" and "glob"
       cannot and do not attempt to emulate the reverse mapping.  Other "."'s in
       filenames are translated to "/".

       As implied above, the environment accessed through %ENV is global, and
       the convention is that program specific environment variables are of the
       form "Program$Name".  Each filesystem maintains a current directory, and
       the current filesystem's current directory is the global current
       directory.  Consequently, sociable programs don't change the current
       directory but rely on full pathnames, and programs (and Makefiles) cannot
       assume that they can spawn a child process which can change the current
       directory without affecting its parent (and everyone else for that
       matter).

       Because native operating system filehandles are global and are currently
       allocated down from 255, with 0 being a reserved value, the Unix
       emulation library emulates Unix filehandles.  Consequently, you can't
       rely on passing "STDIN", "STDOUT", or "STDERR" to your children.

       The desire of users to express filenames of the form "<Foo$Dir>.Bar" on
       the command line unquoted causes problems, too: "``" command output
       capture has to perform a guessing game.  It assumes that a string
       "<[^<>]+\$[^<>]>" is a reference to an environment variable, whereas
       anything else involving "<" or ">" is redirection, and generally manages
       to be 99% right.  Of course, the problem remains that scripts cannot rely
       on any Unix tools being available, or that any tools found have Unix-like
       command line arguments.

       Extensions and XS are, in theory, buildable by anyone using free tools.
       In practice, many don't, as users of the Acorn platform are used to
       binary distributions.  MakeMaker does run, but no available make
       currently copes with MakeMaker's makefiles; even if and when this should
       be fixed, the lack of a Unix-like shell will cause problems with makefile
       rules, especially lines of the form "cd sdbm && make all", and anything
       using quoting.

       "RISC OS" is the proper name for the operating system, but the value in
       $^O is "riscos" (because we don't like shouting).

   Other perls
       Perl has been ported to many platforms that do not fit into any of the
       categories listed above.  Some, such as AmigaOS, QNX, Plan 9, and VOS,
       have been well-integrated into the standard Perl source code kit.  You
       may need to see the ports/ directory on CPAN for information, and
       possibly binaries, for the likes of: aos, Atari ST, lynxos, riscos,
       Novell Netware, Tandem Guardian, etc.  (Yes, we know that some of these
       OSes may fall under the Unix category, but we are not a standards body.)

       Some approximate operating system names and their $^O values in the
       "OTHER" category include:

           OS            $^O        $Config{'archname'}

FUNCTION IMPLEMENTATIONS
       Listed below are functions that are either completely unimplemented or
       else have been implemented differently on various platforms.  Following
       each description will be, in parentheses, a list of platforms that the
       description applies to.

       The list may well be incomplete, or even wrong in some places.  When in
       doubt, consult the platform-specific README files in the Perl source
       distribution, and any other documentation resources accompanying a given
       port.

       Be aware, moreover, that even among Unix-ish systems there are
       variations.

       For many functions, you can also query %Config, exported by default from
       the Config module.  For example, to check whether the platform has the
       "lstat" call, check $Config{d_lstat}.  See Config for a full description
       of available variables.

   Alphabetical Listing of Perl Functions
       -X      "-w" only inspects the read-only file attribute
               (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READONLY), which determines whether the directory
               can be deleted, not whether it can be written to. Directories
               always have read and write access unless denied by discretionary
               access control lists (DACLs).  (Win32)

               "-r", "-w", "-x", and "-o" tell whether the file is accessible,
               which may not reflect UIC-based file protections.  (VMS)

               "-s" by name on an open file will return the space reserved on
               disk, rather than the current extent.  "-s" on an open filehandle
               returns the current size.  (RISC OS)

               "-R", "-W", "-X", "-O" are indistinguishable from "-r", "-w",
               "-x", "-o". (Win32, VMS, RISC OS)

               "-g", "-k", "-l", "-u", "-A" are not particularly meaningful.
               (Win32, VMS, RISC OS)

               "-p" is not particularly meaningful. (VMS, RISC OS)

               "-d" is true if passed a device spec without an explicit
               directory.  (VMS)

               "-x" (or "-X") determine if a file ends in one of the executable
               suffixes.  "-S" is meaningless.  (Win32)

               "-x" (or "-X") determine if a file has an executable file type.
               (RISC OS)

       alarm   Emulated using timers that must be explicitly polled whenever
               Perl wants to dispatch "safe signals" and therefore cannot
               interrupt blocking system calls.  (Win32)

       atan2   Due to issues with various CPUs, math libraries, compilers, and
               standards, results for "atan2()" may vary depending on any
               combination of the above.  Perl attempts to conform to the Open
               Group/IEEE standards for the results returned from "atan2()", but
               cannot force the issue if the system Perl is run on does not
               allow it.  (Tru64, HP-UX 10.20)

               The current version of the standards for "atan2()" is available
               at
               <http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/atan2.html>.

       binmode Meaningless.  (RISC OS)

               Reopens file and restores pointer; if function fails, underlying
               filehandle may be closed, or pointer may be in a different
               position.  (VMS)

               The value returned by "tell" may be affected after the call, and
               the filehandle may be flushed. (Win32)

       chmod   Only good for changing "owner" read-write access, "group", and
               "other" bits are meaningless. (Win32)

               Only good for changing "owner" and "other" read-write access.
               (RISC OS)

               Access permissions are mapped onto VOS access-control list
               changes. (VOS)

               The actual permissions set depend on the value of the "CYGWIN" in
               the SYSTEM environment settings.  (Cygwin)

       chown   Not implemented. (Win32, Plan 9, RISC OS)

               Does nothing, but won't fail. (Win32)

               A little funky, because VOS's notion of ownership is a little
               funky (VOS).

       chroot  Not implemented. (Win32, VMS, Plan 9, RISC OS, VOS)

       crypt   May not be available if library or source was not provided when
               building perl. (Win32)

       dbmclose
               Not implemented. (VMS, Plan 9, VOS)

       dbmopen Not implemented. (VMS, Plan 9, VOS)

       dump    Not useful. (RISC OS)

               Not supported. (Cygwin, Win32)

               Invokes VMS debugger. (VMS)

       exec    Does not automatically flush output handles on some platforms.
               (SunOS, Solaris, HP-UX)

               Not supported. (Symbian OS)

       exit    Emulates Unix exit() (which considers "exit 1" to indicate an
               error) by mapping the 1 to SS$_ABORT (44).  This behavior may be
               overridden with the pragma "use vmsish 'exit'".  As with the
               CRTL's exit() function, "exit 0" is also mapped to an exit status
               of SS$_NORMAL (1); this mapping cannot be overridden.  Any other
               argument to exit() is used directly as Perl's exit status.  On
               VMS, unless the future POSIX_EXIT mode is enabled, the exit code
               should always be a valid VMS exit code and not a generic number.
               When the POSIX_EXIT mode is enabled, a generic number will be
               encoded in a method compatible with the C library _POSIX_EXIT
               macro so that it can be decoded by other programs, particularly
               ones written in C, like the GNV package.  (VMS)

               "exit()" resets file pointers, which is a problem when called
               from a child process (created by "fork()") in "BEGIN".  A
               workaround is to use "POSIX::_exit".  (Solaris)

                   exit unless $Config{archname} =~ /\bsolaris\b/;
                   require POSIX and POSIX::_exit(0);

       fcntl   Not implemented. (Win32)

               Some functions available based on the version of VMS. (VMS)

       flock   Not implemented (VMS, RISC OS, VOS).

       fork    Not implemented. (AmigaOS, RISC OS, VMS)

               Emulated using multiple interpreters.  See perlfork.  (Win32)

               Does not automatically flush output handles on some platforms.
               (SunOS, Solaris, HP-UX)

       getlogin
               Not implemented. (RISC OS)

       getpgrp Not implemented. (Win32, VMS, RISC OS)

       getppid Not implemented. (Win32, RISC OS)

       getpriority
               Not implemented. (Win32, VMS, RISC OS, VOS)

       getpwnam
               Not implemented. (Win32)

               Not useful. (RISC OS)

       getgrnam
               Not implemented. (Win32, VMS, RISC OS)

       getnetbyname
               Not implemented. (Win32, Plan 9)

       getpwuid
               Not implemented. (Win32)

               Not useful. (RISC OS)

       getgrgid
               Not implemented. (Win32, VMS, RISC OS)

       getnetbyaddr
               Not implemented. (Win32, Plan 9)

       getprotobynumber
       getservbyport
       getpwent
               Not implemented. (Win32)

       getgrent
               Not implemented. (Win32, VMS)

       gethostbyname
               "gethostbyname('localhost')" does not work everywhere: you may
               have to use "gethostbyname('127.0.0.1')". (Irix 5)

       gethostent
               Not implemented. (Win32)

       getnetent
               Not implemented. (Win32, Plan 9)

       getprotoent
               Not implemented. (Win32, Plan 9)

       getservent
               Not implemented. (Win32, Plan 9)

       sethostent
               Not implemented. (Win32, Plan 9, RISC OS)

       setnetent
               Not implemented. (Win32, Plan 9, RISC OS)

       setprotoent
               Not implemented. (Win32, Plan 9, RISC OS)

       setservent
               Not implemented. (Plan 9, Win32, RISC OS)

       endpwent
               Not implemented. (Win32)

       endgrent
               Not implemented. (RISC OS, VMS, Win32)

       endhostent
               Not implemented. (Win32)

       endnetent
               Not implemented. (Win32, Plan 9)

       endprotoent
               Not implemented. (Win32, Plan 9)

       endservent
               Not implemented. (Plan 9, Win32)

       getsockopt SOCKET,LEVEL,OPTNAME
               Not implemented. (Plan 9)

       glob    This operator is implemented via the File::Glob extension on most
               platforms.  See File::Glob for portability information.

       gmtime  In theory, gmtime() is reliable from -2**63 to 2**63-1.  However,
               because work arounds in the implementation use floating point
               numbers, it will become inaccurate as the time gets larger.  This
               is a bug and will be fixed in the future.

               On VOS, time values are 32-bit quantities.

       ioctl FILEHANDLE,FUNCTION,SCALAR
               Not implemented. (VMS)

               Available only for socket handles, and it does what the
               ioctlsocket() call in the Winsock API does. (Win32)

               Available only for socket handles. (RISC OS)

       kill    Not implemented, hence not useful for taint checking. (RISC OS)

               "kill()" doesn't have the semantics of "raise()", i.e. it doesn't
               send a signal to the identified process like it does on Unix
               platforms.  Instead "kill($sig, $pid)" terminates the process
               identified by $pid, and makes it exit immediately with exit
               status $sig.  As in Unix, if $sig is 0 and the specified process
               exists, it returns true without actually terminating it. (Win32)

               "kill(-9, $pid)" will terminate the process specified by $pid and
               recursively all child processes owned by it.  This is different
               from the Unix semantics, where the signal will be delivered to
               all processes in the same process group as the process specified
               by $pid. (Win32)

               Is not supported for process identification number of 0 or
               negative numbers. (VMS)

       link    Not implemented. (RISC OS, VOS)

               Link count not updated because hard links are not quite that hard
               (They are sort of half-way between hard and soft links).
               (AmigaOS)

               Hard links are implemented on Win32 under NTFS only. They are
               natively supported on Windows 2000 and later.  On Windows NT they
               are implemented using the Windows POSIX subsystem support and the
               Perl process will need Administrator or Backup Operator
               privileges to create hard links.

               Available on 64 bit OpenVMS 8.2 and later.  (VMS)

       localtime
               localtime() has the same range as "gmtime", but because time zone
               rules change its accuracy for historical and future times may
               degrade but usually by no more than an hour.

       lstat   Not implemented. (RISC OS)

               Return values (especially for device and inode) may be bogus.
               (Win32)

       msgctl
       msgget
       msgsnd
       msgrcv  Not implemented. (Win32, VMS, Plan 9, RISC OS, VOS)

       open    open to "|-" and "-|" are unsupported. (Win32, RISC OS)

               Opening a process does not automatically flush output handles on
               some platforms.  (SunOS, Solaris, HP-UX)

       readlink
               Not implemented. (Win32, VMS, RISC OS)

       rename  Can't move directories between directories on different logical
               volumes. (Win32)

       rewinddir
               Will not cause readdir() to re-read the directory stream.  The
               entries already read before the rewinddir() call will just be
               returned again from a cache buffer. (Win32)

       select  Only implemented on sockets. (Win32, VMS)

               Only reliable on sockets. (RISC OS)

               Note that the "select FILEHANDLE" form is generally portable.

       semctl
       semget
       semop   Not implemented. (Win32, VMS, RISC OS)

       setgrent
               Not implemented. (VMS, Win32, RISC OS)

       setpgrp Not implemented. (Win32, VMS, RISC OS, VOS)

       setpriority
               Not implemented. (Win32, VMS, RISC OS, VOS)

       setpwent
               Not implemented. (Win32, RISC OS)

       setsockopt
               Not implemented. (Plan 9)

       shmctl
       shmget
       shmread
       shmwrite
               Not implemented. (Win32, VMS, RISC OS)

       sleep   Emulated using synchronization functions such that it can be
               interrupted by alarm(), and limited to a maximum of 4294967
               seconds, approximately 49 days. (Win32)

       sockatmark
               A relatively recent addition to socket functions, may not be
               implemented even in Unix platforms.

       socketpair
               Not implemented. (RISC OS)

               Available on 64 bit OpenVMS 8.2 and later.  (VMS)

       stat    Platforms that do not have rdev, blksize, or blocks will return
               these as '', so numeric comparison or manipulation of these
               fields may cause 'not numeric' warnings.

               ctime not supported on UFS (Mac OS X).

               ctime is creation time instead of inode change time  (Win32).

               device and inode are not meaningful.  (Win32)

               device and inode are not necessarily reliable.  (VMS)

               mtime, atime and ctime all return the last modification time.
               Device and inode are not necessarily reliable.  (RISC OS)

               dev, rdev, blksize, and blocks are not available.  inode is not
               meaningful and will differ between stat calls on the same file.
               (os2)

               some versions of cygwin when doing a stat("foo") and if not
               finding it may then attempt to stat("foo.exe") (Cygwin)

               On Win32 stat() needs to open the file to determine the link
               count and update attributes that may have been changed through
               hard links.  Setting ${^WIN32_SLOPPY_STAT} to a true value speeds
               up stat() by not performing this operation. (Win32)

       symlink Not implemented. (Win32, RISC OS)

               Implemented on 64 bit VMS 8.3.  VMS requires the symbolic link to
               be in Unix syntax if it is intended to resolve to a valid path.

       syscall Not implemented. (Win32, VMS, RISC OS, VOS)

       sysopen The traditional "0", "1", and "2" MODEs are implemented with
               different numeric values on some systems.  The flags exported by
               "Fcntl" (O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR) should work everywhere
               though.  (Mac OS, OS/390)

       system  As an optimization, may not call the command shell specified in
               $ENV{PERL5SHELL}.  "system(1, @args)" spawns an external process
               and immediately returns its process designator, without waiting
               for it to terminate.  Return value may be used subsequently in
               "wait" or "waitpid".  Failure to spawn() a subprocess is
               indicated by setting $? to "255 << 8".  $? is set in a way
               compatible with Unix (i.e. the exitstatus of the subprocess is
               obtained by "$? >> 8", as described in the documentation).
               (Win32)

               There is no shell to process metacharacters, and the native
               standard is to pass a command line terminated by "\n" "\r" or
               "\0" to the spawned program.  Redirection such as "> foo" is
               performed (if at all) by the run time library of the spawned
               program.  "system" list will call the Unix emulation library's
               "exec" emulation, which attempts to provide emulation of the
               stdin, stdout, stderr in force in the parent, providing the child
               program uses a compatible version of the emulation library.
               scalar will call the native command line direct and no such
               emulation of a child Unix program will exists.  Mileage will
               vary.  (RISC OS)

               Does not automatically flush output handles on some platforms.
               (SunOS, Solaris, HP-UX)

               The return value is POSIX-like (shifted up by 8 bits), which only
               allows room for a made-up value derived from the severity bits of
               the native 32-bit condition code (unless overridden by "use
               vmsish 'status'").  If the native condition code is one that has
               a POSIX value encoded, the POSIX value will be decoded to extract
               the expected exit value.  For more details see "$?" in perlvms.
               (VMS)

       times   "cumulative" times will be bogus.  On anything other than Windows
               NT or Windows 2000, "system" time will be bogus, and "user" time
               is actually the time returned by the clock() function in the C
               runtime library. (Win32)

               Not useful. (RISC OS)

       truncate
               Not implemented. (Older versions of VMS)

               Truncation to same-or-shorter lengths only. (VOS)

               If a FILEHANDLE is supplied, it must be writable and opened in
               append mode (i.e., use "open(FH, '>>filename')" or
               "sysopen(FH,...,O_APPEND|O_RDWR)".  If a filename is supplied, it
               should not be held open elsewhere. (Win32)

       umask   Returns undef where unavailable.

               "umask" works but the correct permissions are set only when the
               file is finally closed. (AmigaOS)

       utime   Only the modification time is updated. (VMS, RISC OS)

               May not behave as expected.  Behavior depends on the C runtime
               library's implementation of utime(), and the filesystem being
               used.  The FAT filesystem typically does not support an "access
               time" field, and it may limit timestamps to a granularity of two
               seconds. (Win32)

       wait
       waitpid Can only be applied to process handles returned for processes
               spawned using "system(1, ...)" or pseudo processes created with
               "fork()". (Win32)

               Not useful. (RISC OS)

       The following platforms worked with the previous releases (5.6 and 5.7),
       but we did not manage either to fix or to test these in time for the
       5.8.0 release.  There is a very good chance that many of these will work
       fine with the 5.8.0.

               AmigaOS

       The following platforms have been known to build Perl from source in the
       past (5.005_03 and earlier), but we haven't been able to verify their
       status for the current release, either because the hardware/software
       platforms are rare or because we don't have an active champion on these
       platforms--or both.  They used to work, though, so go ahead and try
       compiling them, and let perlbug@perl.org of any trouble.

               LynxOS                  5.004_02

       Although we do suggest that you always build your own Perl from the
       source code, both for maximal configurability and for security, in case
       you are in a hurry you can check <http://www.cpan.org/ports/index.html>
       for binary distributions.
