SYNOPSIS
     auval [--32] [-s TYPE] [-a] [-v|vt TYPE SUBT MANU [-w] [-de] [-dw]]
           [-f file]

DESCRIPTION
     AUValidation tests a specified AudioUnit for API and behavioural
     conformance.  returns: OK: 0, malformed execution: 1, unit not conformant:
     -1

OPTIONS
     -32      must be specified first. run in 32 bit mode. If not specified,
              runs as 64 bit native architecture

     -h       print help text

     -a       lists all available AudioUnits of any type

     -s TYPE  lists all available AudioUnits of type 'TYPE'

     -v TYPE SUBT MANU
              opens the AudioUnit specified by the TYPE SUBT MANU component ID's
              and tests that unit.

     -vt TYPE MANU
              iterates through all of the AU's of specified TYPE and MANU

     -de      execution is terminated when first error is encountered

     -dw      execution is terminated when first warning is encountered

     -c       continue validating when an error occurs in batch mode.

     -q       quiet - does no printing except for errors or warnings

     -qp      doesn't print parameter or Factory Presets information

     -o       only runs a basic open and initialize test. good for debugging
              basic functionality

     -r N     repeat the whole process of validation N times. good for catching
              open/init bugs.

     -w       wait after finished - good for profiling memory usage see 'man
              leaks'
