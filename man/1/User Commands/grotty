NAME
       grotty - groff driver for typewriter-like devices

SYNOPSIS
       grotty [ -bBcdfhioruUv ] [ -Fdir ] [ files... ]

       It is possible to have whitespace between the -F option and its parame-
       ter.

DESCRIPTION
       grotty translates the output of GNU troff  into  a  form  suitable  for
       typewriter-like  devices.   Normally  grotty should be invoked by using
       the groff command with a -Tascii, -Tlatin1 or -Tutf8  option  on  ASCII
       based  systems, and with -Tcp1047 and -Tutf8 on EBCDIC based hosts.  If
       no files are given, grotty will read the standard input.  A filename of
       - will also cause grotty to read the standard input.  Output is written
       to the standard output.

       By default, grotty emits SGR escape  sequences  (from  ISO  6429,  also
       called  ANSI  color  escapes)  to change text attributes (bold, italic,
       colors).  This makes it possible to have eight different background and
       foreground colors; additionally, bold and italic attributes can be used
       at the same time (by using the BI font).

       The following colors are defined in tty.tmac: black, white, red, green,
       blue,  yellow, magenta, cyan.  Unknown colors are mapped to the default
       color (which is dependent on the settings  of  the  terminal;  in  most
       cases,  this is black for the foreground and white for the background).

       Use the -c switch to revert to the old behaviour, printing a bold char-
       acter  c with the sequence `c BACKSPACE c' and an italic character c by
       the sequence `_ BACKSPACE c'.  At the same time, color output  is  dis-
       abled.   The  same  effect  can  be  achieved  by  setting  either  the
       GROFF_NO_SGR environment variable or using the  `sgr'  X  command  (see
       below).

       For  SGR  support,  it  is necessary to use the -R option of less(1) to
       disable the interpretation  of  grotty's  old  output  format.   Conse-
       quently,  all programs which use less as the pager program have to pass
       this option to it.  For man(1) in particular,  either  add  -R  to  the
       $PAGER environment variable, e.g.

              PAGER="/usr/bin/less -R"
              export PAGER

       or  use  the  -P  option  of  man  to  set the pager executable and its
       options, or modify the configuration file of man in a similar  fashion.

       grotty's  old  output  format  can be displayed on a terminal by piping
       through ul(1).  Pagers such as more(1) or less(1) are also able to dis-
       play  these  sequences.   Use either -B or -U when piping into less(1);
       use -b when piping into more(1).  There is no need to filter the output
       through col(1) since grotty never outputs reverse line feeds.

       The font description file may contain a command

              internalname n

       where n is a decimal integer.  If the 01 bit in n is set, then the font
       will be treated as an italic font; if the 02 bit is set, then  it  will
       be  treated  as  a  bold  font.  The code field in the font description
       field gives the code which will be used to output the character.   This
       code can also be used in the \N escape sequence in troff.

OPTIONS
       -b     Suppress  the  use of overstriking for bold characters.  Ignored
              if -c isn't used.

       -B     Use only overstriking for bold-italic characters.  Ignored if -c
              isn't used.

       -c     Use  grotty's old output format (see above).  This also disables
              color output.

       -d     Ignore  all  \D  commands.   Without  this  grotty  will  render
              \D'l...'  commands  that have at least one zero argument (and so
              are either horizontal or vertical) using -, |, and + characters.

       -f     Use form feeds in the output.  A form feed will be output at the
              end of each page that has no output on its last line.

       -Fdir  Prepend directory dir/devname to the search path  for  font  and
              device  description  files; name is the name of the device, usu-
              ally ascii, latin1, utf8, or cp1047.

       -h     Use horizontal tabs in the output.  Tabs are assumed to  be  set
              every 8 columns.

       -i     Use escape sequences to set the italic text attribute instead of
              the underline attribute for italic fonts (`I' and  `BI').   Note
              that  most  terminals  (including  xterm)  don't  support  this.
              Ignored if -c is active.

       -o     Suppress overstriking (other than for bold or underlined charac-
              ters  in case the old output format has been activated with -c).

       -r     Use escape sequences to set the reverse text  attribute  instead
              of  the  underline  attribute  for  italic fonts (`I' and `BI').
              Ignored if -c is active.

       -u     Suppress the use of underlining for italic characters.   Ignored
              if -c isn't used.

       -U     Use  only underlining for bold-italic characters.  Ignored if -c
              isn't used.

       -v     Print the version number.

USAGE
       grotty understands a single X command  produced  using  the  \X  escape
       sequence.

       \X'tty: sgr n'
              If  n  is  non-zero  or  missing, enable SGR output (this is the
              default), otherwise use the old  drawing  scheme  for  bold  and
              underline.

ENVIRONMENT
       GROFF_NO_SGR
              If set, the old drawing scheme for bold and underline (using the
              backspace character) is active.  Colors are disabled.

BUGS
       grotty is intended only for simple documents.

       There is no support for fractional horizontal or vertical motions.

       There  is no support for \D commands other than horizontal and vertical
       lines.

       Characters above the first line (ie with a vertical position of 0) can-
       not be printed.

       Color  handling  is different compared to grops(1).  \M doesn't set the
       fill color for closed graphic objects  (which  grotty  doesn't  support
       anyway) but changes the background color of the character cell, affect-
       ing all subsequent operations.
