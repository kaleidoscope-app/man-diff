NAME
       perl5241delta - what is new for perl v5.24.1

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes differences between the 5.24.0 release and the
       5.24.1 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.22.0, first read
       perl5240delta, which describes differences between 5.22.0 and 5.24.0.

Security
   -Di switch is now required for PerlIO debugging output
       Previously PerlIO debugging output would be sent to the file specified by
       the "PERLIO_DEBUG" environment variable if perl wasn't running setuid and
       the -T or -t switches hadn't been parsed yet.

       If perl performed output at a point where it hadn't yet parsed its
       switches this could result in perl creating or overwriting the file named
       by "PERLIO_DEBUG" even when the -T switch had been supplied.

       Perl now requires the -Di switch to produce PerlIO debugging output.  By
       default this is written to "stderr", but can optionally be redirected to
       a file by setting the "PERLIO_DEBUG" environment variable.

       If perl is running setuid or the -T switch was supplied "PERLIO_DEBUG" is
       ignored and the debugging output is sent to "stderr" as for any other -D
       switch.

   Core modules and tools no longer search "." for optional modules
       The tools and many modules supplied in core no longer search the default
       current directory entry in @INC for optional modules.  For example,
       Storable will remove the final "." from @INC before trying to load
       Log::Agent.

       This prevents an attacker injecting an optional module into a process run
       by another user where the current directory is writable by the attacker,
       e.g. the /tmp directory.

       In most cases this removal should not cause problems, but difficulties
       were encountered with base, which treats every module name supplied as
       optional.  These difficulties have not yet been resolved, so for this
       release there are no changes to base.  We hope to have a fix for base in
       Perl 5.24.2.

       To protect your own code from this attack, either remove the default "."
       entry from @INC at the start of your script, so:

         #!/usr/bin/perl
         use strict;
         ...

       becomes:

         #!/usr/bin/perl
         BEGIN { pop @INC if $INC[-1] eq '.' }
         use strict;
         ...

       or for modules, remove "." from a localized @INC, so:

         my $can_foo = eval { require Foo; }

       becomes:

         my $can_foo = eval {
             local @INC = @INC;
             pop @INC if $INC[-1] eq '.';
             require Foo;
         };

Incompatible Changes
       Other than the security changes above there are no changes intentionally
       incompatible with Perl 5.24.0.  If any exist, they are bugs, and we
       request that you submit a report.  See "Reporting Bugs" below.

Documentation
   Changes to Existing Documentation
       perlapio

       •   The documentation of "PERLIO_DEBUG" has been updated.

       perlrun

       •   The new -Di switch has been documented, and the documentation of
           "PERLIO_DEBUG" has been updated.

Testing
       •   A new test script, t/run/switchDx.t, has been added to test that the
           new -Di switch is working correctly.

Selected Bug Fixes
       •   The change to hashbang redirection introduced in Perl 5.24.0, whereby
           perl would redirect to another interpreter (Perl 6) if it found a
           hashbang path which contains "perl" followed by "6", has been
           reverted because it broke in cases such as "#!/opt/perl64/bin/perl".

Acknowledgements
       Perl 5.24.1 represents approximately 8 months of development since Perl
       5.24.0 and contains approximately 8,100 lines of changes across 240 files
       from 18 authors.

       Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there
       were approximately 2,200 lines of changes to 170 .pm, .t, .c and .h
       files.

       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant
       community of users and developers.  The following people are known to
       have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.24.1:

       Aaron Crane, Alex Vandiver, Aristotle Pagaltzis, Chad Granum, Chris
       'BinGOs' Williams, Craig A. Berry, Father Chrysostomos, James E Keenan,

       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
       generated from version control history.  In particular, it does not
       include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
       modules included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN
       community for helping Perl to flourish.

Reporting Bugs
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
       recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the Perl bug
       database at <https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
       <http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
       included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
       sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of "perl
       -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
       porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
       "SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec for details of
       how to report the issue.
