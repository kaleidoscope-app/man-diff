db_stat(1)                   General Commands Manual                  db_stat(1)

NAME
     db_stat

SYNOPSIS
     db_stat -d file [-fN] [-h home] [-P password] [-s database]
     db_stat [-celmNrtVZ] [-C Aclmop] [-h home] [-M Ahm] [-P password]

DESCRIPTION
     The db_stat utility utility displays statistics for Berkeley DB
     environments.

     The options are as follows:

     -C
       Display internal information about the lock region. (The output from this
       option is often both voluminous and meaningless, and is intended only for
       debugging.)

       A
         Display all information.

       c
         Display lock conflict matrix.

       l
         Display lockers within hash chains.

       m
         Display region memory information.

       o
         Display objects within hash chains.

       p
         Display lock region parameters.

     -c
       Display lock region statistics, as described in DB_ENV->lock_stat.

     -d
       Display database statistics for the specified file, as described in
       DB->stat.

       If the database contains multiple databases and the -s flag is not
       specified, the statistics are for the internal database that describes
       the other databases the file contains, and not for the file as a whole.

     -e
       Display current environment statistics.

     -f
       Display only those database statistics that can be acquired without
       traversing the database.

     -h
       Specify a home directory for the database environment; by default, the
       current working directory is used.

     -l
       Display log region statistics, as described in DB_ENV->log_stat.

     -M
       Display internal information about the shared memory buffer pool. (The
       output from this option is often both voluminous and meaningless, and is
       intended only for debugging.)

       A
         Display all information.

       h
         Display buffers within hash chains.

       m
         Display region memory information.

     -m
       Display shared memory buffer pool statistics, as described in
       DB_ENV->memp_stat.

     -N
       Do not acquire shared region mutexes while running. Other problems, such
       as potentially fatal errors in Berkeley DB, will be ignored as well. This
       option is intended only for debugging errors, and should not be used
       under any other circumstances.

     -P
       Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite
       password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a window of
       vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see command-line
       arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory
       containing the command-line arguments.

     -r
       Display replication statistics, as described in DB_ENV->rep_stat.

     -s
       Display statistics for the specified database contained in the file
       specified with the -d flag.

     -t
       Display transaction region statistics, as described in DB_ENV->txn_stat.

     -V
       Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

     -Z
       Reset the statistics after reporting them; valid only with the -c, -e,
       -l, -m, and -t options.

     Values normally displayed in quantities of bytes are displayed as a
     combination of gigabytes (GB), megabytes (MB), kilobytes (KB), and bytes
     (B). Otherwise, values smaller than 10 million are displayed without any
     special notation, and values larger than 10 million are displayed as a
     number followed by "M".

     The db_stat utility may be used with a Berkeley DB environment (as
     described for the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because
     the utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment).
     In order to avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB
     environment, db_stat should always be given the chance to detach from the
     environment and exit gracefully. To cause db_stat to release all
     environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal
     (SIGINT).

     The db_stat utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

ENVIRONMENT
     DB_HOME  If the -h option is not specified and the environment variable
              DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as
              described in DB_ENV->open.
