PCAP-CONFIG(1)               General Commands Manual              PCAP-CONFIG(1)



NAME
       pcap-config - write libpcap compiler and linker flags to standard output

SYNOPSIS
       pcap-config [ --static ] [ --cflags | --libs | --additional-libs ]

DESCRIPTION
       When run with the --cflags option, pcap-config writes to the standard
       output the -I compiler flags required to include libpcap's header files.
       When run with the --libs option, pcap-config writes to the standard
       output the -L and -l linker flags required to link with libpcap,
       including -l flags for libraries required by libpcap.  When run with the
       --additional-libs option, pcap-config writes to the standard output the
       -L and -l flags for libraries required by libpcap, but not the -lpcap
       flag to link with libpcap itself.

       By default, it writes flags appropriate for compiling with a dynamically-
       linked version of libpcap; the --static flag causes it to write flags
       appropriate for compiling with a statically-linked version of libpcap.
