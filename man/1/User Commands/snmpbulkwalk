SNMPBULKWALK(1)                     Net-SNMP                     SNMPBULKWALK(1)



NAME
       snmpbulkwalk - retrieve a subtree of management values using SNMP GETBULK
       requests

SYNOPSIS
       snmpbulkwalk [APPLICATION OPTIONS] [COMMON OPTIONS] AGENT [OID]

DESCRIPTION
       snmpbulkwalk is an SNMP application that uses SNMP GETBULK requests to
       query a network entity efficiently for a tree of information.

       An object identifier (OID) may be given on the command line.  This OID
       specifies which portion of the object identifier space will be searched
       using GETBULK requests.  All variables in the subtree below the given OID
       are queried and their values presented to the user.  Each variable name
       is given in the format specified in variables(5).  If no OID argument is
       present, snmpbulkwalk will search MIB-2.

       If the network entity has an error processing the request packet, an
       error packet will be returned and a message will be shown, helping to
       pinpoint why the request was malformed.

       If the tree search causes attempts to search beyond the end of the MIB,
       the message "End of MIB" will be displayed.

OPTIONS
       -Cc     Do not check whether the returned OIDs are increasing.  Some
               agents (LaserJets are an example) return OIDs out of order, but
               can complete the walk anyway.  Other agents return OIDs that are
               out of order and can cause snmpbulkwalk to loop indefinitely.  By
               default, snmpbulkwalk tries to detect this behavior and warns you
               when it hits an agent acting illegally.  Use -Cc to turn off this
               behaviour.

       -Ci     Include the given OID in the search range.  Normally snmpbulkwalk
               uses GETBULK requests starting with the OID you specified and
               returns all results in the MIB tree after that OID.  Sometimes,
               you may wish to include the OID specified on the command line in
               the printed results if it is a valid OID in the tree itself.
               This option lets you do this.

       -Cn<NUM>
               Set the non-repeaters field in the GETBULK PDUs.  This specifies
               the number of supplied variables that should not be iterated
               over.  The default is 0.

       -Cp     Upon completion of the walk, print the number of variables found.

       -Cr<NUM>
               Set the max-repetitions field in the GETBULK PDUs.  This
               specifies the maximum number of iterations over the repeating
               variables.  The default is 10.

       In addition to these options, snmpbulkwalk takes the common options
       described in the snmpcmd(1) manual page.  Note that snmpbulkget REQUIRES
       an argument specifying the agent to query and at most one OID argument,
       as described above.

EXAMPLE
       The command:

       snmpbulkwalk -v2c -Os -c public zeus system

       will retrieve all of the variables under system:

       sysDescr.0 = STRING: "SunOS zeus.net.cmu.edu 4.1.3_U1 1 sun4m"
       sysObjectID.0 = OID: enterprises.hp.nm.hpsystem.10.1.1
       sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks: (155274552) 17 days, 23:19:05
       sysContact.0 = STRING: ""
       sysName.0 = STRING: "zeus.net.cmu.edu"
       sysLocation.0 = STRING: ""
       sysServices.0 = INTEGER: 72

       In contrast to snmpwalk, this information will typically be gathered in a
       single transaction with the agent, rather than one transaction per
       variable found.  snmpbulkwalk is thus more efficient in terms of network
       utilisation, which may be especially important when retrieving large
       tables.

NOTE
       As the name implies, snmpbulkwalk utilizes the SNMP GETBULK message,
       which is not available in SNMP v1.
