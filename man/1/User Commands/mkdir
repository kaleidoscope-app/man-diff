MKDIR(1)                     General Commands Manual                    MKDIR(1)

NAME
     mkdir – make directories

SYNOPSIS
     mkdir [-pv] [-m mode] directory_name ...

DESCRIPTION
     The mkdir utility creates the directories named as operands, in the order
     specified, using mode rwxrwxrwx (0777) as modified by the current umask(2).

     The options are as follows:

     -m mode
             Set the file permission bits of the final created directory to the
             specified mode.  The mode argument can be in any of the formats
             specified to the chmod(1) command.  If a symbolic mode is
             specified, the operation characters “+” and “-” are interpreted
             relative to an initial mode of “a=rwx”.

     -p      Create intermediate directories as required.  If this option is not
             specified, the full path prefix of each operand must already exist.
             On the other hand, with this option specified, no error will be
             reported if a directory given as an operand already exists.
             Intermediate directories are created with permission bits of
             rwxrwxrwx (0777) as modified by the current umask, plus write and
             search permission for the owner.

     -v      Be verbose when creating directories, listing them as they are
             created.

     The user must have write permission in the parent directory.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The mkdir utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

SEE ALSO
     rmdir(1)

COMPATIBILITY
     The -v option is non-standard and its use in scripts is not recommended.

STANDARDS
     The mkdir utility is expected to be IEEE Std 1003.2 (“POSIX.2”) compatible.

HISTORY
     A mkdir command appeared in Version 1 AT&T UNIX.
