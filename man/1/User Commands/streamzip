STREAMZIP(1)            Perl Programmers Reference Guide            STREAMZIP(1)




NAME
       streamzip - create a zip file from stdin

SYNOPSIS
           producer | streamzip [opts] | consumer
           producer | streamzip [opts] -zipfile=output.zip

DESCRIPTION
       This program will read data from "stdin", compress it into a zip
       container and, by default, write a streamed zip file to "stdout". No
       temporary files are created.

       The zip container written to "stdout" is, by necessity, written in
       streaming format. Most programs that read Zip files can cope with a
       streamed zip file, but if interoperability is important, and your
       workflow allows you to write the zip file directly to disk you can create
       a non-streamed zip file using the "zipfile" option.

   OPTIONS
       -zip64
            Create a Zip64-compliant zip container. Use this option if the input
            is greater than 4Gig.

            Default is disabled.

       -zipfile=F
            Write zip container to the filename "F".

            Use the "Stream" option to force the creation of a streamed zip
            file.

       -member-name=M
            This option is used to name the "file" in the zip container.

            Default is '-'.

       -stream
            Ignored when writing to "stdout".

            If the "zipfile" option is specified, including this option will
            trigger the creation of a streamed zip file.

            Default: Always enabled when writing to "stdout", otherwise
            disabled.

       -method=M
            Compress using method "M".

            Valid method names are

                * store    Store without compression
                * deflate  Use Deflate compression [Deflault]
                * bzip2    Use Bzip2 compression
                * lzma     Use LZMA compression
                * xz       Use xz compression
                * zstd     Use Zstandard compression

            Note that Lzma compress needs "IO::Compress::Lzma" to be installed.

            Note that Zstd compress needs "IO::Compress::Zstd" to be installed.

            Default is "deflate".

       -0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9
            Sets the compression level for "deflate". Ignored for all other
            compression methods.

            "-0" means no compression and "-9" for maximum compression.

            Default is 6

       -version
            Display version number

       -help
            Display help

   Examples
       Create a zip file bt reading daa from stdin

           $ echo Lorem ipsum dolor sit | perl ./bin/streamzip >abcd.zip

       Check the contents of "abcd,zip" with the standard "unzip" utility

           Archive:  abcd.zip
             Length      Date    Time    Name
           ---------  ---------- -----   ----
                  22  2021-01-08 19:45   -
           ---------                     -------
                  22                     1 file

       Notice how the "Name" is set to "-".  That is the default for a few zip
       utilities whwre the member name is not given.

       If you want to explicitly name the file, use the "-member-name" option as
       follows

           $ echo Lorem ipsum dolor sit | perl ./bin/streamzip -member-name latin >abcd.zip

           $ unzip -l abcd.zip
           Archive:  abcd.zip
             Length      Date    Time    Name
           ---------  ---------- -----   ----
                  22  2021-01-08 19:47   latin
           ---------                     -------
                  22                     1 file

   When to write a Streamed Zip File
       A Streamed Zip File is useful in situations where you cannot seek
       backwards/forwards in the file.

       A good examples is when you are serving dynamic content from a Web Server
       straight into a socket without needing to create a temporary zip file in
       the filesystsm.

       Similarly if your workfow uses a Linux pipelined commands.
