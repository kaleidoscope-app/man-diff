NAME

SYNOPSIS
     dsimport filepath nodepath O|M|A|I|N [options]
     dsimport --version
     dsimport --help

DESCRIPTION
     dsimport is a tool for importing records into an Open Directory source.

USAGE
     filepath   is the path of the file to be imported.

     nodepath   is the path of the Open Directory node where the records should
                be imported.

     A flag that specifies how to handle conflicting records:

                O        overwrite of any existing records that have the same
                         record name, UID or GID. All previous attribute values
                         are deleted.

                M        merge import data with existing records or create the
                         record if it does not exist.

                I        ignore the record if there is a conflicting name, UID
                         or GID.

                A        append the data to existing records, but do not create
                         a record if it does not exist.

                N        no duplicate checking should be done.  Note this could
                         cause failures and/or a slower import process.

     A list of options and their descriptions:

     --crypt
       is used to signify that all user passwords are crypt-based. Entries in
       the import file can also be prefixed with {CRYPT} on a per record basis
       if not all users are crypt-based.  By default all passwords are assumed
       to be provided as listed in the import file.

     --force attribute value
       forces a specific value for the named attribute for all records during
       the import. The new value will overwrite any value specified in the
       import file. This option may be specified multiple times for forcing more
       than one attribute.

     --groupid value
       is the GID used for any records that do not specify a primary GID.

     --grouppreset value
       designate a preset record to be applied to imported group records.

     --loglevel value
       changes the amount of logging detail output to the log file.

     --outputfile value
       Outputs a plist to the specified file with a list of changed users or
       groups and rejected records due to name conflicts.  Also includes a list
       of deleted records (overwrite mode), and lists of records that failed and
       succeeded during import.  The format of this file is likely to change in
       a future release of Mac OS X.

     --password value
       is the admin's password for import operations. Used to authenticate to
       the directory node during import. A secure prompt will be used for
       interactive input if not supplied via parameter.  Using the prompt method
       is the most secure method of providing password to dsimport.

     --recordformat string
       passes in the delimiters and attributes and record type to specify the
       order and names of attributes in the file to be imported. An example
       record format string:

       0x0A 0x5C 0x3A 0x2C dsRecTypeStandard:Users 7
       dsAttrTypeStandard:RecordName dsAttrTypeStandard:Password
       dsAttrTypeStandard:UniqueID dsAttrTypeStandard:PrimaryGroupID
       dsAttrTypeStandard:RealName dsAttrTypeStandard:NFSHomeDirectory
       dsAttrTypeStandard:UserShell

       A special value of IGNORE can be used for values that should be ignored
       in the import file on a record-by-record basis.

     --recordtype type
       Override the record type defined in the import file. For example, to
       import ComputerGroups as ComputerLists, use:

       --recordtype dsRecTypeStandard:ComputerLists

       The opposite works for importing ComputerLists as ComputerGroups, and so
       on.

     --remotehost hostname | ipaddress
       connects to a remote host at the network address specified.  Commonly
       used to import to a remote Mac OS X Server.

     --remoteusername value
       specifies user name to use for the remote connection.

     --remotepassword value
       specifies password to use for the remote connection. A secure prompt will
       be used to ask for the password if --remoteusername is specified and
       --remotepassword is not.  Using the prompt method is the most secure
       method of providing password to dsimport.

     --startid value
       indicates the ID number to start with when the import tool generates user
       or group IDs for any import file that lacks an ID as part of the import
       data.

     --template StandardUser | StandardGroup
       is used for delimited import of files that lack field descriptions.

       StandardUser contains the following fields in the order:
             1.   RecordName
             2.   Password
             3.   UniqueID
             4.   PrimaryGroupID
             5.   DistinguishedName
             6.   NFSHomeDirectory
             7.   UserShell

       StandardGroup contains the following fields in the order:
             1.   RecordName
             2.   Password
             3.   PrimaryGroupID
             4.   GroupMembership

     --username value
       is the admin username to use when importing records. If this is not
       specified the current user is the default name.  Also, if used in
       conjunction with --remotehost then this admin user will be used for the
       Open Directory node whereas the username provided in --remoteusername
       will be used for the remote connection.  If this option is left off but
       --remoteusername is provided, then the remote username will be used for
       both the connection and for importing records.

     --userpreset value
       designate a preset record to be applied to imported user records.

           dsimport myimportFile /Local/Default I --username administrator
           --password adminpassword
