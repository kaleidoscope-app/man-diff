       asked questions about Perl and Perl programming. It's divided by topic
       into nine major sections outlined in this document.

   Where to find the perlfaq

       <https://perldoc.perl.org/perlfaq>.  It is also included in the standard
       Perl distribution.

       with regular expressions, but those answers are found elsewhere in this
       document (in perlfaq9 : "How do I decode or create those %-encodings on
       the web" and perlfaq4 : "How do I determine whether a scalar is a
       number/whole/integer/float", to be precise).
