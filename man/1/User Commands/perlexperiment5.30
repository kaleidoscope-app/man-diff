NAME
       perlexperiment - A listing of experimental features in Perl

DESCRIPTION
       This document lists the current and past experimental features in the
       perl core. Although all of these are documented with their appropriate
       topics, this succinct listing gives you an overview and basic facts about
       their status.

       So far we've merely tried to find and list the experimental features and
       infer their inception, versions, etc. There's a lot of speculation here.

   Current experiments
       Smart match ("~~")
               Introduced in Perl 5.10.0

               Modified in Perl 5.10.1, 5.12.0

               Using this feature triggers warnings in the category
               "experimental::smartmatch".

               The ticket for this feature is [perl #119317]

   Accepted features
       These features were so wildly successful and played so well with others
       that we decided to remove their experimental status and admit them as
       full, stable features in the world of Perl, lavishing all the benefits
       and luxuries thereof.  They are also awarded +5 Stability and +3
       Charisma.
