NAME
       yapp - A perl frontend to the Parse::Yapp module

SYNOPSYS
       yapp [options] grammar[.yp]

       yapp -V

       yapp -h

DESCRIPTION
       yapp is a frontend to the Parse::Yapp module, which lets you compile
       Parse::Yapp grammar input files into Perl LALR(1) OO parser modules.

OPTIONS
       Options, as of today, are all optionals :-)

       -v  Creates a file grammar.output describing your parser. It will show
           you a summary of conflicts, rules, the DFA (Deterministic Finite
           Automaton) states and overall usage of the parser.

       -s  Create a standalone module in which the driver is included.  Note
           that if you have more than one parser module called from a program,
           to have it standalone, you need this option only for one of your
           parser module.

       -n  Disable source file line numbering embedded in your parser module.  I
           don't know why one should need it, but it's there.

       -m module
           Gives your parser module the package name (or name space or module
           name or class name or whatever-you-call-it) of module.  It defaults
           to grammar

       -o outfile
           The compiled output file will be named outfile for your parser
           module.  It defaults to grammar.pm or, if you specified the option -m
           A::Module::Name (see below), to Name.pm, in the current working
           directory.

       -t filename
           The -t filename option allows you to specify a file which should be
           used as template for generating the parser output.  The default is to
           use the internal template defined in Parse::Yapp::Output.pm.  For how
           to write your own template and which substitutions are available,
           have a look to the module Parse::Yapp::Output.pm : it should be
           obvious.

       -b shebang
           If you work on systems that understand so called shebangs, and your
           generated parser is directly an executable script, you can specifie
           one with the -b option, ie:

               yapp -b '/usr/local/bin/perl -w' -o myscript.pl myscript.yp

           This will output a file called myscript.pl whose very first line is:

               #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w

           The argument is mandatory, but if you specify an empty string, the
           value of $Config{perlpath} will be used instead.

       grammar
           The input grammar file. If no suffix is given, and the file does not
           exists, an attempt to open the file with a suffix of  .yp is tried
           before exiting.

       -V  Display current version of Parse::Yapp and gracefully exits.

       -h  Display the usage screen.

BUGS
       None known now :-)
