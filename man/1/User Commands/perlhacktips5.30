NAME
       perlhacktips - Tips for Perl core C code hacking

DESCRIPTION
       This document will help you learn the best way to go about hacking on the
       Perl core C code.  It covers common problems, debugging, profiling, and
       more.

       If you haven't read perlhack and perlhacktut yet, you might want to do
       that first.

COMMON PROBLEMS
       Perl source plays by ANSI C89 rules: no C99 (or C++) extensions.  You
       don't care about some particular platform having broken Perl? I hear
       there is still a strong demand for J2EE programmers.

   Perl environment problems
       •   Not compiling with threading

           Compiling with threading (-Duseithreads) completely rewrites the
           function prototypes of Perl.  You better try your changes with that.
           Related to this is the difference between "Perl_-less" and "Perl_-ly"
           APIs, for example:

             Perl_sv_setiv(aTHX_ ...);
             sv_setiv(...);

           The first one explicitly passes in the context, which is needed for
           e.g. threaded builds.  The second one does that implicitly; do not
           get them mixed.  If you are not passing in a aTHX_, you will need to
           do a dTHX (or a dVAR) as the first thing in the function.

           See "How multiple interpreters and concurrency are supported" in
           perlguts for further discussion about context.

       •   Not compiling with -DDEBUGGING

           The DEBUGGING define exposes more code to the compiler, therefore
           more ways for things to go wrong.  You should try it.

       •   Introducing (non-read-only) globals

           Do not introduce any modifiable globals, truly global or file static.
           They are bad form and complicate multithreading and other forms of
           concurrency.  The right way is to introduce them as new interpreter
           variables, see intrpvar.h (at the very end for binary compatibility).

           Introducing read-only (const) globals is okay, as long as you verify
           with e.g. "nm libperl.a|egrep -v ' [TURtr] '" (if your "nm" has BSD-
           style output) that the data you added really is read-only.  (If it
           is, it shouldn't show up in the output of that command.)

           If you want to have static strings, make them constant:

             static const char etc[] = "...";

           If you want to have arrays of constant strings, note carefully the
           right combination of "const"s:

               static const char * const yippee[] =
                   {"hi", "ho", "silver"};

           There is a way to completely hide any modifiable globals (they are
           all moved to heap), the compilation setting
           "-DPERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT_PRIVATE".  It is not normally used, but can be
           used for testing, read more about it in "Background and
           PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT" in perlguts.

       •   Not exporting your new function

           Some platforms (Win32, AIX, VMS, OS/2, to name a few) require any
           function that is part of the public API (the shared Perl library) to
           be explicitly marked as exported.  See the discussion about embed.pl
           in perlguts.

       •   Exporting your new function

           The new shiny result of either genuine new functionality or your
           arduous refactoring is now ready and correctly exported.  So what
           could possibly go wrong?

           Maybe simply that your function did not need to be exported in the
           first place.  Perl has a long and not so glorious history of
           exporting functions that it should not have.

           If the function is used only inside one source code file, make it
           static.  See the discussion about embed.pl in perlguts.

           If the function is used across several files, but intended only for
           Perl's internal use (and this should be the common case), do not
           export it to the public API.  See the discussion about embed.pl in
           perlguts.

   Portability problems
       The following are common causes of compilation and/or execution failures,
       not common to Perl as such.  The C FAQ is good bedtime reading.  Please
       test your changes with as many C compilers and platforms as possible; we
       will, anyway, and it's nice to save oneself from public embarrassment.

       If using gcc, you can add the "-std=c89" option which will hopefully
       catch most of these unportabilities.  (However it might also catch
       incompatibilities in your system's header files.)

       Use the Configure "-Dgccansipedantic" flag to enable the gcc "-ansi
       -pedantic" flags which enforce stricter ANSI rules.

       If using the "gcc -Wall" note that not all the possible warnings (like
       "-Wuninitialized") are given unless you also compile with "-O".

       Note that if using gcc, starting from Perl 5.9.5 the Perl core source
       code files (the ones at the top level of the source code distribution,
       but not e.g. the extensions under ext/) are automatically compiled with
       as many as possible of the "-std=c89", "-ansi", "-pedantic", and a
       selection of "-W" flags (see cflags.SH).

       Also study perlport carefully to avoid any bad assumptions about the
       operating system, filesystems, character set, and so forth.

       You may once in a while try a "make microperl" to see whether we can
       still compile Perl with just the bare minimum of interfaces.  (See
       README.micro.)

       Do not assume an operating system indicates a certain compiler.

       •   Casting pointers to integers or casting integers to pointers

               void castaway(U8* p)
               {
                 IV i = p;

           or

               void castaway(U8* p)
               {
                 IV i = (IV)p;

           Both are bad, and broken, and unportable.  Use the PTR2IV() macro
           that does it right.  (Likewise, there are PTR2UV(), PTR2NV(),
           INT2PTR(), and NUM2PTR().)

       •   Casting between function pointers and data pointers

           Technically speaking casting between function pointers and data
           pointers is unportable and undefined, but practically speaking it
           seems to work, but you should use the FPTR2DPTR() and DPTR2FPTR()
           macros.  Sometimes you can also play games with unions.

       •   Assuming sizeof(int) == sizeof(long)

           There are platforms where longs are 64 bits, and platforms where ints
           are 64 bits, and while we are out to shock you, even platforms where
           shorts are 64 bits.  This is all legal according to the C standard.
           (In other words, "long long" is not a portable way to specify 64
           bits, and "long long" is not even guaranteed to be any wider than
           "long".)

           Instead, use the definitions IV, UV, IVSIZE, I32SIZE, and so forth.
           Avoid things like I32 because they are not guaranteed to be exactly
           32 bits, they are at least 32 bits, nor are they guaranteed to be int
           or long.  If you really explicitly need 64-bit variables, use I64 and
           U64, but only if guarded by HAS_QUAD.

       •   Assuming one can dereference any type of pointer for any type of data

             char *p = ...;
             long pony = *(long *)p;    /* BAD */

           Many platforms, quite rightly so, will give you a core dump instead
           of a pony if the p happens not to be correctly aligned.

       •   Lvalue casts

             (int)*p = ...;    /* BAD */

           Simply not portable.  Get your lvalue to be of the right type, or
           maybe use temporary variables, or dirty tricks with unions.

       •   Assume anything about structs (especially the ones you don't control,
           like the ones coming from the system headers)

           •       That a certain field exists in a struct

           •       That no other fields exist besides the ones you know of

           •       That a field is of certain signedness, sizeof, or type

           •       That the fields are in a certain order

                   •       While C guarantees the ordering specified in the
                           struct definition, between different platforms the
                           definitions might differ

           •       That the sizeof(struct) or the alignments are the same
                   everywhere

                   •       There might be padding bytes between the fields to
                           align the fields - the bytes can be anything

                   •       Structs are required to be aligned to the maximum
                           alignment required by the fields - which for native
                           types is for usually equivalent to sizeof() of the
                           field

       •   Assuming the character set is ASCIIish

           Perl can compile and run under EBCDIC platforms.  See perlebcdic.
           This is transparent for the most part, but because the character sets
           differ, you shouldn't use numeric (decimal, octal, nor hex) constants
           to refer to characters.  You can safely say 'A', but not 0x41.  You
           can safely say '\n', but not "\012".  However, you can use macros
           defined in utf8.h to specify any code point portably.
           "LATIN1_TO_NATIVE(0xDF)" is going to be the code point that means
           LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S on whatever platform you are running on
           (on ASCII platforms it compiles without adding any extra code, so
           there is zero performance hit on those).  The acceptable inputs to
           "LATIN1_TO_NATIVE" are from 0x00 through 0xFF.  If your input isn't
           guaranteed to be in that range, use "UNICODE_TO_NATIVE" instead.
           "NATIVE_TO_LATIN1" and "NATIVE_TO_UNICODE" translate the opposite
           direction.

           If you need the string representation of a character that doesn't
           have a mnemonic name in C, you should add it to the list in
           regen/unicode_constants.pl, and have Perl create "#define"'s for you,
           based on the current platform.

           Note that the "isFOO" and "toFOO" macros in handy.h work properly on
           native code points and strings.

           Also, the range 'A' - 'Z' in ASCII is an unbroken sequence of 26
           upper case alphabetic characters.  That is not true in EBCDIC.  Nor
           for 'a' to 'z'.  But '0' - '9' is an unbroken range in both systems.
           Don't assume anything about other ranges.  (Note that special
           handling of ranges in regular expression patterns and
           transliterations makes it appear to Perl code that the aforementioned
           ranges are all unbroken.)

           Many of the comments in the existing code ignore the possibility of
           EBCDIC, and may be wrong therefore, even if the code works.  This is
           actually a tribute to the successful transparent insertion of being
           able to handle EBCDIC without having to change pre-existing code.

           UTF-8 and UTF-EBCDIC are two different encodings used to represent
           Unicode code points as sequences of bytes.  Macros  with the same
           names (but different definitions) in utf8.h and utfebcdic.h are used
           to allow the calling code to think that there is only one such
           encoding.  This is almost always referred to as "utf8", but it means
           the EBCDIC version as well.  Again, comments in the code may well be
           wrong even if the code itself is right.  For example, the concept of
           UTF-8 "invariant characters" differs between ASCII and EBCDIC.  On
           ASCII platforms, only characters that do not have the high-order bit
           set (i.e.  whose ordinals are strict ASCII, 0 - 127) are invariant,
           and the documentation and comments in the code may assume that, often
           referring to something like, say, "hibit".  The situation differs and
           is not so simple on EBCDIC machines, but as long as the code itself
           uses the "NATIVE_IS_INVARIANT()" macro appropriately, it works, even
           if the comments are wrong.

           As noted in "TESTING" in perlhack, when writing test scripts, the
           file t/charset_tools.pl contains some helpful functions for writing
           tests valid on both ASCII and EBCDIC platforms.  Sometimes, though, a
           test can't use a function and it's inconvenient to have different
           test versions depending on the platform.  There are 20 code points
           that are the same in all 4 character sets currently recognized by
           Perl (the 3 EBCDIC code pages plus ISO 8859-1 (ASCII/Latin1)).  These
           can be used in such tests, though there is a small possibility that
           Perl will become available in yet another character set, breaking
           your test.  All but one of these code points are C0 control
           characters.  The most significant controls that are the same are
           "\0", "\r", and "\N{VT}" (also specifiable as "\cK", "\x0B",
           "\N{U+0B}", or "\013").  The single non-control is U+00B6 PILCROW
           SIGN.  The controls that are the same have the same bit pattern in
           all 4 character sets, regardless of the UTF8ness of the string
           containing them.  The bit pattern for U+B6 is the same in all 4 for
           non-UTF8 strings, but differs in each when its containing string is
           UTF-8 encoded.  The only other code points that have some sort of
           sameness across all 4 character sets are the pair 0xDC and 0xFC.
           Together these represent upper- and lowercase LATIN LETTER U WITH
           DIAERESIS, but which is upper and which is lower may be reversed:
           0xDC is the capital in Latin1 and 0xFC is the small letter, while
           0xFC is the capital in EBCDIC and 0xDC is the small one.  This
           factoid may be exploited in writing case insensitive tests that are
           the same across all 4 character sets.

       •   Assuming the character set is just ASCII

           ASCII is a 7 bit encoding, but bytes have 8 bits in them.  The 128
           extra characters have different meanings depending on the locale.
           Absent a locale, currently these extra characters are generally
           considered to be unassigned, and this has presented some problems.
           This has being changed starting in 5.12 so that these characters can
           be considered to be Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1).

       •   Mixing #define and #ifdef

             #define BURGLE(x) ... \
             #ifdef BURGLE_OLD_STYLE        /* BAD */
             ... do it the old way ... \
             #else
             ... do it the new way ... \
             #endif

           You cannot portably "stack" cpp directives.  For example in the above
           you need two separate BURGLE() #defines, one for each #ifdef branch.

       •   Adding non-comment stuff after #endif or #else

             #ifdef SNOSH
             ...
             #else !SNOSH    /* BAD */
             ...
             #endif SNOSH    /* BAD */

           The #endif and #else cannot portably have anything non-comment after
           them.  If you want to document what is going (which is a good idea
           especially if the branches are long), use (C) comments:

             #ifdef SNOSH
             ...
             #else /* !SNOSH */
             ...
             #endif /* SNOSH */

           The gcc option "-Wendif-labels" warns about the bad variant (by
           default on starting from Perl 5.9.4).

       •   Having a comma after the last element of an enum list

             enum color {
               CERULEAN,
               CHARTREUSE,
               CINNABAR,     /* BAD */
             };

           is not portable.  Leave out the last comma.

           Also note that whether enums are implicitly morphable to ints varies
           between compilers, you might need to (int).

       •   Using //-comments

             // This function bamfoodles the zorklator.   /* BAD */

           That is C99 or C++.  Perl is C89.  Using the //-comments is silently
           allowed by many C compilers but cranking up the ANSI C89 strictness
           (which we like to do) causes the compilation to fail.

       •   Mixing declarations and code

             void zorklator()
             {
               int n = 3;
               set_zorkmids(n);    /* BAD */
               int q = 4;

           That is C99 or C++.  Some C compilers allow that, but you shouldn't.

           The gcc option "-Wdeclaration-after-statements" scans for such
           problems (by default on starting from Perl 5.9.4).

       •   Introducing variables inside for()

             for(int i = ...; ...; ...) {    /* BAD */

           That is C99 or C++.  While it would indeed be awfully nice to have
           that also in C89, to limit the scope of the loop variable, alas, we
           cannot.

       •   Mixing signed char pointers with unsigned char pointers

             int foo(char *s) { ... }
             ...
             unsigned char *t = ...; /* Or U8* t = ... */
             foo(t);   /* BAD */

           While this is legal practice, it is certainly dubious, and downright
           fatal in at least one platform: for example VMS cc considers this a
           fatal error.  One cause for people often making this mistake is that
           a "naked char" and therefore dereferencing a "naked char pointer"
           have an undefined signedness: it depends on the compiler and the
           flags of the compiler and the underlying platform whether the result
           is signed or unsigned.  For this very same reason using a 'char' as
           an array index is bad.

       •   Macros that have string constants and their arguments as substrings
           of the string constants

             #define FOO(n) printf("number = %d\n", n)    /* BAD */
             FOO(10);

           Pre-ANSI semantics for that was equivalent to

             printf("10umber = %d\10");

           which is probably not what you were expecting.  Unfortunately at
           least one reasonably common and modern C compiler does "real backward
           compatibility" here, in AIX that is what still happens even though
           the rest of the AIX compiler is very happily C89.

       •   Using printf formats for non-basic C types

              IV i = ...;
              printf("i = %d\n", i);    /* BAD */

           While this might by accident work in some platform (where IV happens
           to be an "int"), in general it cannot.  IV might be something larger.
           Even worse the situation is with more specific types (defined by
           Perl's configuration step in config.h):

              Uid_t who = ...;
              printf("who = %d\n", who);    /* BAD */

           The problem here is that Uid_t might be not only not "int"-wide but
           it might also be unsigned, in which case large uids would be printed
           as negative values.

           There is no simple solution to this because of printf()'s limited
           intelligence, but for many types the right format is available as
           with either 'f' or '_f' suffix, for example:

              IVdf /* IV in decimal */
              UVxf /* UV is hexadecimal */

              printf("i = %"IVdf"\n", i); /* The IVdf is a string constant. */

              Uid_t_f /* Uid_t in decimal */

              printf("who = %"Uid_t_f"\n", who);

           Or you can try casting to a "wide enough" type:

              printf("i = %"IVdf"\n", (IV)something_very_small_and_signed);

           See "Formatted Printing of Size_t and SSize_t" in perlguts for how to
           print those.

           Also remember that the %p format really does require a void pointer:

              U8* p = ...;
              printf("p = %p\n", (void*)p);

           The gcc option "-Wformat" scans for such problems.

       •   Blindly using variadic macros

           gcc has had them for a while with its own syntax, and C99 brought
           them with a standardized syntax.  Don't use the former, and use the
           latter only if the HAS_C99_VARIADIC_MACROS is defined.

       •   Blindly passing va_list

           Not all platforms support passing va_list to further varargs (stdarg)
           functions.  The right thing to do is to copy the va_list using the
           Perl_va_copy() if the NEED_VA_COPY is defined.

       •   Using gcc statement expressions

              val = ({...;...;...});    /* BAD */

           While a nice extension, it's not portable.  The Perl code does
           admittedly use them if available to gain some extra speed
           (essentially as a funky form of inlining), but you shouldn't.

       •   Binding together several statements in a macro

           Use the macros STMT_START and STMT_END.

              STMT_START {
                 ...
              } STMT_END

       •   Testing for operating systems or versions when should be testing for
           features

             #ifdef __FOONIX__    /* BAD */
             foo = quux();
             #endif

           Unless you know with 100% certainty that quux() is only ever
           available for the "Foonix" operating system and that is available and
           correctly working for all past, present, and future versions of
           "Foonix", the above is very wrong.  This is more correct (though
           still not perfect, because the below is a compile-time check):

             #ifdef HAS_QUUX
             foo = quux();
             #endif

           How does the HAS_QUUX become defined where it needs to be?  Well, if
           Foonix happens to be Unixy enough to be able to run the Configure
           script, and Configure has been taught about detecting and testing
           quux(), the HAS_QUUX will be correctly defined.  In other platforms,
           the corresponding configuration step will hopefully do the same.

           In a pinch, if you cannot wait for Configure to be educated, or if
           you have a good hunch of where quux() might be available, you can
           temporarily try the following:

             #if (defined(__FOONIX__) || defined(__BARNIX__))
             # define HAS_QUUX
             #endif

             ...

             #ifdef HAS_QUUX
             foo = quux();
             #endif

           But in any case, try to keep the features and operating systems
           separate.

           A good resource on the predefined macros for various operating
           systems, compilers, and so forth is
           <http://sourceforge.net/p/predef/wiki/Home/>

       •   Assuming the contents of static memory pointed to by the return
           values of Perl wrappers for C library functions doesn't change.  Many
           C library functions return pointers to static storage that can be
           overwritten by subsequent calls to the same or related functions.
           Perl has light-weight wrappers for some of these functions, and which
           don't make copies of the static memory.  A good example is the
           interface to the environment variables that are in effect for the
           program.  Perl has "PerlEnv_getenv" to get values from the
           environment.  But the return is a pointer to static memory in the C
           library.  If you are using the value to immediately test for
           something, that's fine, but if you save the value and expect it to be
           unchanged by later processing, you would be wrong, but perhaps you
           wouldn't know it because different C library implementations behave
           differently, and the one on the platform you're testing on might work
           for your situation.  But on some platforms, a subsequent call to
           "PerlEnv_getenv" or related function WILL overwrite the memory that
           your first call points to.  This has led to some hard-to-debug
           problems.  Do a "savepv" in perlapi to make a copy, thus avoiding
           these problems.  You will have to free the copy when you're done to
           avoid memory leaks.  If you don't have control over when it gets
           freed, you'll need to make the copy in a mortal scalar, like so:

            if ((s = PerlEnv_getenv("foo") == NULL) {
               ... /* handle NULL case */
            }
            else {
                s = SvPVX(sv_2mortal(newSVpv(s, 0)));
            }

           The above example works only if "s" is "NUL"-terminated; otherwise
           you have to pass its length to "newSVpv".

   Problematic System Interfaces
       •   malloc(0), realloc(0), calloc(0, 0) are non-portable.  To be portable
           allocate at least one byte.  (In general you should rarely need to
           work at this low level, but instead use the various malloc wrappers.)

       •   snprintf() - the return type is unportable.  Use my_snprintf()
           instead.

   Security problems
       Last but not least, here are various tips for safer coding.  See also
       perlclib for libc/stdio replacements one should use.

       •   Do not use gets()

           Or we will publicly ridicule you.  Seriously.

       •   Do not use tmpfile()

           Use mkstemp() instead.

       •   Do not use strcpy() or strcat() or strncpy() or strncat()

           Use my_strlcpy() and my_strlcat() instead: they either use the native
           implementation, or Perl's own implementation (borrowed from the
           public domain implementation of INN).

       •   Do not use sprintf() or vsprintf()

           If you really want just plain byte strings, use my_snprintf() and
           my_vsnprintf() instead, which will try to use snprintf() and
           vsnprintf() if those safer APIs are available.  If you want something
           fancier than a plain byte string, use "Perl_form"() or SVs and
           "Perl_sv_catpvf()".

           Note that glibc "printf()", "sprintf()", etc. are buggy before glibc
           version 2.17.  They won't allow a "%.s" format with a precision to
           create a string that isn't valid UTF-8 if the current underlying
           locale of the program is UTF-8.  What happens is that the %s and its
           operand are simply skipped without any notice.
           <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6530>.

       •   Do not use atoi()

           Use grok_atoUV() instead.  atoi() has ill-defined behavior on
           overflows, and cannot be used for incremental parsing.  It is also
           affected by locale, which is bad.

       •   Do not use strtol() or strtoul()

           Use grok_atoUV() instead.  strtol() or strtoul() (or their
           IV/UV-friendly macro disguises, Strtol() and Strtoul(), or Atol() and
           Atoul() are affected by locale, which is bad.

DEBUGGING
       You can compile a special debugging version of Perl, which allows you to
       use the "-D" option of Perl to tell more about what Perl is doing.  But
       sometimes there is no alternative than to dive in with a debugger, either
       to see the stack trace of a core dump (very useful in a bug report), or
       trying to figure out what went wrong before the core dump happened, or
       how did we end up having wrong or unexpected results.

   Poking at Perl
       To really poke around with Perl, you'll probably want to build Perl for
       debugging, like this:

           ./Configure -d -DDEBUGGING
           make

       "-DDEBUGGING" turns on the C compiler's "-g" flag to have it produce
       debugging information which will allow us to step through a running
       program, and to see in which C function we are at (without the debugging
       information we might see only the numerical addresses of the functions,
       which is not very helpful). It will also turn on the "DEBUGGING"
       compilation symbol which enables all the internal debugging code in Perl.
       There are a whole bunch of things you can debug with this: perlrun lists
       them all, and the best way to find out about them is to play about with
       them.  The most useful options are probably

           l  Context (loop) stack processing
           s  Stack snapshots (with v, displays all stacks)
           t  Trace execution
           o  Method and overloading resolution
           c  String/numeric conversions

       For example

           $ perl -Dst -e '$a + 1'
           ....
           (-e:1)      gvsv(main::a)
               =>  UNDEF
           (-e:1)      const(IV(1))
               =>  UNDEF  IV(1)
           (-e:1)      add
               =>  NV(1)

       Some of the functionality of the debugging code can be achieved with a
       non-debugging perl by using XS modules:

           -Dr => use re 'debug'
           -Dx => use O 'Debug'

   Using a source-level debugger
       If the debugging output of "-D" doesn't help you, it's time to step
       through perl's execution with a source-level debugger.

       •  We'll use "gdb" for our examples here; the principles will apply to
          any debugger (many vendors call their debugger "dbx"), but check the
          manual of the one you're using.

       To fire up the debugger, type

           gdb ./perl

       Or if you have a core dump:

           gdb ./perl core

       You'll want to do that in your Perl source tree so the debugger can read
       the source code.  You should see the copyright message, followed by the
       prompt.

           (gdb)

       "help" will get you into the documentation, but here are the most useful
       commands:

       •  run [args]

          Run the program with the given arguments.

       •  break function_name

       •  break source.c:xxx

          Tells the debugger that we'll want to pause execution when we reach
          either the named function (but see "Internal Functions" in perlguts!)
          or the given line in the named source file.

       •  step

          Steps through the program a line at a time.

       •  next

          Steps through the program a line at a time, without descending into
          functions.

       •  continue

          Run until the next breakpoint.

       •  finish

          Run until the end of the current function, then stop again.

       •  'enter'

          Just pressing Enter will do the most recent operation again - it's a
          blessing when stepping through miles of source code.

       •  ptype

          Prints the C definition of the argument given.

            (gdb) ptype PL_op
            type = struct op {
                OP *op_next;
                OP *op_sibparent;
                OP *(*op_ppaddr)(void);
                PADOFFSET op_targ;
                unsigned int op_type : 9;
                unsigned int op_opt : 1;
                unsigned int op_slabbed : 1;
                unsigned int op_savefree : 1;
                unsigned int op_static : 1;
                unsigned int op_folded : 1;
                unsigned int op_spare : 2;
                U8 op_flags;
                U8 op_private;
            } *

       •  print

          Execute the given C code and print its results.  WARNING: Perl makes
          heavy use of macros, and gdb does not necessarily support macros (see
          later "gdb macro support").  You'll have to substitute them yourself,
          or to invoke cpp on the source code files (see "The .i Targets") So,
          for instance, you can't say

              print SvPV_nolen(sv)

          but you have to say

              print Perl_sv_2pv_nolen(sv)

       You may find it helpful to have a "macro dictionary", which you can
       produce by saying "cpp -dM perl.c | sort".  Even then, cpp won't
       recursively apply those macros for you.

   gdb macro support
       Recent versions of gdb have fairly good macro support, but in order to
       use it you'll need to compile perl with macro definitions included in the
       debugging information.  Using gcc version 3.1, this means configuring
       with "-Doptimize=-g3".  Other compilers might use a different switch (if
       they support debugging macros at all).

   Dumping Perl Data Structures
       One way to get around this macro hell is to use the dumping functions in
       dump.c; these work a little like an internal Devel::Peek, but they also
       cover OPs and other structures that you can't get at from Perl.  Let's
       take an example.  We'll use the "$a = $b + $c" we used before, but give
       it a bit of context: "$b = "6XXXX"; $c = 2.3;".  Where's a good place to
       stop and poke around?

       What about "pp_add", the function we examined earlier to implement the
       "+" operator:

           (gdb) break Perl_pp_add
           Breakpoint 1 at 0x46249f: file pp_hot.c, line 309.

       Notice we use "Perl_pp_add" and not "pp_add" - see "Internal Functions"
       in perlguts.  With the breakpoint in place, we can run our program:

           (gdb) run -e '$b = "6XXXX"; $c = 2.3; $a = $b + $c'

       Lots of junk will go past as gdb reads in the relevant source files and
       libraries, and then:

           Breakpoint 1, Perl_pp_add () at pp_hot.c:309
           1396    dSP; dATARGET; bool useleft; SV *svl, *svr;
           (gdb) step
           311           dPOPTOPnnrl_ul;
           (gdb)

       We looked at this bit of code before, and we said that "dPOPTOPnnrl_ul"
       arranges for two "NV"s to be placed into "left" and "right" - let's
       slightly expand it:

        #define dPOPTOPnnrl_ul  NV right = POPn; \
                                SV *leftsv = TOPs; \
                                NV left = USE_LEFT(leftsv) ? SvNV(leftsv) : 0.0

       "POPn" takes the SV from the top of the stack and obtains its NV either
       directly (if "SvNOK" is set) or by calling the "sv_2nv" function.  "TOPs"
       takes the next SV from the top of the stack - yes, "POPn" uses "TOPs" -
       but doesn't remove it.  We then use "SvNV" to get the NV from "leftsv" in
       the same way as before - yes, "POPn" uses "SvNV".

       Since we don't have an NV for $b, we'll have to use "sv_2nv" to convert
       it.  If we step again, we'll find ourselves there:

           (gdb) step
           Perl_sv_2nv (sv=0xa0675d0) at sv.c:1669
           1669        if (!sv)
           (gdb)

       We can now use "Perl_sv_dump" to investigate the SV:

           (gdb) print Perl_sv_dump(sv)
           SV = PV(0xa057cc0) at 0xa0675d0
           REFCNT = 1
           FLAGS = (POK,pPOK)
           PV = 0xa06a510 "6XXXX"\0
           CUR = 5
           LEN = 6
           $1 = void

       We know we're going to get 6 from this, so let's finish the subroutine:

           (gdb) finish
           Run till exit from #0  Perl_sv_2nv (sv=0xa0675d0) at sv.c:1671
           0x462669 in Perl_pp_add () at pp_hot.c:311
           311           dPOPTOPnnrl_ul;

       We can also dump out this op: the current op is always stored in "PL_op",
       and we can dump it with "Perl_op_dump".  This'll give us similar output
       to CPAN module B::Debug.

           (gdb) print Perl_op_dump(PL_op)
           {
           13  TYPE = add  ===> 14
               TARG = 1
               FLAGS = (SCALAR,KIDS)
               {
                   TYPE = null  ===> (12)
                     (was rv2sv)
                   FLAGS = (SCALAR,KIDS)
                   {
           11          TYPE = gvsv  ===> 12
                       FLAGS = (SCALAR)
                       GV = main::b
                   }
               }

       # finish this later #

   Using gdb to look at specific parts of a program
       With the example above, you knew to look for "Perl_pp_add", but what if
       there were multiple calls to it all over the place, or you didn't know
       what the op was you were looking for?

       One way to do this is to inject a rare call somewhere near what you're
       looking for.  For example, you could add "study" before your method:

           study;

       And in gdb do:

           (gdb) break Perl_pp_study

       And then step until you hit what you're looking for.  This works well in
       a loop if you want to only break at certain iterations:

           for my $c (1..100) {
               study if $c == 50;
           }

   Using gdb to look at what the parser/lexer are doing
       If you want to see what perl is doing when parsing/lexing your code, you
       can use "BEGIN {}":

           print "Before\n";
           BEGIN { study; }
           print "After\n";

       And in gdb:

           (gdb) break Perl_pp_study

       If you want to see what the parser/lexer is doing inside of "if" blocks
       and the like you need to be a little trickier:

           if ($a && $b && do { BEGIN { study } 1 } && $c) { ... }

SOURCE CODE STATIC ANALYSIS
       Various tools exist for analysing C source code statically, as opposed to
       dynamically, that is, without executing the code.  It is possible to
       detect resource leaks, undefined behaviour, type mismatches, portability
       problems, code paths that would cause illegal memory accesses, and other
       similar problems by just parsing the C code and looking at the resulting
       graph, what does it tell about the execution and data flows.  As a matter
       of fact, this is exactly how C compilers know to give warnings about
       dubious code.

   lint
       The good old C code quality inspector, "lint", is available in several
       platforms, but please be aware that there are several different
       implementations of it by different vendors, which means that the flags
       are not identical across different platforms.

       There is a "lint" target in Makefile, but you may have to diddle with the
       flags (see above).

   Coverity
       Coverity (<http://www.coverity.com/>) is a product similar to lint and as
       a testbed for their product they periodically check several open source
       projects, and they give out accounts to open source developers to the
       defect databases.

       There is Coverity setup for the perl5 project:
       <https://scan.coverity.com/projects/perl5>

   HP-UX cadvise (Code Advisor)
       HP has a C/C++ static analyzer product for HP-UX caller Code Advisor.
       (Link not given here because the URL is horribly long and seems horribly
       unstable; use the search engine of your choice to find it.)  The use of
       the "cadvise_cc" recipe with "Configure ... -Dcc=./cadvise_cc" (see
       cadvise "User Guide") is recommended; as is the use of "+wall".

   cpd (cut-and-paste detector)
       The cpd tool detects cut-and-paste coding.  If one instance of the cut-
       and-pasted code changes, all the other spots should probably be changed,
       too.  Therefore such code should probably be turned into a subroutine or
       a macro.

       cpd (<http://pmd.sourceforge.net/cpd.html>) is part of the pmd project
       (<http://pmd.sourceforge.net/>).  pmd was originally written for static
       analysis of Java code, but later the cpd part of it was extended to parse
       also C and C++.

       Download the pmd-bin-X.Y.zip () from the SourceForge site, extract the
       pmd-X.Y.jar from it, and then run that on source code thusly:

         java -cp pmd-X.Y.jar net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.CPD \
          --minimum-tokens 100 --files /some/where/src --language c > cpd.txt

       You may run into memory limits, in which case you should use the -Xmx
       option:

         java -Xmx512M ...

   gcc warnings
       Though much can be written about the inconsistency and coverage problems
       of gcc warnings (like "-Wall" not meaning "all the warnings", or some
       common portability problems not being covered by "-Wall", or "-ansi" and
       "-pedantic" both being a poorly defined collection of warnings, and so
       forth), gcc is still a useful tool in keeping our coding nose clean.

       The "-Wall" is by default on.

       The "-ansi" (and its sidekick, "-pedantic") would be nice to be on
       always, but unfortunately they are not safe on all platforms, they can
       for example cause fatal conflicts with the system headers (Solaris being
       a prime example).  If Configure "-Dgccansipedantic" is used, the "cflags"
       frontend selects "-ansi -pedantic" for the platforms where they are known
       to be safe.

       The following extra flags are added:

       •   "-Wendif-labels"

       •   "-Wextra"

       •   "-Wc++-compat"

       •   "-Wwrite-strings"

       •   "-Werror=declaration-after-statement"

       •   "-Werror=pointer-arith"

       The following flags would be nice to have but they would first need their
       own Augean stablemaster:

       •   "-Wshadow"

       •   "-Wstrict-prototypes"

       The "-Wtraditional" is another example of the annoying tendency of gcc to
       bundle a lot of warnings under one switch (it would be impossible to
       deploy in practice because it would complain a lot) but it does contain
       some warnings that would be beneficial to have available on their own,
       such as the warning about string constants inside macros containing the
       macro arguments: this behaved differently pre-ANSI than it does in ANSI,
       and some C compilers are still in transition, AIX being an example.

   Warnings of other C compilers
       Other C compilers (yes, there are other C compilers than gcc) often have
       their "strict ANSI" or "strict ANSI with some portability extensions"
       modes on, like for example the Sun Workshop has its "-Xa" mode on (though
       implicitly), or the DEC (these days, HP...) has its "-std1" mode on.

MEMORY DEBUGGERS
       NOTE 1: Running under older memory debuggers such as Purify, valgrind or
       Third Degree greatly slows down the execution: seconds become minutes,
       minutes become hours.  For example as of Perl 5.8.1, the
       ext/Encode/t/Unicode.t takes extraordinarily long to complete under e.g.
       Purify, Third Degree, and valgrind.  Under valgrind it takes more than
       six hours, even on a snappy computer.  The said test must be doing
       something that is quite unfriendly for memory debuggers.  If you don't
       feel like waiting, that you can simply kill away the perl process.
       Roughly valgrind slows down execution by factor 10, AddressSanitizer by
       factor 2.

       NOTE 2: To minimize the number of memory leak false alarms (see
       "PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL" for more information), you have to set the
       environment variable PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL to 2.  For example, like this:

           env PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2 valgrind ./perl -Ilib ...

       NOTE 3: There are known memory leaks when there are compile-time errors
       within eval or require, seeing "S_doeval" in the call stack is a good
       sign of these.  Fixing these leaks is non-trivial, unfortunately, but
       they must be fixed eventually.

       NOTE 4: DynaLoader will not clean up after itself completely unless Perl
       is built with the Configure option "-Accflags=-DDL_UNLOAD_ALL_AT_EXIT".

   valgrind
       The valgrind tool can be used to find out both memory leaks and illegal
       heap memory accesses.  As of version 3.3.0, Valgrind only supports Linux
       on x86, x86-64 and PowerPC and Darwin (OS X) on x86 and x86-64.  The
       special "test.valgrind" target can be used to run the tests under
       valgrind.  Found errors and memory leaks are logged in files named
       testfile.valgrind and by default output is displayed inline.

       Example usage:

           make test.valgrind

       Since valgrind adds significant overhead, tests will take much longer to
       run.  The valgrind tests support being run in parallel to help with this:

           TEST_JOBS=9 make test.valgrind

       Note that the above two invocations will be very verbose as reachable
       memory and leak-checking is enabled by default.  If you want to just see
       pure errors, try:

           VG_OPTS='-q --leak-check=no --show-reachable=no' TEST_JOBS=9 \
               make test.valgrind

       Valgrind also provides a cachegrind tool, invoked on perl as:

           VG_OPTS=--tool=cachegrind make test.valgrind

       As system libraries (most notably glibc) are also triggering errors,
       valgrind allows to suppress such errors using suppression files.  The
       default suppression file that comes with valgrind already catches a lot
       of them.  Some additional suppressions are defined in t/perl.supp.

       To get valgrind and for more information see

           http://valgrind.org/

   AddressSanitizer
       AddressSanitizer is a clang and gcc extension, included in clang since
       v3.1 and gcc since v4.8.  It checks illegal heap pointers, global
       pointers, stack pointers and use after free errors, and is fast enough
       that you can easily compile your debugging or optimized perl with it.  It
       does not check memory leaks though.  AddressSanitizer is available for
       Linux, Mac OS X and soon on Windows.

       To build perl with AddressSanitizer, your Configure invocation should
       look like:

           sh Configure -des -Dcc=clang \
              -Accflags=-faddress-sanitizer -Aldflags=-faddress-sanitizer \
              -Alddlflags=-shared\ -faddress-sanitizer

       where these arguments mean:

       •   -Dcc=clang

           This should be replaced by the full path to your clang executable if
           it is not in your path.

       •   -Accflags=-faddress-sanitizer

           Compile perl and extensions sources with AddressSanitizer.

       •   -Aldflags=-faddress-sanitizer

           Link the perl executable with AddressSanitizer.

       •   -Alddlflags=-shared\ -faddress-sanitizer

           Link dynamic extensions with AddressSanitizer.  You must manually
           specify "-shared" because using "-Alddlflags=-shared" will prevent
           Configure from setting a default value for "lddlflags", which usually
           contains "-shared" (at least on Linux).

       See also
       <http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer>.

PROFILING
       Depending on your platform there are various ways of profiling Perl.

       There are two commonly used techniques of profiling executables:
       statistical time-sampling and basic-block counting.

       The first method takes periodically samples of the CPU program counter,
       and since the program counter can be correlated with the code generated
       for functions, we get a statistical view of in which functions the
       program is spending its time.  The caveats are that very small/fast
       functions have lower probability of showing up in the profile, and that
       periodically interrupting the program (this is usually done rather
       frequently, in the scale of milliseconds) imposes an additional overhead
       that may skew the results.  The first problem can be alleviated by
       running the code for longer (in general this is a good idea for
       profiling), the second problem is usually kept in guard by the profiling
       tools themselves.

       The second method divides up the generated code into basic blocks.  Basic
       blocks are sections of code that are entered only in the beginning and
       exited only at the end.  For example, a conditional jump starts a basic
       block.  Basic block profiling usually works by instrumenting the code by
       adding enter basic block #nnnn book-keeping code to the generated code.
       During the execution of the code the basic block counters are then
       updated appropriately.  The caveat is that the added extra code can skew
       the results: again, the profiling tools usually try to factor their own
       effects out of the results.

   Gprof Profiling
       gprof is a profiling tool available in many Unix platforms which uses
       statistical time-sampling.  You can build a profiled version of perl by
       compiling using gcc with the flag "-pg".  Either edit config.sh or re-run
       Configure.  Running the profiled version of Perl will create an output
       file called gmon.out which contains the profiling data collected during
       the execution.

       quick hint:

           $ sh Configure -des -Dusedevel -Accflags='-pg' \
               -Aldflags='-pg' -Alddlflags='-pg -shared' \
               && make perl
           $ ./perl ... # creates gmon.out in current directory
           $ gprof ./perl > out
           $ less out

       (you probably need to add "-shared" to the <-Alddlflags> line until RT
       #118199 is resolved)

       The gprof tool can then display the collected data in various ways.
       Usually gprof understands the following options:

       •   -a

           Suppress statically defined functions from the profile.

       •   -b

           Suppress the verbose descriptions in the profile.

       •   -e routine

           Exclude the given routine and its descendants from the profile.

       •   -f routine

           Display only the given routine and its descendants in the profile.

       •   -s

           Generate a summary file called gmon.sum which then may be given to
           subsequent gprof runs to accumulate data over several runs.

       •   -z

           Display routines that have zero usage.

       For more detailed explanation of the available commands and output
       formats, see your own local documentation of gprof.

   GCC gcov Profiling
       basic block profiling is officially available in gcc 3.0 and later.  You
       can build a profiled version of perl by compiling using gcc with the
       flags "-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage".  Either edit config.sh or re-run
       Configure.

       quick hint:

           $ sh Configure -des -Dusedevel -Doptimize='-g' \
               -Accflags='-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage' \
               -Aldflags='-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage' \
               -Alddlflags='-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage -shared' \
               && make perl
           $ rm -f regexec.c.gcov regexec.gcda
           $ ./perl ...
           $ gcov regexec.c
           $ less regexec.c.gcov

       (you probably need to add "-shared" to the <-Alddlflags> line until RT
       #118199 is resolved)

       Running the profiled version of Perl will cause profile output to be
       generated.  For each source file an accompanying .gcda file will be
       created.

       To display the results you use the gcov utility (which should be
       installed if you have gcc 3.0 or newer installed).  gcov is run on source
       code files, like this

           gcov sv.c

       which will cause sv.c.gcov to be created.  The .gcov files contain the
       source code annotated with relative frequencies of execution indicated by
       "#" markers.  If you want to generate .gcov files for all profiled object
       files, you can run something like this:

           for file in `find . -name \*.gcno`
           do sh -c "cd `dirname $file` && gcov `basename $file .gcno`"
           done

       Useful options of gcov include "-b" which will summarise the basic block,
       branch, and function call coverage, and "-c" which instead of relative
       frequencies will use the actual counts.  For more information on the use
       of gcov and basic block profiling with gcc, see the latest GNU CC manual.
       As of gcc 4.8, this is at
       <http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov-Intro.html#Gcov-Intro>

MISCELLANEOUS TRICKS
   PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL
       If you want to run any of the tests yourself manually using e.g.
       valgrind, please note that by default perl does not explicitly cleanup
       all the memory it has allocated (such as global memory arenas) but
       instead lets the exit() of the whole program "take care" of such
       allocations, also known as "global destruction of objects".

       There is a way to tell perl to do complete cleanup: set the environment
       variable PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL to a non-zero value.  The t/TEST wrapper
       does set this to 2, and this is what you need to do too, if you don't
       want to see the "global leaks": For example, for running under valgrind

           env PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2 valgrind ./perl -Ilib t/foo/bar.t

       (Note: the mod_perl apache module uses also this environment variable for
       its own purposes and extended its semantics.  Refer to the mod_perl
       documentation for more information.  Also, spawned threads do the
       equivalent of setting this variable to the value 1.)

       If, at the end of a run you get the message N scalars leaked, you can
       recompile with "-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS", ("Configure
       -Accflags=-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS"), which will cause the addresses of
       all those leaked SVs to be dumped along with details as to where each SV
       was originally allocated.  This information is also displayed by
       Devel::Peek.  Note that the extra details recorded with each SV increases
       memory usage, so it shouldn't be used in production environments.  It
       also converts "new_SV()" from a macro into a real function, so you can
       use your favourite debugger to discover where those pesky SVs were
       allocated.

       If you see that you're leaking memory at runtime, but neither valgrind
       nor "-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS" will find anything, you're probably leaking
       SVs that are still reachable and will be properly cleaned up during
       destruction of the interpreter.  In such cases, using the "-Dm" switch
       can point you to the source of the leak.  If the executable was built
       with "-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS", "-Dm" will output SV allocations in
       addition to memory allocations.  Each SV allocation has a distinct serial
       number that will be written on creation and destruction of the SV.  So if
       you're executing the leaking code in a loop, you need to look for SVs
       that are created, but never destroyed between each cycle.  If such an SV
       is found, set a conditional breakpoint within "new_SV()" and make it
       break only when "PL_sv_serial" is equal to the serial number of the
       leaking SV.  Then you will catch the interpreter in exactly the state
       where the leaking SV is allocated, which is sufficient in many cases to
       find the source of the leak.

       As "-Dm" is using the PerlIO layer for output, it will by itself allocate
       quite a bunch of SVs, which are hidden to avoid recursion.  You can
       bypass the PerlIO layer if you use the SV logging provided by
       "-DPERL_MEM_LOG" instead.

   PERL_MEM_LOG
       If compiled with "-DPERL_MEM_LOG" ("-Accflags=-DPERL_MEM_LOG"), both
       memory and SV allocations go through logging functions, which is handy
       for breakpoint setting.

       Unless "-DPERL_MEM_LOG_NOIMPL" ("-Accflags=-DPERL_MEM_LOG_NOIMPL") is
       also compiled, the logging functions read $ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} to determine
       whether to log the event, and if so how:

           $ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /m/           Log all memory ops
           $ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /s/           Log all SV ops
           $ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /t/           include timestamp in Log
           $ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /^(\d+)/      write to FD given (default is 2)

       Memory logging is somewhat similar to "-Dm" but is independent of
       "-DDEBUGGING", and at a higher level; all uses of Newx(), Renew(), and
       Safefree() are logged with the caller's source code file and line number
       (and C function name, if supported by the C compiler).  In contrast,
       "-Dm" is directly at the point of "malloc()".  SV logging is similar.

       Since the logging doesn't use PerlIO, all SV allocations are logged and
       no extra SV allocations are introduced by enabling the logging.  If
       compiled with "-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS", the serial number for each SV
       allocation is also logged.

   DDD over gdb
       Those debugging perl with the DDD frontend over gdb may find the
       following useful:

       You can extend the data conversion shortcuts menu, so for example you can
       display an SV's IV value with one click, without doing any typing.  To do
       that simply edit ~/.ddd/init file and add after:

         ! Display shortcuts.
         Ddd*gdbDisplayShortcuts: \
         /t ()   // Convert to Bin\n\
         /d ()   // Convert to Dec\n\
         /x ()   // Convert to Hex\n\
         /o ()   // Convert to Oct(\n\

       the following two lines:

         ((XPV*) (())->sv_any )->xpv_pv  // 2pvx\n\
         ((XPVIV*) (())->sv_any )->xiv_iv // 2ivx

       so now you can do ivx and pvx lookups or you can plug there the sv_peek
       "conversion":

         Perl_sv_peek(my_perl, (SV*)()) // sv_peek

       (The my_perl is for threaded builds.)  Just remember that every line, but
       the last one, should end with \n\

       Alternatively edit the init file interactively via: 3rd mouse button ->
       New Display -> Edit Menu

       Note: you can define up to 20 conversion shortcuts in the gdb section.

   C backtrace
       On some platforms Perl supports retrieving the C level backtrace (similar
       to what symbolic debuggers like gdb do).

       The backtrace returns the stack trace of the C call frames, with the
       symbol names (function names), the object names (like "perl"), and if it
       can, also the source code locations (file:line).

       The supported platforms are Linux, and OS X (some *BSD might work at
       least partly, but they have not yet been tested).

       This feature hasn't been tested with multiple threads, but it will only
       show the backtrace of the thread doing the backtracing.

       The feature needs to be enabled with "Configure -Dusecbacktrace".

       The "-Dusecbacktrace" also enables keeping the debug information when
       compiling/linking (often: "-g").  Many compilers/linkers do support
       having both optimization and keeping the debug information.  The debug
       information is needed for the symbol names and the source locations.

       Static functions might not be visible for the backtrace.

       Source code locations, even if available, can often be missing or
       misleading if the compiler has e.g. inlined code.  Optimizer can make
       matching the source code and the object code quite challenging.

       Linux
           You must have the BFD (-lbfd) library installed, otherwise "perl"
           will fail to link.  The BFD is usually distributed as part of the GNU
           binutils.

           Summary: "Configure ... -Dusecbacktrace" and you need "-lbfd".

       OS X
           The source code locations are supported only if you have the
           Developer Tools installed.  (BFD is not needed.)

           Summary: "Configure ... -Dusecbacktrace" and installing the Developer
           Tools would be good.

       Optionally, for trying out the feature, you may want to enable automatic
       dumping of the backtrace just before a warning or croak (die) message is
       emitted, by adding "-Accflags=-DUSE_C_BACKTRACE_ON_ERROR" for Configure.

       Unless the above additional feature is enabled, nothing about the
       backtrace functionality is visible, except for the Perl/XS level.

       Furthermore, even if you have enabled this feature to be compiled, you
       need to enable it in runtime with an environment variable:
       "PERL_C_BACKTRACE_ON_ERROR=10".  It must be an integer higher than zero,
       telling the desired frame count.

       Retrieving the backtrace from Perl level (using for example an XS
       extension) would be much less exciting than one would hope: normally you
       would see "runops", "entersub", and not much else.  This API is intended
       to be called from within the Perl implementation, not from Perl level
       execution.

       The C API for the backtrace is as follows:

       get_c_backtrace
       free_c_backtrace
       get_c_backtrace_dump
       dump_c_backtrace

   Poison
       If you see in a debugger a memory area mysteriously full of 0xABABABAB or
       0xEFEFEFEF, you may be seeing the effect of the Poison() macros, see
       perlclib.

   Read-only optrees
       Under ithreads the optree is read only.  If you want to enforce this, to
       check for write accesses from buggy code, compile with
       "-Accflags=-DPERL_DEBUG_READONLY_OPS" to enable code that allocates op
       memory via "mmap", and sets it read-only when it is attached to a
       subroutine.  Any write access to an op results in a "SIGBUS" and abort.

       This code is intended for development only, and may not be portable even
       to all Unix variants.  Also, it is an 80% solution, in that it isn't able
       to make all ops read only.  Specifically it does not apply to op slabs
       belonging to "BEGIN" blocks.

       However, as an 80% solution it is still effective, as it has caught bugs
       in the past.

   When is a bool not a bool?
       On pre-C99 compilers, "bool" is defined as equivalent to "char".
       Consequently assignment of any larger type to a "bool" is unsafe and may
       be truncated.  The "cBOOL" macro exists to cast it correctly; you may
       also find that using it is shorter and clearer than writing out the
       equivalent conditional expression longhand.

       On those platforms and compilers where "bool" really is a boolean (C++,
       C99), it is easy to forget the cast.  You can force "bool" to be a "char"
       by compiling with "-Accflags=-DPERL_BOOL_AS_CHAR".  You may also wish to
       run "Configure" with something like

           -Accflags='-Wconversion -Wno-sign-conversion -Wno-shorten-64-to-32'

       or your compiler's equivalent to make it easier to spot any unsafe
       truncations that show up.

       The "TRUE" and "FALSE" macros are available for situations where using
       them would clarify intent. (But they always just mean the same as the
       integers 1 and 0 regardless, so using them isn't compulsory.)

   The .i Targets
       You can expand the macros in a foo.c file by saying

           make foo.i

       which will expand the macros using cpp.  Don't be scared by the results.
