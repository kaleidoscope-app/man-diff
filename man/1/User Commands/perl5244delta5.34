Security
   [CVE-2018-6797] heap-buffer-overflow (WRITE of size 1) in S_regatom
       (regcomp.c)
       A crafted regular expression could cause a heap buffer write overflow,
       with control over the bytes written.  [GH #16185]
       <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16185>

   [CVE-2018-6798] Heap-buffer-overflow in Perl__byte_dump_string (utf8.c)
       Matching a crafted locale dependent regular expression could cause a heap
       buffer read overflow and potentially information disclosure.  [GH #16143]
       <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16143>

   [CVE-2018-6913] heap-buffer-overflow in S_pack_rec
       "pack()" could cause a heap buffer write overflow with a large item
       count.  [GH #16098] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16098>

   Assertion failure in Perl__core_swash_init (utf8.c)
       Control characters in a supposed Unicode property name could cause perl
       to crash.  This has been fixed.  [perl #132055]
       <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=132055> [perl #132553]
       <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=132553> [perl #132658]
       <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=132658>

Incompatible Changes
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.24.3.  If any
       exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report.  See
       "Reporting Bugs" below.

Modules and Pragmata
   Updated Modules and Pragmata
       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 5.20170922_24 to
           5.20180414_24.

Selected Bug Fixes
       •   The "readpipe()" built-in function now checks at compile time that it
           has only one parameter expression, and puts it in scalar context,
           thus ensuring that it doesn't corrupt the stack at runtime.  [GH
           #2793] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/2793>

       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant

       have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.24.4:

       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
       generated from version control history.  In particular, it does not
       include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
       modules included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN
       community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please
       see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.

Reporting Bugs
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
       recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
       database at <https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
       <http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
       included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
       sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of "perl
       -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
       porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
       "SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec for details of
       how to report the issue.
