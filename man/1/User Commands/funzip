NAME
       funzip - filter for extracting from a ZIP archive in a pipe

SYNOPSIS
       funzip [-password] [input[.zip|.gz]]

ARGUMENTS
       [-password]
              Optional password to be used if ZIP archive is encrypted.
              Decryption may not be supported at some sites.  See DESCRIPTION
              for more details.

       [input[.zip|.gz]]
              Optional input archive file specification. See DESCRIPTION for
              details.

DESCRIPTION
       funzip without a file argument acts as a filter; that is, it assumes that
       a ZIP archive (or a gzip'd(1) file) is being piped into standard input,
       and it extracts the first member from the archive to stdout.  When stdin
       comes from a tty device, funzip assumes that this cannot be a stream of
       (binary) compressed data and shows a short help text, instead.  If there
       is a file argument, then input is read from the specified file instead of
       from stdin.

       A password for encrypted zip files can be specified on the command line
       (preceding the file name, if any) by prefixing the password with a dash.
       Note that this constitutes a security risk on many systems; currently
       running processes are often visible via simple commands (e.g., ps(1)
       under Unix), and command-line histories can be read.  If the first entry
       of the zip file is encrypted and no password is specified on the command
       line, then the user is prompted for a password and the password is not
       echoed on the console.

       Given the limitation on single-member extraction, funzip is most useful
       in conjunction with a secondary archiver program such as tar(1).  The
       following section includes an example illustrating this usage in the case
       of disk backups to tape.

EXAMPLES
       To use funzip to extract the first member file of the archive test.zip
       and to pipe it into more(1):

       funzip test.zip | more

       To use funzip to test the first member file of test.zip (any errors will
       be reported on standard error):

       funzip test.zip > /dev/null

       To use zip and funzip in place of compress(1) and zcat(1) (or gzip(1L)
       and gzcat(1L)) for tape backups:

       tar cf - . | zip -7 | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=8k
       dd if=/dev/nrst0 ibs=8k | funzip | tar xf -

       (where, for example, nrst0 is a SCSI tape drive).

BUGS
       When piping an encrypted file into more and allowing funzip to prompt for
       password, the terminal may sometimes be reset to a non-echo mode.  This
       is apparently due to a race condition between the two programs; funzip
       changes the terminal mode to non-echo before more reads its state, and
       more then ``restores'' the terminal to this mode before exiting.  To
       recover, run funzip on the same file but redirect to /dev/null rather
       than piping into more; after prompting again for the password, funzip
       will reset the terminal properly.

       There is presently no way to extract any member but the first from a ZIP
       archive.  This would be useful in the case where a ZIP archive is
       included within another archive.  In the case where the first member is a
       directory, funzip simply creates the directory and exits.

       The functionality of funzip should be incorporated into unzip itself
       (future release).
