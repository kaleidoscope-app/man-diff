NAME
       texi2dvi - print Texinfo documents

SYNOPSIS
       texi2dvi [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Run each Texinfo or LaTeX FILE through TeX in turn until all
       cross-references are resolved, building all indices.  The directory
       containing each FILE is searched for included files.  The suffix of FILE
       is used to determine its language (LaTeX or Texinfo).

       Makeinfo is used to perform Texinfo macro expansion before running TeX
       when needed.

   Operation modes:
       -b, --batch
              no interaction

       -c, --clean
              remove all auxiliary files

       -D, --debug
              turn on shell debugging (set -x)

       -h, --help
              display this help and exit successfully

       -o, --output=OFILE
              leave output in OFILE (implies --clean); Only one input FILE may
              be specified in this case

       -q, --quiet
              no output unless errors (implies --batch)

       -s, --silent
              same as --quiet

       -v, --version
              display version information and exit successfully

       -V, --verbose
              report on what is done

   TeX tuning:
       -@     use @input instead of \input; for preloaded Texinfo

       -e, -E, --expand
              force macro expansion using makeinfo

       -I DIR search DIR for Texinfo files

       -l, --language=LANG
              specify the LANG of FILE (LaTeX or Texinfo)

       -p, --pdf
              use pdftex or pdflatex for processing

       -r, --recode
              call recode before TeX to translate input characters

       -t, --command=CMD
              insert CMD in copy of input file

       or --texinfo=CMD
              multiple values accumulate

       The values of the BIBTEX, LATEX (or PDFLATEX), MAKEINDEX, MAKEINFO, TEX
       (or PDFTEX), TEXINDEX, and THUMBPDF environment variables are used to run
       those commands, if they are set.  Any CMD strings are added after
       @setfilename for Texinfo input, in the first line for LaTeX input.
