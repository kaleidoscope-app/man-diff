NAME
       afmtodit - create font files for use with groff -Tps

SYNOPSIS
afmtodit [-mnsvx] [-a n] [-d desc_file] [-e enc_file] [-i n] afm_file map_file
                font

       The whitespace between an command line option and its argument is
       optional.

DESCRIPTION
       afmtodit creates a font file for use with groff and grops.  afmtodit is
       written in perl; you must have perl version 5.004 or newer installed in
       order to run afmtodit.

       afm_file is the AFM (Adobe Font Metric) file for the font.

       map_file is a file that says which groff character names map onto each
       PostScript character name; this file should contain a sequence of lines
       of the form

              ps_char groff_char

       where ps_char is the PostScript name of the character and groff_char is
       the groff name of the character (as used in the groff font file).  The
       same ps_char can occur multiple times in the file; each groff_char must
       occur at most once.  Lines starting with # and blank lines are ignored.
       If the file isn't found in the current directory, it is searched in the
       `devps/generate' subdirectory of the default font directory.

       If a PostScript character is not named as uniXXXX (XXXX are four
       uppercase hexadecimal digits), and is not mentioned in map_file, and a
       generic groff glyph name can't be deduced using the Adobe Glyph List
       (AGL, built into afmtodit), then afmtodit puts the PostScript character
       into the groff font file as an unnamed character which can only be
       accessed by the \N escape sequence in troff.  If option -e is not
       specified, the encoding defined in the AFM file (i.e., entries with non-
       negative character codes) is used.  Please refer to section `Using
       Symbols' in the groff info file which describes how groff glyph names are
       constructed.

       Characters not encoded in the AFM file (i.e., entries which have -1 as
       the character code) are still available in groff; they get glyph index
       values greater than 255 (or greater than the biggest character code used
       in the AFM file in the unlikely case that it is greater than 255) in the
       groff font file.  Glyph indices of unencoded characters don't have a
       specific order; it is best to access them with glyph names only.

       The groff font file will be output to a file called font.

       If there is a downloadable font file for the font, it may be listed in
       the file /usr/share/groff/1.19.2/font/devps/download; see grops(1).

       If the -i option is used, afmtodit will automatically generate an italic
       correction, a left italic correction and a subscript correction for each
       character (the significance of these parameters is explained in
       groff_font(5)); these parameters may be specified for individual
       characters by adding to the afm_file lines of the form:

              italicCorrection ps_char_n
              leftItalicCorrection ps_char_n
              subscriptCorrection ps_char_n

       where ps_char is the PostScript name of the character, and n is the
       desired value of the corresponding parameter in thousandths of an em.
       These parameters are normally needed only for italic (or oblique) fonts.

OPTIONS
       -an    Use n as the slant parameter in the font file; this is used by
              groff in the positioning of accents.  By default afmtodit uses the
              negative of the ItalicAngle specified in the afm file; with true
              italic fonts it is sometimes desirable to use a slant that is less
              than this.  If you find that characters from an italic font have
              accents placed too far to the right over them, then use the -a
              option to give the font a smaller slant.

       -ddesc_file
              The device description file is desc_file rather than the default
              DESC.  If not found in the current directory, the `devps'
              subdirectory of the default font directory is searched (this is
              true for both the default device description file and a file given
              with option -d).

       -eenc_file
              The PostScript font should be reencoded to use the encoding
              described in enc_file.  The format of enc_file is described in
              grops(1).  If not found in the current directory, the `devps'
              subdirectory of the default font directory is searched.

       -in    Generate an italic correction for each character so that the
              character's width plus the character's italic correction is equal
              to n thousandths of an em plus the amount by which the right edge
              of the character's bounding box is to the right of the character's
              origin.  If this would result in a negative italic correction, use
              a zero italic correction instead.

              Also generate a subscript correction equal to the product of the
              tangent of the slant of the font and four fifths of the x-height
              of the font.  If this would result in a subscript correction
              greater than the italic correction, use a subscript correction
              equal to the italic correction instead.

              Also generate a left italic correction for each character equal to
              n thousandths of an em plus the amount by which the left edge of
              the character's bounding box is to the left of the character's
              origin.  The left italic correction may be negative unless option
              -m is given.

              This option is normally needed only with italic (or oblique)
              fonts.  The font files distributed with groff were created using
              an option of -i50 for italic fonts.

       -m     Prevent negative left italic correction values.  Roman font files
              distributed with groff were created with -i0 -m to improve spacing
              with eqn(1).

       -n     Don't output a ligatures command for this font.  Use this with
              constant-width fonts.

       -s     The font is special.  The effect of this option is to add the
              special command to the font file.

       -v     Print version.

       -x     Don't use the built-in Adobe Glyph List.
