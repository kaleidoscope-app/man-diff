POSTFIX(1)                   General Commands Manual                  POSTFIX(1)




NAME
       postfix - Postfix control program

SYNOPSIS
       postfix [-Dv] [-c config_dir] command

DESCRIPTION
       This command is reserved for the superuser. To submit mail, use the
       Postfix sendmail(1) command.

       The postfix(1) command controls the operation of the Postfix mail system:
       start or stop the master(8) daemon, do a health check, and other
       maintenance.

       By default, the postfix(1) command sets up a standardized environment and
       runs the postfix-script shell script to do the actual work.

       However, when support for multiple Postfix instances is configured,
       postfix(1) executes the command specified with the multi_instance_wrapper
       configuration parameter.  This command will execute the command for each
       applicable Postfix instance.

       The following commands are implemented:

       check  Warn about bad directory/file ownership or permissions, and create
              missing directories.

       start  Start the Postfix mail system. This also runs the configuration
              check described above.

       stop   Stop the Postfix mail system in an orderly fashion. If possible,
              running processes are allowed to terminate at their earliest
              convenience.

              Note: in order to refresh the Postfix mail system after a
              configuration change, do not use the start and stop commands in
              succession. Use the reload command instead.

       abort  Stop the Postfix mail system abruptly. Running processes are
              signaled to stop immediately.

       flush  Force delivery: attempt to deliver every message in the deferred
              mail queue. Normally, attempts to deliver delayed mail happen at
              regular intervals, the interval doubling after each failed
              attempt.

              Warning: flushing undeliverable mail frequently will result in
              poor delivery performance of all other mail.

       reload Re-read configuration files. Running processes terminate at their
              earliest convenience.

       status Indicate if the Postfix mail system is currently running.

       set-permissions [name=value ...]
              Set the ownership and permissions of Postfix related files and
              directories, as specified in the postfix-files file.

              Specify name=value to override and update specific main.cf
              configuration parameters. Use this, for example, to change the
              mail_owner or setgid_group setting for an already installed
              Postfix system.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.  With Postfix
              2.0 and earlier, use "$config_directory/post-install
              set-permissions".

       tls subcommand
              Enable opportunistic TLS in the Postfix SMTP client or server, and
              manage Postfix SMTP server TLS private keys and certificates.  See
              postfix-tls(1) for documentation.

              This feature is available in Postfix 3.1 and later.

       upgrade-configuration [name=value ...]
              Update the main.cf and master.cf files with information that
              Postfix needs in order to run: add or update services, and add or
              update configuration parameter settings.

              Specify name=value to override and update specific main.cf
              configuration parameters.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.  With Postfix
              2.0 and earlier, use "$config_directory/post-install
              upgrade-configuration".

       The following options are implemented:

       -c config_dir
              Read the main.cf and master.cf configuration files in the named
              directory instead of the default configuration directory.  Use
              this to distinguish between multiple Postfix instances on the same
              host.

              With Postfix 2.6 and later, this option forces the postfix(1)
              command to operate on the specified Postfix instance only.  This
              behavior is inherited by postfix(1) commands that run as a
              descendant of the current process.

       -D (with postfix start only)
              Run each Postfix daemon under control of a debugger as specified
              via the debugger_command configuration parameter.

       -v     Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple -v options
              make the software increasingly verbose.

ENVIRONMENT
       The postfix(1) command exports the following environment variables before
       executing the postfix-script file:

       MAIL_CONFIG
              This is set when the -c command-line option is present.

              With Postfix 2.6 and later, this environment variable forces the
              postfix(1) command to operate on the specified Postfix instance
              only.  This behavior is inherited by postfix(1) commands that run
              as a descendant of the current process.

       MAIL_VERBOSE
              This is set when the -v command-line option is present.

       MAIL_DEBUG
              This is set when the -D command-line option is present.

FILES
       Prior to Postfix version 2.6, all of the following files were in
       $config_directory. Some files are now in $daemon_directory so that they
       can be shared among multiple instances that run the same Postfix version.

       Use the command "postconf config_directory" or "postconf
       daemon_directory" to expand the names into their actual values.
