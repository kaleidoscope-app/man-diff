TIME(1)                      General Commands Manual                     TIME(1)

NAME
     time – time command execution

SYNOPSIS
     time [-al] [-h | -p] [-o file] utility [argument ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The time utility executes and times the specified utility.  After the
     utility finishes, time writes to the standard error stream, (in seconds):
     the total time elapsed, the time used to execute the utility process and
     the time consumed by system overhead.

     The following options are available:

     -a      If the -o flag is used, append to the specified file rather than
             overwriting it.  Otherwise, this option has no effect.

     -h      Print times in a human friendly format.  Times are printed in
             minutes, hours, etc. as appropriate.

     -l      The contents of the rusage structure are printed as well.

     -o file
             Write the output to file instead of stderr.  If file exists and the
             -a flag is not specified, the file will be overwritten.

     -p      Makes time output POSIX.2 compliant (each time is printed on its
             own line).

     Some shells may provide a builtin time command which is similar or
     identical to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.

     If time receives a SIGINFO (see the status argument for stty(1)) signal,
     the current time the given command is running will be written to the
     standard output.

ENVIRONMENT
     The PATH environment variable is used to locate the requested utility if
     the name contains no ‘/’ characters.

EXIT STATUS
     If utility could be timed successfully, its exit status is returned.  If
     utility terminated abnormally, a warning message is output to stderr.  If
     the utility was found but could not be run, the exit status is 126.  If no
     utility could be found at all, the exit status is 127.  If time encounters
     any other error, the exit status is between 1 and 125 included.

EXAMPLES
     Time the execution of ls(1) on an empty directory:

           $ /usr/bin/time ls
                   0.00 real         0.00 user         0.00 sys

     Time the execution of the cp(1) command and store the result in the
     times.txt file.  Then execute the command again to make a new copy and add
     the result to the same file:

           $ /usr/bin/time -o times.txt cp FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64-bootonly.iso copy1.iso
           $ /usr/bin/time -a -o times.txt cp FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-amd64-bootonly.iso copy2.iso

     The times.txt file will contain the times of both commands:

           $ cat times.txt
                   0.68 real         0.00 user         0.22 sys
                   0.67 real         0.00 user         0.21 sys

     Time the sleep(1) command and show the results in a human friendly format.
     Show the contents of the rusage structure too:

           $ /usr/bin/time -l -h -p sleep 5
           real 5.01
           user 0.00
           sys 0.00
