NAME
     time – time command execution

SYNOPSIS
     time [-lp] utility

DESCRIPTION
     The time utility executes and times utility.  After the utility finishes,
     time writes the total time elapsed, the time consumed by system overhead,
     and the time used to execute utility to the standard error stream.  Times
     are reported in seconds.

     Available options:

     -l      The contents of the rusage structure are printed.

     -p      The output is formatted as specified by IEEE Std 1003.2-1992
             (“POSIX.2”).

     Some shells may provide a builtin time command which is similar or
     identical to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The time utility shall exit with one of the following values:

     1-125   An error occurred in the time utility.

     126     The utility was found but could not be invoked.

     127     The utility could not be found.

     Otherwise, the exit status of time shall be that of utility.
