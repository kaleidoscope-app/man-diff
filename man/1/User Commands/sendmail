SENDMAIL(1)                  General Commands Manual                 SENDMAIL(1)




NAME
       sendmail - Postfix to Sendmail compatibility interface

SYNOPSIS
       sendmail [option ...] [recipient ...]

       mailq
       sendmail -bp

       newaliases
       sendmail -I

DESCRIPTION
       The Postfix sendmail(1) command implements the Postfix to Sendmail
       compatibility interface.  For the sake of compatibility with existing
       applications, some Sendmail command-line options are recognized but
       silently ignored.

       By default, Postfix sendmail(1) reads a message from standard input until
       EOF or until it reads a line with only a . character, and arranges for
       delivery.  Postfix sendmail(1) relies on the postdrop(1) command to
       create a queue file in the maildrop directory.

       Specific command aliases are provided for other common modes of
       operation:

       mailq  List the mail queue. Each entry shows the queue file ID, message
              size, arrival time, sender, and the recipients that still need to
              be delivered.  If mail could not be delivered upon the last
              attempt, the reason for failure is shown. The queue ID string is
              followed by an optional status character:

              *      The message is in the active queue, i.e. the message is
                     selected for delivery.

              !      The message is in the hold queue, i.e. no further delivery
                     attempt will be made until the mail is taken off hold.

              This mode of operation is implemented by executing the
              postqueue(1) command.

       newaliases
              Initialize the alias database.  If no input file is specified
              (with the -oA option, see below), the program processes the
              file(s) specified with the alias_database configuration parameter.
              If no alias database type is specified, the program uses the type
              specified with the default_database_type configuration parameter.
              This mode of operation is implemented by running the postalias(1)
              command.

              Note: it may take a minute or so before an alias database update
              becomes visible. Use the "postfix reload" command to eliminate
              this delay.

       These and other features can be selected by specifying the appropriate
       combination of command-line options. Some features are controlled by
       parameters in the main.cf configuration file.

       The following options are recognized:

       -Am (ignored)

       -Ac (ignored)
              Postfix sendmail uses the same configuration file regardless of
              whether or not a message is an initial submission.

       -B body_type
              The message body MIME type: 7BIT or 8BITMIME.

       -bd    Go into daemon mode. This mode of operation is implemented by
              executing the "postfix start" command.

       -bh (ignored)

       -bH (ignored)
              Postfix has no persistent host status database.

       -bi    Initialize alias database. See the newaliases command above.

       -bl    Go into daemon mode. To accept only local connections as with
              Sendmail´s -bl option, specify "inet_interfaces = loopback" in the
              Postfix main.cf configuration file.

       -bm    Read mail from standard input and arrange for delivery.  This is
              the default mode of operation.

       -bp    List the mail queue. See the mailq command above.

       -bs    Stand-alone SMTP server mode. Read SMTP commands from standard
              input, and write responses to standard output.  In stand-alone
              SMTP server mode, mail relaying and other access controls are
              disabled by default. To enable them, run the process as the
              mail_owner user.

              This mode of operation is implemented by running the smtpd(8)
              daemon.

       -bv    Do not collect or deliver a message. Instead, send an email report
              after verifying each recipient address.  This is useful for
              testing address rewriting and routing configurations.

              This feature is available in Postfix version 2.1 and later.

       -C config_file

       -C config_dir
              The path name of the Postfix main.cf file, or of its parent
              directory. This information is ignored with Postfix versions
              before 2.3.

              With Postfix version 3.2 and later, a non-default directory must
              be authorized in the default main.cf file, through the
              alternate_config_directories or multi_instance_directories
              parameters.

              With all Postfix versions, you can specify a directory pathname
              with the MAIL_CONFIG environment variable to override the location
              of configuration files.

       -F full_name
              Set the sender full name. This overrides the NAME environment
              variable, and is used only with messages that have no From:
              message header.

       -f sender
              Set the envelope sender address. This is the address where
              delivery problems are sent to. With Postfix versions before 2.1,
              the Errors-To: message header overrides the error return address.

       -G     Gateway (relay) submission, as opposed to initial user submission.
              Either do not rewrite addresses at all, or update incomplete
              addresses with the domain information specified with
              remote_header_rewrite_domain.

              This option is ignored before Postfix version 2.3.

       -h hop_count (ignored)
              Hop count limit. Use the hopcount_limit configuration parameter
              instead.

       -I     Initialize alias database. See the newaliases command above.

       -i     When reading a message from standard input, don´t treat a line
              with only a . character as the end of input.

       -L label (ignored)
              The logging label. Use the syslog_name configuration parameter
              instead.

       -m (ignored)
              Backwards compatibility.

       -N dsn (default: 'delay, failure')
              Delivery status notification control. Specify either a
              comma-separated list with one or more of failure (send
              notification when delivery fails), delay (send notification when
              delivery is delayed), or success (send notification when the
              message is delivered); or specify never (don't send any
              notifications at all).

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

       -n (ignored)
              Backwards compatibility.

       -oAalias_database
              Non-default alias database. Specify pathname or type:pathname. See
              postalias(1) for details.

       -O option=value (ignored)
              Set the named option to value. Use the equivalent configuration
              parameter in main.cf instead.

       -o7 (ignored)

       -o8 (ignored)
              To send 8-bit or binary content, use an appropriate MIME
              encapsulation and specify the appropriate -B command-line option.

       -oi    When reading a message from standard input, don´t treat a line
              with only a . character as the end of input.

       -om (ignored)
              The sender is never eliminated from alias etc. expansions.

       -o x value (ignored)
              Set option x to value. Use the equivalent configuration parameter
              in main.cf instead.

       -r sender
              Set the envelope sender address. This is the address where
              delivery problems are sent to. With Postfix versions before 2.1,
              the Errors-To: message header overrides the error return address.

       -R return
              Delivery status notification control.  Specify "hdrs" to return
              only the header when a message bounces, "full" to return a full
              copy (the default behavior).

              The -R option specifies an upper bound; Postfix will return only
              the header, when a full copy would exceed the bounce_size_limit
              setting.

              This option is ignored before Postfix version 2.10.

       -q     Attempt to deliver all queued mail. This is implemented by
              executing the postqueue(1) command.

              Warning: flushing undeliverable mail frequently will result in
              poor delivery performance of all other mail.

       -qinterval (ignored)
              The interval between queue runs. Use the queue_run_delay
              configuration parameter instead.

       -qIqueueid
              Schedule immediate delivery of mail with the specified queue ID.
              This option is implemented by executing the postqueue(1) command,
              and is available with Postfix version 2.4 and later.

       -qRsite
              Schedule immediate delivery of all mail that is queued for the
              named site. This option accepts only site names that are eligible
              for the "fast flush" service, and is implemented by executing the
              postqueue(1) command.  See flush(8) for more information about the
              "fast flush" service.

       -qSsite
              This command is not implemented. Use the slower "sendmail -q"
              command instead.

       -t     Extract recipients from message headers. These are added to any
              recipients specified on the command line.

              With Postfix versions prior to 2.1, this option requires that no
              recipient addresses are specified on the command line.

       -U (ignored)
              Initial user submission.

       -V envid
              Specify the envelope ID for notification by servers that support
              DSN.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

       -XV (Postfix 2.2 and earlier: -V)
              Variable Envelope Return Path. Given an envelope sender address of
              the form owner-listname@origin, each recipient user@domain
              receives mail with a personalized envelope sender address.

              By default, the personalized envelope sender address is
              owner-listname+user=domain@origin. The default + and = characters
              are configurable with the default_verp_delimiters configuration
              parameter.

       -XVxy (Postfix 2.2 and earlier: -Vxy)
              As -XV, but uses x and y as the VERP delimiter characters, instead
              of the characters specified with the default_verp_delimiters
              configuration parameter.

       -v     Send an email report of the first delivery attempt (Postfix
              versions 2.1 and later). Mail delivery always happens in the
              background. When multiple -v options are given, enable verbose
              logging for debugging purposes.

       -X log_file (ignored)
              Log mailer traffic. Use the debug_peer_list and debug_peer_level
              configuration parameters instead.

SECURITY
       By design, this program is not set-user (or group) id. However, it must
       handle data from untrusted, possibly remote, users.  Thus, the usual
       precautions need to be taken against malicious inputs.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Problems are logged to syslogd(8) and to the standard error stream.
