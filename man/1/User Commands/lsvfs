LSVFS(1)                     General Commands Manual                    LSVFS(1)

NAME
     lsvfs – list installed virtual file systems

SYNOPSIS
     lsvfs [vfsname ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The lsvfs command lists information about the currently loaded virtual file
     system modules.  When vfsname arguments are given, lsvfs lists information
     about the specified VFS modules.  Otherwise, lsvfs lists all currently
     loaded modules.  The information is as follows:

     Filesystem  the name of the file system, as would be used in the type
                 parameter to mount(2) and the -t option to mount(8)
     Refs        the number of references to this VFS; i.e., the number of
                 currently mounted file systems of this type
     Flags       flag bits.

EXAMPLES
     Show information about the ‘apfs’ and ‘devfs’ filesystems and check the
     number of mounts for the former:

           $ lsvfs apfs devfs
           Filesystem                        Refs Flags
           -------------------------------- ----- ---------------
           apfs                                 5 local
           devfs                                1

           $ mount -t apfs | wc -l
                  5
