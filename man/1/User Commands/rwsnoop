rwsnoop(1m)                       USER COMMANDS                      rwsnoop(1m)



NAME
       rwsnoop - snoop read/write events. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       rwsnoop [-jPtvZ] [-n name] [-p PID]

DESCRIPTION
       This is measuring reads and writes at the application level. This matches
       the syscalls read, write, pread and pwrite.

       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

OPTIONS
       -j     print project ID

       -P     print parent process ID

       -t     print timestamp, us

       -v     print time, string

       -Z     print zone ID

       -n name
              process name to track

       -p PID PID to track

EXAMPLES
       Default output,
              # rwsnoop

       Print zone ID,
              # rwsnoop -

       Monitor processes named "bash",
              # rwsnoop -n bash

FIELDS
       TIME   timestamp, us

       TIMESTR
              time, string

       ZONE   zone ID

       PROJ   project ID

       UID    user ID

       PID    process ID

       PPID   parent process ID

       CMD    command name for the process

       D      direction, Read or Write

       BYTES  total bytes during sample

       FILE   filename, if file based.  Reads and writes that are not file
              based, for example with sockets, will print "<unknown>" as the
              filename.

DOCUMENTATION

       The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with verbose
       descriptions explaining the output.
