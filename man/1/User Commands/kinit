DESCRIPTION
     kinit is used to authenticate to the Kerberos server as principal, or if
     none is given, a system generated default (typically your login name at the
     default realm), and acquire a ticket granting ticket that can later be used
     to obtain tickets for other services.

     Supported options:

     -c cachename --cache=cachename
             The credentials cache to put the acquired ticket in, if other than
             default.

     -canonicalize
             ask the KDC canonicalize the client name and server name. Useful
             with enterprise names, PK-INIT, and LKDC realms when the user
             doesn't know its real kerberos user name.

     -f, --forwardable
             Get ticket that can be forwarded to another host.

     -t keytabname, --keytab=keytabname

     -f --no-forwardable
             Get ticket that can be forwarded to another host, or if the
             negative flags use, don't get a forwardable flag.

     -t keytabname, --keytab=keytabname
             Don't ask for a password, but instead get the key from the
             specified keytab.

     -l time, --lifetime=time
             Specifies the lifetime of the ticket.  The argument can either be
             in seconds, or a more human readable string like ‘1h’.

     -p, --proxiable
             Request tickets with the proxiable flag set.

     -R, --renew
             Try to renew ticket.  The ticket must have the ‘renewable’ flag
             set, and must not be expired.

     --renewable
             The same as --renewable-life, with an infinite time.

     -r time, --renewable-life=time
             The max renewable ticket life.

     -S principal, --server=principal
             Get a ticket for a service other than krbtgt/LOCAL.REALM.

     -s time, --start-time=time
             Obtain a ticket that starts to be valid time (which can really be a
             generic time specification, like ‘1h’) seconds into the future.

     -k, --use-keytab
             The same as --keytab, but with the default keytab name (normally
             FILE:/etc/krb5.keytab).

     -v, --validate
             Try to validate an invalid ticket.

     -e, --enctypes=enctypes
             Request tickets with this particular enctype.

     --password-file=filename
             read the password from the first line of filename.  If the filename
             is STDIN, the password will be read from the standard input.

     --fcache-version=version-number
             Create a credentials cache of version version-number.

     -a, --extra-addresses=enctypes
             Adds a set of addresses that will, in addition to the systems local
             addresses, be put in the ticket.  This can be useful if all
             addresses a client can use can't be automatically figured out.  One
             such example is if the client is behind a firewall.  Also settable
             via libdefaults/extra_addresses in krb5.conf(5).

     -A, --no-addresses
             Request a ticket with no addresses.

     --anonymous
             Request an anonymous ticket (which means that the ticket will be
             issued to an anonymous principal, typically “anonymous@REALM”).

     -V, --verbose
             Print slightly more verbose output from kinit when successful.

     --enterprise
             Parse principal as a enterprise (KRB5-NT-ENTERPRISE) name.
             Enterprise names are email like principals that are stored in the
             name part of the principal, and since there are two @ characters
             the parser needs to know that the first is not a realm.  An example
             of an enterprise name is “lha@e.kth.se@KTH.SE”, and this option is
             usually used with canonicalize so that the principal returned from
             the KDC will typically be the real principal name.

     --afslog
             Gets AFS tickets, converts them to version 4 format, and stores
             them in the kernel.  Only useful if you have AFS.

     The forwardable, proxiable, ticket_life, and renewable_life options can be
     set to a default value from the appdefaults section in krb5.conf, see
     krb5_appdefault(3).

     If  a command is given, kinit will set up new credentials caches, and AFS
     PAG, and then run the given command.  When it finishes the credentials will
     be removed.

ENVIRONMENT
     KRB5CCNAME
             Specifies the default credentials cache.

     KRB5_CONFIG
             The file name of krb5.conf, the default being /etc/krb5.conf.

     KRBTKFILE
             Specifies the Kerberos 4 ticket file to store version 4 tickets in.
