NAME
       perl5263delta - what is new for perl v5.26.3

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes differences between the 5.26.2 release and the
       5.26.3 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.26.1, first read
       perl5262delta, which describes differences between 5.26.1 and 5.26.2.

Security
   [CVE-2018-12015] Directory traversal in module Archive::Tar
       By default, Archive::Tar doesn't allow extracting files outside the
       current working directory.  However, this secure extraction mode could be
       bypassed by putting a symlink and a regular file with the same name into
       the tar file.

       [GH #16580] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16580> [cpan #125523]
       <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125523>

   [CVE-2018-18311] Integer overflow leading to buffer overflow and segmentation
       fault
       Integer arithmetic in "Perl_my_setenv()" could wrap when the combined
       length of the environment variable name and value exceeded around
       0x7fffffff.  This could lead to writing beyond the end of an allocated
       buffer with attacker supplied data.

       [GH #16560] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16560>

   [CVE-2018-18312] Heap-buffer-overflow write in S_regatom (regcomp.c)
       A crafted regular expression could cause heap-buffer-overflow write
       during compilation, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.

       [GH #16649] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16649>

   [CVE-2018-18313] Heap-buffer-overflow read in S_grok_bslash_N (regcomp.c)
       A crafted regular expression could cause heap-buffer-overflow read during
       compilation, potentially leading to sensitive information being leaked.

       [GH #16554] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16554>

   [CVE-2018-18314] Heap-buffer-overflow write in S_regatom (regcomp.c)
       A crafted regular expression could cause heap-buffer-overflow write
       during compilation, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.

       [GH #16041] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16041>

Incompatible Changes
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.26.2.  If any
       exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report.  See
       "Reporting Bugs" below.

Modules and Pragmata
   Updated Modules and Pragmata
       •   Archive::Tar has been upgraded from version 2.24 to 2.24_01.

       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 5.20180414_26 to
           5.20181129_26.

Diagnostics
       The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic output,
       including warnings and fatal error messages.  For the complete list of
       diagnostic messages, see perldiag.

   New Diagnostics
       New Errors

       •   Unexpected ']' with no following ')' in (?[... in regex; marked by
           <-- HERE in m/%s/

           (F) While parsing an extended character class a ']' character was
           encountered at a point in the definition where the only legal use of
           ']' is to close the character class definition as part of a '])', you
           may have forgotten the close paren, or otherwise confused the parser.

       •   Expecting close paren for nested extended charclass in regex; marked
           by <-- HERE in m/%s/

           (F) While parsing a nested extended character class like:

               (?[ ... (?flags:(?[ ... ])) ... ])
                                        ^

           we expected to see a close paren ')' (marked by ^) but did not.

       •   Expecting close paren for wrapper for nested extended charclass in
           regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/%s/

           (F) While parsing a nested extended character class like:

               (?[ ... (?flags:(?[ ... ])) ... ])
                                         ^

           we expected to see a close paren ')' (marked by ^) but did not.

   Changes to Existing Diagnostics
       •   Syntax error in (?[...]) in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/%s/

           This fatal error message has been slightly expanded (from "Syntax
           error in (?[...]) in regex m/%s/") for greater clarity.

Acknowledgements
       Perl 5.26.3 represents approximately 8 months of development since Perl
       5.26.2 and contains approximately 4,500 lines of changes across 51 files
       from 15 authors.

       Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there
       were approximately 770 lines of changes to 10 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant
       community of users and developers.  The following people are known to
       have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.26.3:

       Aaron Crane, Abigail, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsaaker,
       David Mitchell, H.Merijn Brand, James E Keenan, John SJ Anderson, Karen
       Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Sawyer X, Steve Hay, Todd Rinaldo, Tony Cook,
       Yves Orton.

       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
       generated from version control history.  In particular, it does not
       include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
       modules included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN
       community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please
       see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.

Reporting Bugs
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug
       database at <https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
       <http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
       included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
       sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of "perl
       -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
       porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
       "SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec for details of
       how to report the issue.

Give Thanks
       If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl
       5, you can do so by running the "perlthanks" program:

           perlthanks

       This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of
       thanks.
