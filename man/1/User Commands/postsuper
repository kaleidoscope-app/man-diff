POSTSUPER(1)                 General Commands Manual                POSTSUPER(1)




NAME
       postsuper - Postfix superintendent

SYNOPSIS
       postsuper [-psSv] [-c config_dir] [-d queue_id]
               [-h queue_id] [-H queue_id]
               [-r queue_id] [directory ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The postsuper(1) command does maintenance jobs on the Postfix queue. Use
       of the command is restricted to the superuser.  See the postqueue(1)
       command for unprivileged queue operations such as listing or flushing the
       mail queue.

       By default, postsuper(1) performs the operations requested with the -s
       and -p command-line options on all Postfix queue directories - this
       includes the incoming, active and deferred directories with mail files
       and the bounce, defer, trace and flush directories with log files.

       Options:

       -c config_dir
              The main.cf configuration file is in the named directory instead
              of the default configuration directory. See also the MAIL_CONFIG
              environment setting below.

       -d queue_id
              Delete one message with the named queue ID from the named mail
              queue(s) (default: hold, incoming, active and deferred).

              To delete multiple files, specify the -d option multiple times, or
              specify a queue_id of - to read queue IDs from standard input. For
              example, to delete all mail with exactly one recipient
              user@example.com:

              mailq | tail -n +2 | grep -v '^ *(' | awk  'BEGIN { RS = "" }
                  # $7=sender, $8=recipient1, $9=recipient2
                  { if ($8 == "user@example.com" && $9 == "")
                        print $1 }
               ' | tr -d '*!' | postsuper -d -

              Specify "-d ALL" to remove all messages; for example, specify "-d
              ALL deferred" to delete all mail in the deferred queue.  As a
              safety measure, the word ALL must be specified in upper case.

              Warning: Postfix queue IDs are reused (always with Postfix <= 2.8;
              and with Postfix >= 2.9 when enable_long_queue_ids=no).  There is
              a very small possibility that postsuper deletes the wrong message
              file when it is executed while the Postfix mail system is
              delivering mail.

              The scenario is as follows:

              1)     The Postfix queue manager deletes the message that
                     postsuper(1) is asked to delete, because Postfix is
                     finished with the message (it is delivered, or it is
                     returned to the sender).

              2)     New mail arrives, and the new message is given the same
                     queue ID as the message that postsuper(1) is supposed to
                     delete.  The probability for reusing a deleted queue ID is
                     about 1 in 2**15 (the number of different microsecond
                     values that the system clock can distinguish within a
                     second).

              3)     postsuper(1) deletes the new message, instead of the old
                     message that it should have deleted.

       -h queue_id
              Put mail "on hold" so that no attempt is made to deliver it.  Move
              one message with the named queue ID from the named mail queue(s)
              (default: incoming, active and deferred) to the hold queue.

              To hold multiple files, specify the -h option multiple times, or
              specify a queue_id of - to read queue IDs from standard input.

              Specify "-h ALL" to hold all messages; for example, specify "-h
              ALL deferred" to hold all mail in the deferred queue.  As a safety
              measure, the word ALL must be specified in upper case.

              Note: while mail is "on hold" it will not expire when its time in
              the queue exceeds the maximal_queue_lifetime or
              bounce_queue_lifetime setting. It becomes subject to expiration
              after it is released from "hold".

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

       -H queue_id
              Release mail that was put "on hold".  Move one message with the
              named queue ID from the named mail queue(s) (default: hold) to the
              deferred queue.

              To release multiple files, specify the -H option multiple times,
              or specify a queue_id of - to read queue IDs from standard input.

              Note: specify "postsuper -r" to release mail that was kept on hold
              for a significant fraction of $maximal_queue_lifetime or
              $bounce_queue_lifetime, or longer.

              Specify "-H ALL" to release all mail that is "on hold".  As a
              safety measure, the word ALL must be specified in upper case.

              This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

       -p     Purge old temporary files that are left over after system or
              software crashes.

       -r queue_id
              Requeue the message with the named queue ID from the named mail
              queue(s) (default: hold, incoming, active and deferred).

              To requeue multiple files, specify the -r option multiple times,
              or specify a queue_id of - to read queue IDs from standard input.

              Specify "-r ALL" to requeue all messages. As a safety measure, the
              word ALL must be specified in upper case.

              A requeued message is moved to the maildrop queue, from where it
              is copied by the pickup(8) and cleanup(8) daemons to a new queue
              file. In many respects its handling differs from that of a new
              local submission.

              •      The message is not subjected to the smtpd_milters or
                     non_smtpd_milters settings.  When mail has passed through
                     an external content filter, this would produce incorrect
                     results with Milter applications that depend on original
                     SMTP connection state information.

              •      The message is subjected again to mail address rewriting
                     and substitution.  This is useful when rewriting rules or
                     virtual mappings have changed.

                     The address rewriting context (local or remote) is the same
                     as when the message was received.

              •      The message is subjected to the same content_filter
                     settings (if any) as used for new local mail submissions.
                     This is useful when content_filter settings have changed.

              Warning: Postfix queue IDs are reused (always with Postfix <= 2.8;
              and with Postfix >= 2.9 when enable_long_queue_ids=no).  There is
              a very small possibility that postsuper(1) requeues the wrong
              message file when it is executed while the Postfix mail system is
              running, but no harm should be done.

              This feature is available in Postfix 1.1 and later.

       -s     Structure check and structure repair.  This should be done once
              before Postfix startup.

              •      Rename files whose name does not match the message file
                     inode number. This operation is necessary after restoring a
                     mail queue from a different machine or from backup, when
                     queue files were created with Postfix <= 2.8 or with
                     "enable_long_queue_ids = no".

              •      Move queue files that are in the wrong place in the file
                     system hierarchy and remove subdirectories that are no
                     longer needed.  File position rearrangements are necessary
                     after a change in the hash_queue_names and/or
                     hash_queue_depth configuration parameters.

              •      Rename queue files created with "enable_long_queue_ids =
                     yes" to short names, for migration to Postfix <= 2.8.  The
                     procedure is as follows:

                     # postfix stop
                     # postconf enable_long_queue_ids=no
                     # postsuper

                     Run postsuper(1) repeatedly until it stops reporting file
                     name changes.

       -S     A redundant version of -s that requires that long file names also
              match the message file inode number. This option exists for
              testing purposes, and is available with Postfix 2.9 and later.

       -v     Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple -v options
              make the software increasingly verbose.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Problems are reported to the standard error stream and to syslogd(8).

       postsuper(1) reports the number of messages deleted with -d, the number
       of messages requeued with -r, and the number of messages whose queue file
       name was fixed with -s. The report is written to the standard error
       stream and to syslogd(8).

ENVIRONMENT

       MAIL_CONFIG
              Directory with the main.cf file.

BUGS
       Mail that is not sanitized by Postfix (i.e. mail in the maildrop queue)
       cannot be placed "on hold".
