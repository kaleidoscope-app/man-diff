NFSSTAT(1)                   General Commands Manual                  NFSSTAT(1)

NAME
     nfsstat â€“ display NFS statistics

SYNOPSIS
     nfsstat [-cseuv] [-w wait] [-n net|user] [-m [mountpath]]

DESCRIPTION
     nfsstat displays statistics kept about NFS client and server activity,
     active user activity, exported directories, and mount information.  In the
     absence of any options, nfsstat displays NFS client and server statistics.

     The options are as follows:

     -c      Show NFS client statistics.

     -e      Show NFS server exported directory statistics.

     -m [mountpath]
             Show NFS mount information.

     -s      Show NFS server statistics.

     -3      Print only NFS v3 statistics.

     -4      Print only NFS v4 statistics.

     -u      Show NFS server active user statistics.

     -f JSON
             Print output as JSON format.

     -w wait
             Display a shorter summary at wait second intervals.

     -n net|user
             Show network addresses as numbers, or show users as uid numbers.
             This option can appear multiple times.

     -z      Zero NFS client and server statistics.

     -v      Show additional information (if available).
