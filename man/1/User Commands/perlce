NAME
       perlce - Perl for WinCE

Building Perl for WinCE
   WARNING
       Much of this document has become very out of date and needs updating,
       rewriting or deleting. The build process was overhauled during the 5.19
       development track and the current instructions as of that time are given
       in "CURRENT BUILD INSTRUCTIONS"; the previous build instructions, which
       are largely superseded but may still contain some useful information, are
       left in "OLD BUILD INSTRUCTIONS" but really need removing after anything
       of use has been extracted from them.

   DESCRIPTION
       This file gives the instructions for building Perl5.8 and above for
       WinCE.  Please read and understand the terms under which this software is
       distributed.

   General explanations on cross-compiling WinCE
       •   miniperl is built. This is a single executable (without DLL),
           intended to run on Win32, and it will facilitate remaining build
           process; all binaries built after it are foreign and should not run
           locally.

           miniperl is built using ./win32/Makefile; this is part of normal
           build process invoked as dependency from wince/Makefile.ce

       •   After miniperl is built, configpm is invoked to create right
           Config.pm in right place and its corresponding Cross.pm.

           Unlike Win32 build, miniperl will not have Config.pm of host within
           reach; it rather will use Config.pm from within cross-compilation
           directories.

           File Cross.pm is dead simple: for given cross-architecture places in
           @INC a path where perl modules are, and right Config.pm in that
           place.

           That said, "miniperl -Ilib -MConfig -we 1" should report an error,
           because it can not find Config.pm. If it does not give an error --
           wrong Config.pm is substituted, and resulting binaries will be a
           mess.

           "miniperl -MCross -MConfig -we 1" should run okay, and it will
           provide right Config.pm for further compilations.

       •   During extensions build phase, a script ./win32/buildext.pl is
           invoked, which in turn steps in ./ext subdirectories and performs a
           build of each extension in turn.

           All invokes of Makefile.PL are provided with "-MCross" so to enable
           cross- compile.

   CURRENT BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
       (These instructions assume the host is 32-bit Windows. If you're on
       64-bit Windows then change "C:\Program Files" to "C:\Program Files (x86)"
       throughout.)

       1. Install EVC4 from

        http://download.microsoft.com/download/c/3/f/c3f8b58b-9753-4c2e-8b96-2dfe3476a2f7/eVC4.exe

       Use the key mentioned at

        http://download.cnet.com/Microsoft-eMbedded-Visual-C/3000-2212_4-10108490.html?tag=bc

       The installer is ancient and has a few bugs on the paths it uses. You
       will have to fix them later. Basically, some things go into "C:/Program
       Files/Windows CE Tools", others go into "C:/Windows CE Tools" regardless
       of the path you gave to the installer (the default will be "C:/Windows CE
       Tools"). Reboots will be required for the installer to proceed. Also .c
       and .h associations with Visual Studio might get overridden when
       installing EVC4. You have been warned.

       2. Download celib from GitHub (using "Download ZIP") at

           https://github.com/bulk88/celib

       Extract it to a spaceless path but not into the perl build source.  I
       call this directory "celib-palm-3.0" but in the GitHub snapshot it will
       be called "celib-master". Make a copy of the
       "wince-arm-pocket-wce300-release" folder and rename the copy to
       "wince-arm-pocket-wce400". This is a hack so we can build a CE 4.0 binary
       by linking in CE 3.0 ARM asm; the linker doesn't care. Windows
       Mobile/WinCE are backwards compatible with machine code like Desktop
       Windows.

       3. Download console-1.3-src.tar.gz from

        http://sourceforge.net/projects/perlce/files/PerlCE%20support%20files/console/

       Extract it to a spaceless path but not into the perl build source.  Don't
       extract it into the same directory as celib. Make a copy of the
       "wince-arm-pocket-wce300" folder and rename the copy to
       "wince-arm-pocket-wce400". This is a hack so we can build a CE 4.0 binary
       by linking in CE 3.0 ARM asm; the linker doesn't care. Windows
       Mobile/WinCE are backwards compatible with machine code like Desktop
       Windows.

       4. Open a command prompt, run your regular batch file to set the
       environment for desktop Visual C building, goto the perl source
       directory, cd into win32/, fill out Makefile, and do a "nmake all" to
       build a Desktop Perl.

       5. Open win32/Makefile.ce in a text editor and do something similar to
       the following patch.

           -CELIBDLLDIR  = h:\src\wince\celib-palm-3.0
           -CECONSOLEDIR = h:\src\wince\w32console
           +CELIBDLLDIR  = C:\sources\celib-palm-3.0
           +CECONSOLEDIR = C:\sources\w32console

       Also change

           !if "$(MACHINE)" == ""
           MACHINE=wince-arm-hpc-wce300
           #MACHINE=wince-arm-hpc-wce211
           #MACHINE=wince-sh3-hpc-wce211
           #MACHINE=wince-mips-hpc-wce211
           #MACHINE=wince-sh3-hpc-wce200
           #MACHINE=wince-mips-hpc-wce200
           #MACHINE=wince-arm-pocket-wce300
           #MACHINE=wince-mips-pocket-wce300
           #MACHINE=wince-sh3-pocket-wce300
           #MACHINE=wince-x86em-pocket-wce300
           #MACHINE=wince-mips-palm-wce211
           #MACHINE=wince-sh3-palm-wce211
           #MACHINE=wince-x86em-palm-wce211
           #MACHINE=wince-x86-hpc-wce300
           #MACHINE=wince-arm-pocket-wce400
           !endif

       to

           !if "$(MACHINE)" == ""
           #MACHINE=wince-arm-hpc-wce300
           #MACHINE=wince-arm-hpc-wce211
           #MACHINE=wince-sh3-hpc-wce211
           #MACHINE=wince-mips-hpc-wce211
           #MACHINE=wince-sh3-hpc-wce200
           #MACHINE=wince-mips-hpc-wce200
           #MACHINE=wince-arm-pocket-wce300
           #MACHINE=wince-mips-pocket-wce300
           #MACHINE=wince-sh3-pocket-wce300
           #MACHINE=wince-x86em-pocket-wce300
           #MACHINE=wince-mips-palm-wce211
           #MACHINE=wince-sh3-palm-wce211
           #MACHINE=wince-x86em-palm-wce211
           #MACHINE=wince-x86-hpc-wce300
           MACHINE=wince-arm-pocket-wce400
           !endif

       so wince-arm-pocket-wce400 is the MACHINE type.

       6. Use a text editor to open "C:\Program Files\Microsoft eMbedded C++
       4.0\EVC\WCE400\BIN\WCEARMV4.BAT". Look for

           if "%SDKROOT%"=="" set SDKROOT=...

       On a new install it is "C:\Windows CE Tools". Goto "C:\Windows CE Tools"
       in a file manager and see if "C:\Windows CE
       Tools\wce400\STANDARDSDK\Include\Armv4" exists on your disk. If not the
       SDKROOT need to be changed to "C:\Program Files\Windows CE Tools".

       Goto celib-palm-3.0\inc\cewin32.h, search for

           typedef struct _ABC {

       and uncomment the struct.

       7. Open another command prompt, ensure PLATFORM is not set to anything
       already unless you know what you're doing (so that the correct default
       value is set by the next command), and run "C:\Program Files\Microsoft
       eMbedded C++ 4.0\EVC\WCE400\BIN\WCEARMV4.BAT"

       8. In the WinCE command prompt you made with WCEARMV4.BAT, goto the perl
       source directory, cd into win32/ and run "nmake -f Makefile.ce".

       9. The ARM perl interpreter (perl519.dll and perl.exe) will be in
       something like "C:\perl519\src\win32\wince-arm-pocket-wce400", with the
       XS DLLs in "C:\perl519\src\xlib\wince-arm-hpc-wce400\auto".

       To prove success on the host machine, run "dumpbin /headers
       wince-arm-pocket-wce400\perl.exe" from the win32/ folder and look for
       "machine (ARM)" in the FILE HEADER VALUES and "subsystem (Windows CE
       GUI)" in the OPTIONAL HEADER VALUES.

   OLD BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
       This section describes the steps to be performed to build PerlCE.  You
       may find additional information about building perl for WinCE at
       <http://perlce.sourceforge.net> and some pre-built binaries.

       Tools & SDK

       For compiling, you need following:

       •   Microsoft Embedded Visual Tools

       •   Microsoft Visual C++

       •   Rainer Keuchel's celib-sources

       •   Rainer Keuchel's console-sources

       Needed source files can be downloaded at <http://perlce.sourceforge.net>

       Make

       Normally you only need to edit ./win32/ce-helpers/compile.bat to reflect
       your system and run it.

       File ./win32/ce-helpers/compile.bat is actually a wrapper to call "nmake
       -f makefile.ce" with appropriate parameters and it accepts extra
       parameters and forwards them to "nmake" command as additional arguments.
       You should pass target this way.

       To prepare distribution you need to do following:

       •   go to ./win32 subdirectory

       •   edit file ./win32/ce-helpers/compile.bat

       •   run
             compile.bat

       •   run
             compile.bat dist

       Makefile.ce has "CROSS_NAME" macro, and it is used further to refer to
       your cross-compilation scheme. You could assign a name to it, but this is
       not necessary, because by default it is assigned after your machine
       configuration name, such as "wince-sh3-hpc-wce211", and this is enough to
       distinguish different builds at the same time. This option could be handy
       for several different builds on same platform to perform, say, threaded
       build. In a following example we assume that all required environment
       variables are set properly for C cross-compiler (a special *.bat file
       could fit perfectly to this purpose) and your compile.bat has proper
       "MACHINE" parameter set, to, say, "wince-mips-pocket-wce300".

         compile.bat
         compile.bat dist
         compile.bat CROSS_NAME=mips-wce300-thr "USE_ITHREADS=define" ^
           "USE_IMP_SYS=define" "USE_MULTI=define"
         compile.bat CROSS_NAME=mips-wce300-thr "USE_ITHREADS=define" ^
           "USE_IMP_SYS=define" "USE_MULTI=define" dist

       If all goes okay and no errors during a build, you'll get two independent
       distributions: "wince-mips-pocket-wce300" and "mips-wce300-thr".

       Target "dist" prepares distribution file set. Target "zipdist" performs
       same as "dist" but additionally compresses distribution files into zip
       archive.

       NOTE: during a build there could be created a number (or one) of
       Config.pm for cross-compilation ("foreign" Config.pm) and those are
       hidden inside ../xlib/$(CROSS_NAME) with other auxiliary files, but, and
       this is important to note, there should be no Config.pm for host
       miniperl.  If you'll get an error that perl could not find Config.pm
       somewhere in building process this means something went wrong. Most
       probably you forgot to specify a cross-compilation when invoking
       miniperl.exe to Makefile.PL When building an extension for cross-
       compilation your command line should look like

         ..\miniperl.exe -I..\lib -MCross=mips-wce300-thr Makefile.PL

       or just

         ..\miniperl.exe -I..\lib -MCross Makefile.PL

       to refer a cross-compilation that was created last time.

       All questions related to building for WinCE devices could be asked in
       perlce-user@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.

Using Perl on WinCE
   DESCRIPTION
       PerlCE is currently linked with a simple console window, so it also works
       on non-hpc devices.

       The simple stdio implementation creates the files stdin.txt, stdout.txt
       and stderr.txt, so you might examine them if your console has only a
       limited number of cols.

       When exitcode is non-zero, a message box appears, otherwise the console
       closes, so you might have to catch an exit with status 0 in your program
       to see any output.

       stdout/stderr now go into the files /perl-stdout.txt and
       /perl-stderr.txt.

       PerlIDE is handy to deal with perlce.

   LIMITATIONS
       No fork(), pipe(), popen() etc.

   ENVIRONMENT
       All environment vars must be stored in HKLM\Environment as strings. They
       are read at process startup.

       PERL5LIB
           Usual perl lib path (semi-list).

       PATH
           Semi-list for executables.

       TMP - Tempdir.

       UNIXROOTPATH
           - Root for accessing some special files, i.e. /dev/null,
           /etc/services.

       ROWS/COLS
           - Rows/cols for console.

       HOME
           - Home directory.

       CONSOLEFONTSIZE
           - Size for console font.

       You can set these with cereg.exe, a (remote) registry editor or via the
       PerlIDE.

   REGISTRY
       To start perl by clicking on a perl source file, you have to make the
       according entries in HKCR (see ce-helpers/wince-reg.bat).  cereg.exe
       (which must be executed on a desktop pc with ActiveSync) is reported not
       to work on some devices.  You have to create the registry entries by hand
       using a registry editor.

   XS
       The following Win32-Methods are built-in:

               newXS("Win32::GetCwd", w32_GetCwd, file);
               newXS("Win32::SetCwd", w32_SetCwd, file);
               newXS("Win32::GetTickCount", w32_GetTickCount, file);
               newXS("Win32::GetOSVersion", w32_GetOSVersion, file);
               newXS("Win32::IsWinNT", w32_IsWinNT, file);
               newXS("Win32::IsWin95", w32_IsWin95, file);
               newXS("Win32::IsWinCE", w32_IsWinCE, file);
               newXS("Win32::CopyFile", w32_CopyFile, file);
               newXS("Win32::Sleep", w32_Sleep, file);
               newXS("Win32::MessageBox", w32_MessageBox, file);
               newXS("Win32::GetPowerStatus", w32_GetPowerStatus, file);
               newXS("Win32::GetOemInfo", w32_GetOemInfo, file);
               newXS("Win32::ShellEx", w32_ShellEx, file);

   BUGS
       Opening files for read-write is currently not supported if they use stdio
       (normal perl file handles).

       If you find bugs or if it does not work at all on your device, send mail
       to the address below. Please report the details of your device
       (processor, ceversion, devicetype (hpc/palm/pocket)) and the date of the
       downloaded files.

   INSTALLATION
       Currently installation instructions are at
       <http://perlce.sourceforge.net/>.

       After installation & testing processes will stabilize, information will
       be more precise.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       The port for Win32 was used as a reference.

History of WinCE port
       5.6.0
           Initial port of perl to WinCE. It was performed in separate directory
           named wince. This port was based on contents of ./win32 directory.
           miniperl was not built, user must have HOST perl and properly edit
           makefile.ce to reflect this.

       5.8.0
           wince port was kept in the same ./wince directory, and
           wince/Makefile.ce was used to invoke native compiler to create HOST
           miniperl, which then facilitates cross-compiling process.  Extension
           building support was added.

       5.9.4
           Two directories ./win32 and ./wince were merged, so perlce build
           process comes in ./win32 directory.

AUTHORS
       Rainer Keuchel <coyxc@rainer-keuchel.de>
           provided initial port of Perl, which appears to be most essential
           work, as it was a breakthrough on having Perl ported at all.  Many
           thanks and obligations to Rainer!

       Vadim Konovalov
           made further support of WinCE port.

       Daniel Dragan
           updated the build process during the 5.19 development track.
