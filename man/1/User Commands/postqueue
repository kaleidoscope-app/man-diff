POSTQUEUE(1)                 General Commands Manual                POSTQUEUE(1)




NAME
       postqueue - Postfix queue control

SYNOPSIS
   To flush the mail queue:

       postqueue [-v] [-c config_dir] -f

       postqueue [-v] [-c config_dir] -i queue_id

       postqueue [-v] [-c config_dir] -s site

   To list the mail queue:

       postqueue [-v] [-c config_dir] -j

       postqueue [-v] [-c config_dir] -p

DESCRIPTION
       The postqueue(1) command implements the Postfix user interface for queue
       management. It implements operations that are traditionally available via
       the sendmail(1) command.  See the postsuper(1) command for queue
       operations that require super-user privileges such as deleting a message
       from the queue or changing the status of a message.

       The following options are recognized:

       -c config_dir
              The main.cf configuration file is in the named directory instead
              of the default configuration directory. See also the MAIL_CONFIG
              environment setting below.

       -f     Flush the queue: attempt to deliver all queued mail.

              This option implements the traditional "sendmail -q" command, by
              contacting the Postfix qmgr(8) daemon.

              Warning: flushing undeliverable mail frequently will result in
              poor delivery performance of all other mail.

       -i queue_id
              Schedule immediate delivery of deferred mail with the specified
              queue ID.

              This option implements the traditional sendmail -qI command, by
              contacting the flush(8) server.

              This feature is available with Postfix version 2.4 and later.

       -j     Produce a queue listing in JSON format, based on output from the
              showq(8) daemon.  The result is a stream of zero or more JSON
              objects, one per queue file.  Each object is followed by a newline
              character to support simple streaming parsers. See "JSON OBJECT
              FORMAT" below for details.

              This feature is available in Postfix 3.1 and later.

       -p     Produce a traditional sendmail-style queue listing.  This option
              implements the traditional mailq command, by contacting the
              Postfix showq(8) daemon.

              Each queue entry shows the queue file ID, message size, arrival
              time, sender, and the recipients that still need to be delivered.
              If mail could not be delivered upon the last attempt, the reason
              for failure is shown. The queue ID string is followed by an
              optional status character:

              *      The message is in the active queue, i.e. the message is
                     selected for delivery.

              !      The message is in the hold queue, i.e. no further delivery
                     attempt will be made until the mail is taken off hold.

       -s site
              Schedule immediate delivery of all mail that is queued for the
              named site. A numerical site must be specified as a valid RFC 5321
              address literal enclosed in [], just like in email addresses.  The
              site must be eligible for the "fast flush" service.  See flush(8)
              for more information about the "fast flush" service.

              This option implements the traditional "sendmail -qRsite" command,
              by contacting the Postfix flush(8) daemon.

       -v     Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple -v options
              make the software increasingly verbose. As of Postfix 2.3, this
              option is available for the super-user only.

JSON OBJECT FORMAT
       Each JSON object represents one queue file; it is emitted as a single
       text line followed by a newline character.

       Object members have string values unless indicated otherwise.  Programs
       should ignore object members that are not listed here; the list of
       members is expected to grow over time.

       queue_name
              The name of the queue where the message was found.  Note that the
              contents of the mail queue may change while it is being listed;
              some messages may appear more than once, and some messages may be
              missed.

       queue_id
              The queue file name. The queue_id may be reused within a Postfix
              instance unless "enable_long_queue_ids = true" and time is
              monotonic.  Even then, the queue_id is not expected to be unique
              between different Postfix instances.  Management tools that
              require a unique name should combine the queue_id with the
              myhostname setting of the Postfix instance.

       arrival_time
              The number of seconds since the start of the UNIX epoch.

       message_size
              The number of bytes in the message header and body. This number
              does not include message envelope information. It is approximately
              equal to the number of bytes that would be transmitted via SMTP
              including the <CR><LF> line endings.

       sender The envelope sender address.

       recipients
              An array containing zero or more objects with members:

              address
                     One recipient address.

              delay_reason
                     If present, the reason for delayed delivery.  Delayed
                     recipients may have no delay reason, for example, while
                     delivery is in progress, or after the system was stopped
                     before it could record the reason.

SECURITY
       This program is designed to run with set-group ID privileges, so that it
       can connect to Postfix daemon processes.

STANDARDS
       RFC 7159 (JSON notation)

DIAGNOSTICS
       Problems are logged to syslogd(8) and to the standard error stream.

ENVIRONMENT

       MAIL_CONFIG
              Directory with the main.cf file. In order to avoid exploitation of
              set-group ID privileges, a non-standard directory is allowed only
              if:

              •      The name is listed in the standard main.cf file with the
                     alternate_config_directories configuration parameter.

              •      The command is invoked by the super-user.

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
       The following main.cf parameters are especially relevant to this program.

       more details including examples.

       alternate_config_directories (empty)
              A list of non-default Postfix configuration directories that may
              be specified with "-c config_directory" on the command line (in
              the case of sendmail(1), with "-C config_directory"), or via the
              MAIL_CONFIG environment parameter.

       config_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)
              The default location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf
              configuration files.

              The location of all postfix administrative commands.

       fast_flush_domains ($relay_domains)
              Optional list of destinations that are eligible for
              per-destination logfiles with mail that is queued to those
              destinations.

       import_environment (see 'postconf -d' output)
              The list of environment parameters that a Postfix process will

              A prefix that is prepended to the process name in syslog records,
              so that, for example, "smtpd" becomes "prefix/smtpd".

       trigger_timeout (10s)
              The time limit for sending a trigger to a Postfix daemon (for
              example, the pickup(8) or qmgr(8) daemon).
