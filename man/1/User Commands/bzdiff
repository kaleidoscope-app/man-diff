BZDIFF(1)                    General Commands Manual                   BZDIFF(1)






NAME
       bzcmp, bzdiff - compare bzip2 compressed files

SYNOPSIS
       bzcmp [ cmp_options ] file1 [ file2 ]
       bzdiff [ diff_options ] file1 [ file2 ]

DESCRIPTION
       Bzcmp and bzdiff are used to invoke the cmp or the diff program on bzip2
       compressed files.  All options specified are passed directly to cmp or
       diff.  If only 1 file is specified, then the files compared are file1 and
       an uncompressed file1.bz2.  If two files are specified, then they are
       uncompressed if necessary and fed to cmp or diff.  The exit status from
       cmp or diff is preserved.

SEE ALSO
       cmp(1), diff(1), bzmore(1), bzless(1), bzgrep(1), bzip2(1)

BUGS
       Messages from the cmp or diff programs refer to temporary filenames
       instead of those specified.
