NAME
       perl5123delta - what is new for perl v5.12.3

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes differences between the 5.12.2 release and the
       5.12.3 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.12.1, first read
       perl5122delta, which describes differences between 5.12.1 and 5.12.2.
       The major changes made in 5.12.0 are described in perl5120delta.

Incompatible Changes
           There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.12.2. If any
           exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.

Core Enhancements
   "keys", "values" work on arrays
       You can now use the "keys", "values", "each" builtin functions on arrays
       (previously you could only use them on hashes).  See perlfunc for
       details.  This is actually a change introduced in perl 5.12.0, but it was
       missed from that release's perldelta.

Bug Fixes
       "no VERSION" will now correctly deparse with B::Deparse, as will certain
       constant expressions.

       Module::Build should be more reliably pass its tests under cygwin.

       Lvalue subroutines are again able to return copy-on-write scalars.  This
       had been broken since version 5.10.0.

Platform Specific Notes
       Solaris
           A separate DTrace is now build for miniperl, which means that perl
           can be compiled with -Dusedtrace on Solaris again.

       VMS A number of regressions on VMS have been fixed.  In addition to minor
           cleanup of questionable expressions in vms.c, file permissions should
           no longer be garbled by the PerlIO layer, and spurious record
           boundaries should no longer be introduced by the PerlIO layer during
           output.

           For more details and discussion on the latter, see:

               http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.vmsperl/2010/11/msg15419.html

       VOS A few very small changes were made to the build process on VOS to
           better support the platform.  Longer-than-32-character filenames are
           now supported on OpenVOS, and build properly without IPv6 support.

Acknowledgements
       Perl 5.12.3 represents approximately four months of development since
       Perl 5.12.2 and contains approximately 2500 lines of changes across 54
       files from 16 authors.

       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant
       community of users and developers.  The following people are known to
       have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.12.3:

       Craig A. Berry, David Golden, David Leadbeater, Father Chrysostomos,
       Florian Ragwitz, Jesse Vincent, Karl Williamson, Nick Johnston, Nicolas
       Kaiser, Paul Green, Rafael Garcia-Suarez, Rainer Tammer, Ricardo Signes,
       Steffen Mueller, Zsban Ambrus, AEvar Arnfjoer` Bjarmason

Reporting Bugs
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
       recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
       database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be information
       at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
       included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
       sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of "perl
       -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
       porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
       send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
       committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure
       out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate
       or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported.
       Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl core, not
       for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
