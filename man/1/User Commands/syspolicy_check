SYSPOLICY_CHECK(1)           General Commands Manual          SYSPOLICY_CHECK(1)

NAME
     syspolicy_check â€“ Check if macOS app is ready for notarization or
     distribution

SYNOPSIS
     syspolicy_check notary-submission path [--verbose] [--json]
     syspolicy_check distribution path [--verbose] [--json]
     syspolicy_check [notary-submission | distribution] --help



DESCRIPTION
     syspolicy_check is used to check whether macOS application bundles are
     ready for upload to the Apple notary service, or ready for distribution to
     users outside of the Mac App Store.

     syspolicy_check combines checks from multiple parts of macOS, including the
     frameworks and subsystems exposed by the existing codesign, spctl, and
     stapler commands.


     syspolicy_check requires exactly one subcommand option to determine what
     action is to be performed. You can also pass -v or --verbose up to 3 times
     to get increasingly verbose output. --json outputs any errors to stdout in
     json format.


SUBCOMMANDS
     The subcommands are as follows:

     notary-submission
             Runs the same checks on an app as the Apple notary service, to make
             sure the app is ready for uploading to the service.

             Notarization gives users more confidence that the Developer ID-
             signed software you distribute has been checked by Apple for
             malicious components. Notarization is not App Review. The Apple
             notary service is an automated system that scans your software for
             malicious content, checks for code-signing issues, and returns the
             results to you quickly. If there are no issues, the notary service
             generates a ticket for you to staple to your software; the notary
             service also publishes that ticket online where Gatekeeper can find
             it.

     distribution
             Runs the same checks on your app as macOS does when determining if
             your app can be executed. This includes Gatekeeper checks, XProtect
             checks, provisioning profile checks, and more.
