NAME
       logresolve - Resolve IP-addresses to hostnames in Apache log files


SYNOPSIS
       logresolve [ -s filename ] [ -c ] < access_log > access_log.new



SUMMARY
       logresolve is a post-processing program to resolve IP-addresses in
       Apache's access logfiles. To minimize impact on your nameserver,
       logresolve has its very own internal hash-table cache. This means that
       each IP number will only be looked up the first time it is found in the
       log file.


       Takes an Apache log file on standard input. The IP addresses must be the
       first thing on each line and must be separated from the remainder of the
       line by a space.



OPTIONS
       -s filename
              Specifies a filename to record statistics.

       -c     This causes logresolve to apply some DNS checks: after finding the
              hostname from the IP address, it looks up the IP addresses for the
              hostname and checks that one of these matches the original
              address.
