NAME
       bzmore, bzless - file perusal filter for crt viewing of bzip2 compressed
       text

SYNOPSIS
       bzmore [ name ...  ]
       bzless [ name ...  ]

NOTE
       In the following description, bzless and less can be used interchangeably
       with bzmore and more.

DESCRIPTION
       Bzmore is a filter which allows examination of compressed or plain text
       files one screenful at a time on a soft-copy terminal.  bzmore works on
       files compressed with bzip2 and also on uncompressed files.  If a file
       does not exist, bzmore looks for a file of the same name with the
       addition of a .bz2 suffix.

       Bzmore normally pauses after each screenful, printing --More-- at the
       bottom of the screen.  If the user then types a carriage return, one more
       line is displayed.  If the user hits a space, another screenful is
       displayed.  Other possibilities are enumerated later.

       Bzmore looks in the file /etc/termcap to determine terminal
       characteristics, and to determine the default window size.  On a terminal
       capable of displaying 24 lines, the default window size is 22 lines.
       Other sequences which may be typed when bzmore pauses, and their effects,
       are as follows (i is an optional integer argument, defaulting to 1) :

       i<space>
              display i more lines, (or another screenful if no argument is
              given)

       ^D     display 11 more lines (a ``scroll'').  If i is given, then the
              scroll size is set to i.

       d      same as ^D (control-D)

       iz     same as typing a space except that i, if present, becomes the new
              window size.  Note that the window size reverts back to the
              default at the end of the current file.

       is     skip i lines and print a screenful of lines

       if     skip i screenfuls and print a screenful of lines

       q or Q quit reading the current file; go on to the next (if any)

       e or q When the prompt --More--(Next file: file) is printed, this command
              causes bzmore to exit.

       s      When the prompt --More--(Next file: file) is printed, this command
              causes bzmore to skip the next file and continue.

       =      Display the current line number.

       i/expr search for the i-th occurrence of the regular expression expr. If
              the pattern is not found, bzmore goes on to the next file (if
              any).  Otherwise, a screenful is displayed, starting two lines
              before the place where the expression was found.  The user's erase
              and kill characters may be used to edit the regular expression.
              Erasing back past the first column cancels the search command.

       in     search for the i-th occurrence of the last regular expression
              entered.

       !command
              invoke a shell with command.  The character `!' in "command" are
              replaced with the previous shell command.  The sequence "\!" is
              replaced by "!".

       :q or :Q
              quit reading the current file; go on to the next (if any) (same as
              q or Q).

       .      (dot) repeat the previous command.

       The commands take effect immediately, i.e., it is not necessary to type a
       carriage return.  Up to the time when the command character itself is
       given, the user may hit the line kill character to cancel the numerical
       argument being formed.  In addition, the user may hit the erase character
       to redisplay the --More-- message.

       At any time when output is being sent to the terminal, the user can hit
       the quit key (normally control-\).  Bzmore will stop sending output, and
       will display the usual --More-- prompt.  The user may then enter one of
       the above commands in the normal manner.  Unfortunately, some output is
       lost when this is done, due to the fact that any characters waiting in
       the terminal's output queue are flushed when the quit signal occurs.

       The terminal is set to noecho mode by this program so that the output can
       be continuous.  What you type will thus not show on your terminal, except
       for the / and !  commands.

       If the standard output is not a teletype, then bzmore acts just like
       bzcat, except that a header is printed before each file.
