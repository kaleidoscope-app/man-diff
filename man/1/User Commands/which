WHICH(1)                     General Commands Manual                    WHICH(1)

NAME
     which â€“ locate a program file in the user's path

SYNOPSIS
     which [-as] program ...

DESCRIPTION
     The which utility takes a list of command names and searches the path for
     each executable file that would be run had these commands actually been
     invoked.

     The following options are available:

     -a      List all instances of executables found (instead of just the first
             one of each).

     -s      No output, just return 0 if all of the executables are found, or 1
             if some were not found.

     Some shells may provide a builtin which command which is similar or
     identical to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.
