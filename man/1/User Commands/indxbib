INDXBIB(1)                   General Commands Manual                  INDXBIB(1)



NAME
       indxbib - make inverted index for bibliographic databases

SYNOPSIS
indxbib [ -vw ] [ -cfile ] [ -ddir ] [ -ffile ] [ -hn ] [ -istring ] [ -kn ]
               [ -ln ] [ -nn ] [ -ofile ] [ -tn ] [ filename... ]

       It is possible to have whitespace between a command line option and its
       parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       indxbib makes an inverted index for the bibliographic databases in
       filename...  for use with refer(1), lookbib(1), and lkbib(1).  The index
       will be named filename.i; the index is written to a temporary file which
       is then renamed to this.  If no filenames are given on the command line
       because the -f option has been used, and no -o option is given, the index
       will be named Ind.i.

       Bibliographic databases are divided into records by blank lines.  Within
       a record, each fields starts with a % character at the beginning of a
       line.  Fields have a one letter name which follows the % character.

       The values set by the -c, -n, -l and -t options are stored in the index;
       when the index is searched, keys will be discarded and truncated in a
       manner appropriate to these options; the original keys will be used for
       verifying that any record found using the index actually contains the
       keys.  This means that a user of an index need not know whether these
       options were used in the creation of the index, provided that not all the
       keys to be searched for would have been discarded during indexing and
       that the user supplies at least the part of each key that would have
       remained after being truncated during indexing.  The value set by the -i
       option is also stored in the index and will be used in verifying records
       found using the index.

OPTIONS
       -v     Print the version number.

       -w     Index whole files.  Each file is a separate record.

       -cfile Read the list of common words from file instead of
              /usr/share/groff/1.19.2/eign.

       -ddir  Use dir as the pathname of the current working directory to store
              in the index, instead of the path printed by pwd(1).  Usually dir
              will be a symbolic link that points to the directory printed by
              pwd(1).

       -ffile Read the files to be indexed from file.  If file is -, files will
              be read from the standard input.  The -f option can be given at
              most once.

       -istring
              Don't index the contents of fields whose names are in string.
              Initially string is XYZ.

       -hn    Use the first prime greater than or equal to n for the size of the
              hash table.  Larger values of n will usually make searching
              faster, but will make the index larger and indxbib use more
              memory.  Initially n is 997.

       -kn    Use at most n keys per input record.  Initially n is 100.

       -ln    Discard keys that are shorter than n.  Initially n is 3.

       -nn    Discard the n most common words.  Initially n is 100.

       -obasename
              The index should be named basename.i.

       -tn    Truncate keys to n.  Initially n is 6.

FILES
       filename.i   Index.

       Ind.i        Default index name.

       /usr/share/groff/1.19.2/eign
                    List of common words.

       indxbibXXXXXX
                    Temporary file.
