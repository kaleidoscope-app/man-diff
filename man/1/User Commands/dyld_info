NAME
     dyld_info â€“ Displays information used by dyld in programs and dylibs

SYNOPSIS
     dyld_info [-arch arch-name] [-platform] [-segments] [-dependents] [-inits]
               [-exports] [-imports] [-objc] [-fixups] [-fixup_chains]
               [-fixup_chain_details] [-symbolic_fixups] [-validate_only]
               file(s)

DESCRIPTION
     The dyld_info tool will display information that dyld uses from binaries.
     It supports fixups information encoded as opcode based or as chained
     fixups.

     If the tool is run with no options, it defaults to the common options
     (-platform -segments -dependents).

     The tool can be run with paths to dylibs that are in the dyld cache and not
     on disk.

     The options are as follows:

     -arch arch
             Only display the specified architecture.  Other architectures in a
             universal image are ignored.

     -platform
             Display the platform (e.g. macOS, iOS) that the binary was built
             for.

     -segments
             Display all segments and sections with size info.

     -dependents
             Display all dylibs that the binary is linked against.

     -inits  Display all static initializers and Objective-C +load methods.

     -exports
             Display all exported symbols.

     -imports
             Display all imported symbols.

     -objc   Display the Objective-C classes and categories defined.

     -fixups
             Display a simple table of fixup locations and what dyld will set
             them to.

     -fixup_chains
             If the binary uses chained fixups, displays the format of the
             chains and the starts.

     -fixup_chain_details
             Display a table of all the raw fixup chain bits and their meanings.

     -symbolic_fixups
             Display all fixups, grouped by data symbol.

     -validate_only
             Display nothing if binary is valid, or information about what parts
             are malformed.
