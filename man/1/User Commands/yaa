ENTRY SELECTION
       -include-path and -include-path-list options are applied first to select
       an initial set of entries, then -exclude-path, -exclude-path-list,
       -exclude-name, -exclude-regex are applied to remove entries from this
       set.  If no -include-path or -include-path-list option is given, all
       entries are included in the initial set.  If a directory is
       included/excluded, the entire sub-tree is included/excluded.

EXAMPLES
       Archive the contents of directory foo into archive foo.aar, using LZMA
       compression with 8 MB blocks

              aa archive -d foo -o foo.aar -a lzma -b 8m

       Extract the contents of foo.aar in directory dst

              aa extract -d dst -i foo.aar

       Create a manifest of the contents of directory foo into foo.manifest,
       using LZFSE compression with 1 MB blocks

              aa manifest -d foo -o foo.manifest -a lzfse -b 1m

       Verify the contents of dst match the manifest foo.manifest

              aa verify -i foo.manifest -d dst -v

       Print all entry paths in foo.manifest

              aa list -i foo.manifest

       Print all entry paths, uid, gid for regular files in foo.manifest

              aa list -v -i foo.manifest -include-type f -exclude-field all
              -include-field uid,gid,pat

       Create a manifest of the contents of archive foo.aar in foo.manifest

              aa convert -manifest -v -i foo.aar -o foo.manifest

       Extract a subset of entries matching prefix Applications/Mail.app from
       archive foo.aar in directory dst

              aa extract -i foo.aar -include-path Applications/Mail.app -d dst
