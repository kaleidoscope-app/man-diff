NAME
       dapptrace - trace user and library function usage. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       dapptrace [-acdeFlhoU] [-u lib] { -p PID | command }

DESCRIPTION
       dapptrace prints details on user and library function calls. By default
       it traces user functions only, options can be used to trace library
       activity.

       Of particular interest is the elapsed times and on cpu times, which can
       identify both function calls that are slow to complete, and those which
       are consuming CPU cycles.

       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

OPTIONS
       -a     print all details

       -b bufsize
              dynamic variable buffer size. Increase this if you notice dynamic
              variable drop errors. The default is "4m" for 4 megabytes per CPU.

       -c     print function call counts

       -d     print relative timestamps, us

       -e     print elapsed times, us

       -F     print flow indentation

       -l     force printing of pid/lwpid per line

       -o     print on-cpu times, us

       -p PID examine this PID

       -u lib trace this library instead

       -U     trace all library and user functions

EXAMPLES
       run and examine the "df -h" command,
              # dapptrace df -h

       examine PID 1871,
              # dapptrace -p 1871

       print using flow indents,
              # dapptrace -Fp 1871

       print elapsed and CPU times,
              # dapptrace -eop 1871

FIELDS
       PID/LWPID
              Process ID / Lightweight Process ID

       RELATIVE
              relative timestamps to the start of the thread, us (microseconds)

       ELAPSD elapsed time for this system call, us

       CPU    on-cpu time for this system call, us

       CALL(args)
              function call name, with some arguments in hexadecimal

DOCUMENTATION
       See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs directory.
       The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with verbose
       descriptions explaining the output.

EXIT
       dapptrace will run forever until Ctrl-C is hit, or if a command was
       executed dapptrace will finish when the command ends.
