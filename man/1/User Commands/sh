NAME
     sh â€“ POSIX-compliant command interpreter

SYNOPSIS
     sh [options]

DESCRIPTION
     sh is a POSIX-compliant command interpreter (shell).  It is implemented by
     re-execing as either bash(1), dash(1), or zsh(1) as determined by the
     symbolic link located at /private/var/select/sh.  If /private/var/select/sh
     does not exist or does not point to a valid shell, sh will use one of the
     supported shells.

FILES
