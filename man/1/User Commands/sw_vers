NAME
     sw_vers â€“ print macOS version information

SYNOPSIS
     sw_vers
     sw_vers -productName
     sw_vers -productVersion
     sw_vers -buildVersion

DESCRIPTION
     sw_vers prints macOS version information for the currently running
     operating system on the local machine.

     When executed with no options sw_vers prints a short list of version
     properties:

           % sw_vers
           ProductName:    macOS
           ProductVersion: 12.0
           BuildVersion:   21A100

     The ProductName property provides the name of the operating system release
     (typically "macOS").  The ProductVersion property defines the version of
     the operating system release (for example, "11.3" or "12.0").  The
     BuildVersion property provides the specific revision of the operating
     system as generated by the macOS build system.

     form options are case-insensitive.

     -productName     Print only the value of the ProductName property.

     -productVersion  Print only the value of the ProductVersion property.

     -buildVersion    Print only the value of the BuildVersion property.
