SW_VERS(1)                   General Commands Manual                  SW_VERS(1)

NAME
     sw_vers â€“ print macOS system version information

SYNOPSIS
     sw_vers
     sw_vers --productName
     sw_vers --productVersion
     sw_vers --productVersionExtra
     sw_vers --buildVersion

DESCRIPTION
     sw_vers prints macOS version information for the currently running
     operating system on the local machine.

     When executed with no options sw_vers prints a short list of version
     properties:

           % sw_vers
           ProductName:              macOS
           ProductVersion:           13.0
           ProductVersionExtra:      (a)
           BuildVersion:             22A100

     The ProductName property provides the name of the operating system release
     (typically "macOS"). The ProductVersion property defines the version of the
     operating system release (for example, "11.3" or "12.0"). The
     ProductVersionExtra property defines the Rapid Security Response version,
     if one is installed on the operating system (for example, "(a)" or "(b)").
     The BuildVersion property provides the specific revision of the operating
     system as generated by the macOS build system.

OPTIONS
     The output of sw_vers can be refined by the following options. These long-
     form options can also be passed in lowercase for convenience.

     --productName          Print only the value of the ProductName property.

     --productVersion       Print only the value of the ProductVersion property.

     --productVersionExtra  Print only the value of the ProductVersionExtra
                            property.

     --buildVersion         Print only the value of the BuildVersion property.

EXAMPLES
     % sw_vers --productName
     macOS

     % sw_vers --productVersion
     13.0

     % sw_vers --productVersionExtra
     (a)

     % sw_vers --buildVersion
     22A100

COMPATIBILITY
     Previous versions of sw_vers respected the SYSTEM_VERSION_COMPAT
     environment variable to provide compatibility fallback versions for scripts
     which did not support the macOS 11.0+ version transition. This is no longer
     supported, versions returned by sw_vers will always reflect the real system
     version.

     sw_vers is backwards compatible with previous versions which expect options
     passed with a single dash, as in:

     -productName
