PLUTIL(1)                    General Commands Manual                   PLUTIL(1)

NAME
     plutil â€“ property list utility

SYNOPSIS
     plutil [command_option] [other_options] file
             ...

DESCRIPTION
     plutil can be used to check the syntax of property list files, or convert a
     plist file from one format to another.  Specifying - as an input file reads
     from stdin.

     The first argument indicates the operation to perform, one of:

     -help         Show the usage information for the command and exit.

     -p            Print the property list in a human-readable fashion. The
                   output format is not stable and not designed for machine
                   parsing. The purpose of this command is to be able to easily
                   read the contents of a plist file, no matter what format it
                   is in.

     -lint         Check the named property list files for syntax errors.  This
                   is the default command option if none is specified.

     -convert fmt  Convert the named file to the indicated format and write back
                   to the file system.  If the file can't be loaded due to
                   invalid syntax, the operation fails. This is the only option
                   to support objc swift formats.

     -convert objc -header
                   Converts the named file to Obj-C literal syntax and creates a
                   .h file. Useful for first time conversions to literal syntax
                   and only supported with the objc format.

     -insert keypath -type value
                   Insert a value into the property list before writing it out.

     -replace keypath -type value
                   Overwrite an existing value in the property list before
                   writing it out.

     -remove keypath
                   Removes the value at keypath from the property list before
                   writing it out.

     -extract keypath fmt
                   Outputs the value at keypath in the property list as a new
                   plist of type fmt.

     There are a few additional options:

     --            Specifies that all further arguments are file names

     -s            Don't print anything on success.

     -r            For JSON, add whitespace and indentation to make the output
                   more human-readable and sort the keys like -p, does.

     -o path       Specify an alternate path name for the result of the -convert
                   operation; this option is only useful with a single file to
                   be converted.  Specifying - as the path outputs to stdout.

     -e extension  Specify an alternate extension for converted files, and the
                   output file names are otherwise the same.

ARGUMENTS
     fmt is one of:
           xml1     for version 1 of the XML plist format
           binary1  for version 1 of the binary plist format
           json     for the JSON format
           swift    to convert from plist to swift literal syntax
           objc     to convert from plist to Obj-C literal syntax

     keypath is a key-value coding key path, with one extension: a numerical
     path component applied to an array will act on the object at that index in
     the array or insert it into the array if the numerical path component is
     the last one in the key path.

     type is one of:
            -bool     YES if passed "YES" or "true", otherwise NO
            -integer  any valid 64 bit integer
            -float    any valid 64 bit float
            -string   UTF8 encoded string
            -date     date in XML property list format, not supported if
                      outputting JSON
            -data     a base-64 encoded string
            -xml      an XML property list, useful for inserting compound values
            -json     JSON fragment, useful for inserting compound values

     value will be assigned to the keypath specified with the -insert or
     -replace flags.
