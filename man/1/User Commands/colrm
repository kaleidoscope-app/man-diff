COLRM(1)                     General Commands Manual                    COLRM(1)

NAME
     colrm â€“ remove columns from a file

SYNOPSIS
     colrm [start [stop]]

DESCRIPTION
     The colrm utility removes selected columns from the lines of a file.  A
     column is defined as a single character in a line.  Input is read from the
     standard input.  Output is written to the standard output.

     If only the start column is specified, columns numbered less than the start
     column will be written.  If both start and stop columns are specified,
     columns numbered less than the start column or greater than the stop column
     will be written.  Column numbering starts with one, not zero.

     Tab characters increment the column count to the next multiple of eight.
     Backspace characters decrement the column count by one.

ENVIRONMENT
     The LANG, LC_ALL and LC_CTYPE environment variables affect the execution of
     colrm as described in environ(7).

EXIT STATUS
     The colrm utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Show columns below 3 (c) and above 5 (e):

           $ echo -e "abcdefgh\n12345678" | colrm 3 5
           abfgh
           12678

     Specifying a start column bigger than the number of columns in the file is
     allowed and shows all the columns:

           $ echo "abcdefgh" | colrm 100
           abcdefgh

     Using 1 as start column will show nothing:

           $ echo "abcdefgh" | colrm 1


SEE ALSO
     awk(1), column(1), cut(1), paste(1)
