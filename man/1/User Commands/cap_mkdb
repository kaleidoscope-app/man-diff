CAP_MKDB(1)                  General Commands Manual                 CAP_MKDB(1)

NAME
     cap_mkdb – create capability database


SYNOPSIS
     cap_mkdb [-v] [-f outfile] file1 [file2 ...]

DESCRIPTION
     Cap_mkdb builds a hashed database out of the getcap(3) logical database
     constructed by the concatenation of the specified files .

     The database is named by the basename of the first file argument and the
     string “.db”.  The getcap(3) routines can access the database in this form
     much more quickly than they can the original text file(s).

     The ``tc'' capabilities of the records are expanded before the record is
     stored into the database.

     The options as as follows:

     -f outfile
             Specify a different database basename.

     -v      Print out the number of capability records in the database.

FORMAT
     Each record is stored in the database using two different types of keys.

     The first type is a key which consists of the first capability of the
     record (not including the trailing colon (``:'')) with a data field
     consisting of a special byte followed by the rest of the record.  The
     special byte is either a 0 or 1, where a 0 means that the record is okay,
     and a 1 means that there was a ``tc'' capability in the record that
     couldn't be expanded.

     The second type is a key which consists of one of the names from the first
     capability of the record with a data field consisting a special byte
     followed by the the first capability of the record.  The special byte is a
     2.

     In normal operation names are looked up in the database, resulting in a
     key/data pair of the second type.  The data field of this key/data pair is
     used to look up a key/data pair of the first type which has the real data
     associated with the name.

RETURN VALUE
     The cap_mkdb utility exits 0 on success and >0 if an error occurs.
