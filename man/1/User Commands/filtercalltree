filtercalltree(1)            General Commands Manual           filtercalltree(1)

NAME
     filtercalltree â€“ Filter or prune a call tree file generated by sample or
     malloc_history

SYNOPSIS
     filtercalltree call-tree-file [-invertCallTree] [-pruneCount count]
                    [-pruneMallocSize size] [-chargeSystemLibraries]
                    [-chargeLibrary libraryName] [-keepBoundaries]

DESCRIPTION
     filtercalltree reads a file containing a call tree, as generated by the
     sample(1) or malloc_history(1) commands, and filters or prunes it as
     specified by the options.

OPTIONS
     -invertCallTree         Print the call tree from hottest to coldest stack
                             frame.

     -pruneCount count       Remove branches of the call tree that have count
                             less than count

     -pruneMallocSize size   Remove branches of the call tree that have malloc
                             size less than size, such as 500K or 1.2M.

     -chargeSystemLibraries  Remove stack frames from all libraries in /System
                             and /usr, while still charging their cost to the
                             caller.

     -chargeLibrary library-name
                             Remove stack frames from library-name, while still
                             charging their cost to the caller.  This argument
                             can be repeated for multiple libraries.

     -keepBoundaries         When charging libraries to callers, keep the top
                             call into excluded libraries.
