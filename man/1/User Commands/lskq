LSKQ(1)                      General Commands Manual                     LSKQ(1)

NAME
     lskq â€“ display process kqueue state

SYNOPSIS
     lskq [-vhe] [-p <pid> | -a]

DESCRIPTION
     The lskq command enumerates kqueues and registered kevents of running
     processes.

OPTIONS
     -p <pid>
          Show kqueues of process <pid>.

     -a   Show kqueues for all running processes.  Requires root.

     -v   Verbose: show opaque user data and filter-specific extension fields.

     -e   Ignore empty kqueues.

     -r   Print fields in raw hex.

     -h   Show help and exit.

OUTPUT
     lskq prints one line of output for each registered kevent, consisting of
     process, kqueue, and kevent information.  For kqueues with no registered
     kevents, a single line is output with an ident of `-'.  See kevent(2) for
     field semantics.  The output columns are:

     command       shortened process name.

     pid           process identifier.

     kq            file descriptor corresponding to kqueue, or ``wq'' for the
                   special workq kqueue.

     kqst          kqueue status bitmask.
                   k        kqueue is in a kevent*() wait set (KQ_SLEEP).
                   s        kqueue is in a select() wait set (KQ_SEL).
                   3 6 q    Type of kevents on this kqueue: KEV32, KEV64, or
                            KEV_QOS.

     ident         kevent identifier.  The meaning depends on the kevent filter
                   specified.  Where possible, lskq prints both numeric and
                   symbolic names.

     filter        kevent filter type (EVFILT_*).

     fdtype        file descriptor type, for filters operating on file
                   descriptors.

     fflags        kevent filter flags bitmask.  The meaning of each field
                   depends on the filter type.

     data          Filter-specific data.

     If the -v (verbose) option is specified, the opaque user-data field and
     further filter-specific extension fields are printed in raw hexadecimal.

NOTES
     The output of lskq is not an atomic snapshot of system state.  In cases
     where lskq is able to detect an inconsistency, a warning will be printed.

     Not all flags are symbolicated.  Use -r (raw mode) to inspect additional
     flags.
