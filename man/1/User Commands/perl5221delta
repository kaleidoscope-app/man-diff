NAME
       perl5221delta - what is new for perl v5.22.1

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes differences between the 5.22.0 release and the
       5.22.1 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.20.0, first read
       perl5220delta, which describes differences between 5.20.0 and 5.22.0.

Incompatible Changes
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.20.0 other than
       the following single exception, which we deemed to be a sensible change
       to make in order to get the new "\b{wb}" and (in particular) "\b{sb}"
       features sane before people decided they're worthless because of bugs in
       their Perl 5.22.0 implementation and avoided them in the future.  If any
       others exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report.
       See "Reporting Bugs" below.

   Bounds Checking Constructs
       Several bugs, including a segmentation fault, have been fixed with the
       bounds checking constructs (introduced in Perl 5.22) "\b{gcb}", "\b{sb}",
       "\b{wb}", "\B{gcb}", "\B{sb}", and "\B{wb}".  All the "\B{}" ones now
       match an empty string; none of the "\b{}" ones do.  [perl #126319]
       <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126319>

Modules and Pragmata
   Updated Modules and Pragmata
       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 5.20150520 to
           5.20151213.

       •   PerlIO::scalar has been upgraded from version 0.22 to 0.23.

       •   POSIX has been upgraded from version 1.53 to 1.53_01.

           If "POSIX::strerror" was passed $! as its argument then it
           accidentally cleared $!.  This has been fixed.  [perl #126229]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126229>

       •   Storable has been upgraded from version 2.53 to 2.53_01.

       •   warnings has been upgraded from version 1.32 to 1.34.

           The "warnings::enabled" example now actually uses
           "warnings::enabled".  [perl #126051]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126051>

       •   Win32 has been upgraded from version 0.51 to 0.52.

           This has been updated for Windows 8.1, 10 and 2012 R2 Server.

Documentation
   Changes to Existing Documentation
       perltie

       •   The usage of "FIRSTKEY" and "NEXTKEY" has been clarified.

       perlvar

       •   The specific true value of $!{E...} is now documented, noting that it
           is subject to change and not guaranteed.

Diagnostics
       The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic output,
       including warnings and fatal error messages.  For the complete list of
       diagnostic messages, see perldiag.

   Changes to Existing Diagnostics
       •   The "printf" and "sprintf" builtins are now more careful about the
           warnings they emit: argument reordering now disables the "redundant
           argument" warning in all cases.  [perl #125469]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125469>

Configuration and Compilation
       •   Using the "NO_HASH_SEED" define in combination with the default hash
           algorithm "PERL_HASH_FUNC_ONE_AT_A_TIME_HARD" resulted in a fatal
           error while compiling the interpreter, since Perl 5.17.10.  This has
           been fixed.

       •   Configuring with ccflags containing quotes (e.g.
           "-Accflags='-DAPPLLIB_EXP=\"/usr/libperl\"'") was broken in Perl
           5.22.0 but has now been fixed again.  [perl #125314]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125314>

Platform Support
   Platform-Specific Notes
       IRIX
           •   Under some circumstances IRIX stdio fgetc() and fread() set the
               errno to "ENOENT", which made no sense according to either IRIX
               or POSIX docs.  Errno is now cleared in such cases.  [perl
               #123977] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123977>

           •   Problems when multiplying long doubles by infinity have been
               fixed.  [perl #126396]
               <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126396>

           •   All tests pass now on IRIX with the default build configuration.

Selected Bug Fixes
       •   "qr/(?[ () ])/" no longer segfaults, giving a syntax error message
           instead.  [perl #125805]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125805>

       •   Regular expression possessive quantifier Perl 5.20 regression now
           fixed.  "qr/"PAT"{"min,max"}+""/" is supposed to behave identically
           to "qr/(?>"PAT"{"min,max"})/".  Since Perl 5.20, this didn't work if
           min and max were equal.  [perl #125825]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125825>

       •   Certain syntax errors in "Extended Bracketed Character Classes" in
           perlrecharclass caused panics instead of the proper error message.
           This has now been fixed.  [perl #126481]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126481>

       •   "BEGIN <>" no longer segfaults and properly produces an error
           message.  [perl #125341]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125341>

       •   A regression from Perl 5.20 has been fixed, in which some syntax
           errors in "(?[...])" constructs within regular expression patterns
           could cause a segfault instead of a proper error message.  [perl
           #126180] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126180>

       •   Another problem with "(?[...])" constructs has been fixed wherein
           things like "\c]" could cause panics.  [perl #126181]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126181>

       •   In Perl 5.22.0, the logic changed when parsing a numeric parameter to
           the -C option, such that the successfully parsed number was not saved
           as the option value if it parsed to the end of the argument.  [perl
           #125381] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125381>

       •   Warning fatality is now ignored when rewinding the stack.  This
           prevents infinite recursion when the now fatal error also causes
           rewinding of the stack.  [perl #123398]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123398>

       •   A crash with "%::=(); J->${\"::"}" has been fixed.  [perl #125541]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125541>

       •   Nested quantifiers such as "/.{1}??/" should cause perl to throw a
           fatal error, but were being silently accepted since Perl 5.20.0.
           This has been fixed.  [perl #126253]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126253>

       •   Regular expression sequences such as "/(?i/" (and similarly with
           other recognized flags or combination of flags) should cause perl to
           throw a fatal error, but were being silently accepted since Perl
           5.18.0.  This has been fixed.  [perl #126178]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126178>

       •   A bug in hexadecimal floating point literal support meant that high-
           order bits could be lost in cases where mantissa overflow was caused
           by too many trailing zeros in the fractional part.  This has been
           fixed.  [perl #126582]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126582>

       •   Another hexadecimal floating point bug, causing low-order bits to be
           lost in cases where the last hexadecimal digit of the mantissa has
           bits straddling the limit of the number of bits allowed for the
           mantissa, has also been fixed.  [perl #126586]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126586>

       •   Further hexadecimal floating point bugs have been fixed: In some
           circumstances, the %a format specifier could variously lose the sign
           of the negative zero, fail to display zeros after the radix point
           with the requested precision, or even lose the radix point after the
           leftmost hexadecimal digit completely.

       •   A crash caused by incomplete expressions within "/(?[ ])/" (e.g.
           "/(?[[0]+()+])/") has been fixed.  [perl #126615]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126615>

       5.22.0 and contains approximately 19,000 lines of changes across 130
       files from 27 authors.

       Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there
       were approximately 1,700 lines of changes to 44 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant
       community of users and developers.  The following people are known to
       have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.22.1:

       Aaron Crane, Abigail, Andy Broad, Aristotle Pagaltzis, Chase Whitener,
       Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Craig A. Berry, Daniel Dragan, David Mitchell,

       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
       generated from version control history.  In particular, it does not
       include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
       modules included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN
       community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please

Reporting Bugs
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
       recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
       database at https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
       http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
       included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
       sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of "perl
       -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
       porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
       send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed
       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
       committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure
       out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate
       or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported.
       Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl core, not
       for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
