DESCRIPTION
       ldapmodrdn is a shell-accessible interface to the ldap_rename(3) library
       call.

       ldapmodrdn opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds, and modifies the
       RDN of entries.  The entry information is read from standard input, from
       file through the use of the -f option, or from the command-line pair dn
       and rdn.

OPTIONS
       -r     Remove old RDN values from the entry.  Default is to keep old
              values.

       -s_newsup
              Specify a new superior entry. (I.e., move the target entry and
              make it a child of the new superior.)  This option is not
              supported in LDAPv2.

       -n     Show what would be done, but don't actually change entries.
              Useful for debugging in conjunction with -v.

       -v     Use verbose mode, with many diagnostics written to standard
              output.

       -c     Continuous operation mode.  Errors  are  reported,  but ldapmodrdn
              will  continue  with  modifications.   The default is to exit
              after reporting an error.

       -M[M]  Enable manage DSA IT control.  -MM makes control critical.

       -d_debuglevel
              Set the LDAP debugging level to debuglevel.  ldapmodrdn must be
              compiled with LDAP_DEBUG defined for this option to have any
              effect.

       -f_file
              Read the entry modification information from file instead of from
              standard input or the command-line.

       -x     Use simple authentication instead of SASL.

       -D_binddn
              Use the Distinguished Name binddn to bind to the LDAP directory.
              For SASL binds, the server is expected to ignore this value.

       -W     Prompt for simple authentication.  This is used instead of
              specifying the password on the command line.

       -w_passwd
              Use passwd as the password for simple authentication.

       -y_passwdfile
              Use complete contents of passwdfile as the password for simple
              authentication.

       -H_ldapuri
              Specify URI(s) referring to the ldap server(s); only the
              protocol/host/port fields are allowed; a list of URI, separated by
              whitespace or commas is expected.

       -h_ldaphost
              Specify an alternate host on which the ldap server is running.
              Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -p_ldapport
              Specify an alternate TCP port where the ldap server is listening.
              Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -P {2|3}
              Specify the LDAP protocol version to use.

       -O_security-properties
              Specify SASL security properties.

       -e [!]ext[=extparam]

       -E [!]ext[=extparam]

              Specify general extensions with -e and search extensions with -E.
              ´!´ indicates criticality.

              General extensions:
                [!]assert=<filter>   (an RFC 4515 Filter)
                [!]authzid=<authzid> ("dn:<dn>" or "u:<user>")
                [!]manageDSAit
                [!]noop
                ppolicy
                [!]postread[=<attrs>]        (a comma-separated attribute list)
                [!]preread[=<attrs>] (a comma-separated attribute list)
                abandon, cancel (SIGINT sends abandon/cancel; not really controls)

              Search extensions:
                [!]domainScope                               (domain scope)
                [!]mv=<filter>                               (matched values filter)
                [!]pr=<size>[/prompt|noprompt]       (paged results/prompt)
                [!]sss=[-]<attr[:OID]>[/[-]<attr[:OID]>...]  (server side sorting)
                [!]subentries[=true|false]           (subentries)
                [!]sync=ro[/<cookie>]                        (LDAP Sync refreshOnly)
                        rp[/<cookie>][/<slimit>]     (LDAP Sync refreshAndPersist)

       -I     Enable SASL Interactive mode.  Always prompt.  Default is to
              prompt only as needed.

       -Q     Enable SASL Quiet mode.  Never prompt.

       -U_authcid
              Specify the authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of the ID
              depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -R_realm
              Specify the realm of authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of
              the realm depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -X_authzid
              Specify the requested authorization ID for SASL bind.  authzid
              must be one of the following formats: dn:<distinguished name> or
              u:<username>

       -Y_mech
              Specify the SASL mechanism to be used for authentication. If it's
              not specified, the program will choose the best mechanism the
              server knows.

       -Z[Z]  Issue StartTLS (Transport Layer Security) extended operation. If
              you use -ZZ, the command will require the operation to be
              successful.

INPUT FORMAT
       If the command-line arguments dn and rdn are given, rdn will replace the
       RDN of the entry specified by the DN, dn.

       Otherwise, the contents of file (or standard input if no -f flag is
       given) should consist of one or more entries.

           Distinguished Name (DN)
           Relative Distinguished Name (RDN)

       One or more blank lines may be used to separate each DN/RDN pair.

EXAMPLE
       Assuming that the file /tmp/entrymods exists and has the contents:

           cn=Modify Me,dc=example,dc=com
           cn=The New Me

       the command:

           ldapmodrdn -r -f /tmp/entrymods

       will change the RDN of the "Modify Me" entry from "Modify Me" to "The New
       Me" and the old cn, "Modify Me" will be removed.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit status is 0 if no errors occur.  Errors result in a non-zero exit
       status and a diagnostic message being written to standard error.
