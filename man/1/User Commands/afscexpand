NAME
     afscexpand â€“ decompress files compressed with HFS+ compression

SYNOPSIS
     afscexpand [-c] path [...]

DESCRIPTION
     The afscexpand command is used to decompress files compressed with HFS+
     compression.

     Paths specified are recursively traversed (while remaining on the starting
     filesystem) and all encountered files are decompressed. If the -c option is
     specified, the encountered files will not be decompressed, but their
     contents will be printed to standard output.

HISTORY
     afscexpand first appeared in Mac OS X 10.6.
