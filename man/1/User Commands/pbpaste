PBCOPY(1)                    General Commands Manual                   PBCOPY(1)



NAME
       pbcopy, pbpaste - provide copying and pasting to the pasteboard (the
       Clipboard) from command line

SYNOPSIS
       pbcopy [-help] [-pboard {general | ruler | find | font}]

       pbpaste [-help] [-pboard {general | ruler | find | font}] [-Prefer {txt |
       rtf | ps}]

DESCRIPTION
       pbcopy takes the standard input and places it in the specified
       pasteboard. If no pasteboard is specified, the general pasteboard will be
       used by default.  The input is placed in the pasteboard as plain text
       data unless it begins with the Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file header
       or the Rich Text Format (RTF) file header, in which case it is placed in
       the pasteboard as one of those data types.

       pbpaste removes the data from the pasteboard and writes it to the
       standard output.  It normally looks first for plain text data in the
       pasteboard and writes that to the standard output; if no plain text data
       is in the pasteboard it looks for Encapsulated PostScript; if no EPS is
       present it looks for Rich Text.  If none of those types is present in the
       pasteboard, pbpaste produces no output.

       * Encoding:

       pbcopy and pbpaste use locale environment variables to determine the
       encoding to be used for input and output.  For example, absent other
       locale settings, setting the environment variable LANG=en_US.UTF-8 will
       cause pbcopy and pbpaste to use UTF-8 for input and output.  If an
       encoding cannot be determined from the locale, the standard C encoding
       will be used.  Use of UTF-8 is recommended.  Note that by default the
       Terminal application uses the UTF-8 encoding and automatically sets the
       appropriate locale environment variable.

OPTIONS
       -pboard {general | ruler | find | font}
              specifies which pasteboard to copy to or paste from.  If no
              pasteboard is given, the general pasteboard will be used by
              default.

       -Prefer {txt | rtf | ps}
              tells pbpaste what type of data to look for in the pasteboard
              first.  As stated above, pbpaste normally looks first for plain
              text data; however, by specifying -Prefer ps you can tell pbpaste
              to look first for Encapsulated PostScript.  If you specify -Prefer
              rtf, pbpaste looks first for Rich Text format.  In any case,
              pbpaste looks for the other formats if the preferred one is not
              found.  The txt option replaces the deprecated ascii option, which
              continues to function as before.  Both indicate a preference for
              plain text.

BUGS
       There is no way to tell pbpaste to get only a specified data type.
