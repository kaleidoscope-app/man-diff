SYNOPSIS

     The uuidgen command generates a Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID), a
     128-bit value guaranteed to be unique over both space and time.

     The following options are available:

     -hdr      Emit CoreFoundation CFUUID-based source code for using the uuid
               in a header.

RETURN VALUE
     The UUID is printed to standard output as a hyphen-punctuated ASCII string
     of the form: EEF45689-BBE5-4FB6-9E80-41B78F6578E2 (in printf(3) format
     "%08X-%04X-%04X-%04X-%012X"), unless the -hdr option is given, in which
     case a fragment of source code is output.
