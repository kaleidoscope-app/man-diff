NAME
       perl5243delta - what is new for perl v5.24.3

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes differences between the 5.24.2 release and the
       5.24.3 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.24.1, first read
       perl5242delta, which describes differences between 5.24.1 and 5.24.2.

Security
   [CVE-2017-12837] Heap buffer overflow in regular expression compiler
       Compiling certain regular expression patterns with the case-insensitive
       modifier could cause a heap buffer overflow and crash perl.  This has now
       been fixed.  [GH #16021] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16021>

   [CVE-2017-12883] Buffer over-read in regular expression parser
       For certain types of syntax error in a regular expression pattern, the
       error message could either contain the contents of a random, possibly
       large, chunk of memory, or could crash perl.  This has now been fixed.
       [GH #16025] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16025>

   [CVE-2017-12814] $ENV{$key} stack buffer overflow on Windows
       A possible stack buffer overflow in the %ENV code on Windows has been
       fixed by removing the buffer completely since it was superfluous anyway.
       [GH #16051] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16051>

Incompatible Changes
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.24.2.  If any
       exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report.  See
       "Reporting Bugs" below.

Modules and Pragmata

           [GH #15396] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15396> [GH #15401]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15401> [GH #15524]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15524> [cpan #120032]
           <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=120032>

Configuration and Compilation
       •   When building with GCC 6 and link-time optimization (the -flto option
           to gcc), Configure was treating all probed symbols as present on the
           system, regardless of whether they actually exist.  This has been
           fixed.  [GH #15322] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15322>

       •   Configure now aborts if both "-Duselongdouble" and "-Dusequadmath"
           are requested.  [GH #14944]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14944>

       •   Fixed a bug in which Configure could append "-quadmath" to the
           archname even if it was already present.  [GH #15423]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15423>

       •   Clang builds with "-DPERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT" or
           "-DPERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT_PRIVATE" have been fixed (by disabling Thread
           Safety Analysis for these configurations).

Platform Support
   Platform-Specific Notes
       VMS
           •   "configure.com" now recognizes the VSI-branded C compiler.

       Windows
           •   Building XS modules with GCC 6 in a 64-bit build of Perl failed
               due to incorrect mapping of "strtoll" and "strtoull".  This has
               now been fixed.  [GH #16074]
               <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16074> [cpan #121683]
               <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=121683> [cpan
               #122353] <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=122353>

Selected Bug Fixes
       •   "/@0{0*->@*/*0" and similar contortions used to crash, but no longer
           do, but merely produce a syntax error.  [GH #15333]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15333>

       •   "do" or "require" with an argument which is a reference or typeglob
           which, when stringified, contains a null character, started crashing
           in Perl 5.20, but has now been fixed.  [GH #15337]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15337>

       •   Expressions containing an "&&" or "||" operator (or their synonyms
           "and" and "or") were being compiled incorrectly in some cases.  If
           the left-hand side consisted of either a negated bareword constant or
           a negated "do {}" block containing a constant expression, and the
           right-hand side consisted of a negated non-foldable expression, one
           of the negations was effectively ignored.  The same was true of "if"
           and "unless" statement modifiers, though with the left-hand and
           right-hand sides swapped.  This long-standing bug has now been fixed.
           [GH #15285] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15285>

       •   "reset" with an argument no longer crashes when encountering stash
           entries other than globs.  [GH #15314]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15314>

       •   Assignment of hashes to, and deletion of, typeglobs named *:::::: no
           longer causes crashes.  [GH #15307]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15307>

       •   Assignment variants of any bitwise ops under the "bitwise" feature
           would crash if the left-hand side was an array or hash.  [GH #15346]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15346>

       •   "socket" now leaves the error code returned by the system in $! on
           failure.  [GH #15383] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15383>

       •   Parsing bad POSIX charclasses no longer leaks memory.  [GH #15382]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15382>

       •   Since Perl 5.20, line numbers have been off by one when perl is
           invoked with the -x switch.  This has been fixed.  [GH #15413]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15413>

       •   Some obscure cases of subroutines and file handles being freed at the
           same time could result in crashes, but have been fixed.  The crash
           was introduced in Perl 5.22.  [GH #15435]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15435>

       •   Some regular expression parsing glitches could lead to assertion
           failures with regular expressions such as "/(?<=/" and "/(?<!/".
           This has now been fixed.  [GH #15332]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15332>

       •   "gethostent" and similar functions now perform a null check
           internally, to avoid crashing with the torsocks library.  This was a
           regression from Perl 5.22.  [GH #15478]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15478>

       •   Mentioning the same constant twice in a row (which is a syntax error)
           no longer fails an assertion under debugging builds.  This was a
           regression from Perl 5.20.  [GH #15017]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15017>

       •   In Perl 5.24 "fchown" was changed not to accept negative one as an
           argument because in some platforms that is an error.  However, in
           some other platforms that is an acceptable argument.  This change has
           been reverted.  [GH #15523]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15523>.

       •   "@{x" followed by a newline where "x" represents a control or non-
           ASCII character no longer produces a garbled syntax error message or
           a crash.  [GH #15518] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15518>

       •   A regression in Perl 5.24 with "tr/\N{U+...}/foo/" when the code
           point was between 128 and 255 has been fixed.  [GH #15475]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15475>.

       •   Many issues relating to "printf "%a"" of hexadecimal floating point
           were fixed.  In addition, the "subnormals" (formerly known as
           "denormals") floating point numbers are now supported both with the
           plain IEEE 754 floating point numbers (64-bit or 128-bit) and the x86
           80-bit "extended precision".  Note that subnormal hexadecimal
           floating point literals will give a warning about "exponent
           underflow".  [GH #15495] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15495>
           [GH #15502] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15502> [GH #15503]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15503> [GH #15504]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15504> [GH #15505]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15505> [GH #15510]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15510> [GH #15512]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15512>

       •   The parser could sometimes crash if a bareword came after
           "evalbytes".  [GH #15586]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15586>

       •   Fixed a place where the regex parser was not setting the syntax error
           correctly on a syntactically incorrect pattern.  [GH #15565]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15565>

       •   A vulnerability in Perl's "sprintf" implementation has been fixed by
           avoiding a possible memory wrap.  [GH #15970]
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15970>
