DESCRIPTION
       The uustat command can display various types of status information about
       the UUCP system.  It can also be used to cancel or rejuvenate requests
       made by uucp (1) or uux (1).

       By default uustat displays all jobs queued up for the invoking user, as
       if given the --user option with the appropriate argument.

       If any of the -a, --all, -e, --executions, -s, --system, -S,
       --not-system, -u, --user, -U, --not-user, -c, --command, -C,
       --not-command, -o, --older-than, -y, --younger-than options are given,
       then all jobs which match the combined specifications are displayed.

       The -K or --kill-all option may be used to kill off a selected group of
       jobs, such as all jobs more than 7 days old.

OPTIONS
       The following options may be given to uustat.

       -a, --all
            List all queued file transfer requests.

       -e, --executions
            List queued execution requests rather than queued file transfer
            requests.  Queued execution requests are processed by uuxqt (8)
            rather than uucico (8).  Queued execution requests may be waiting
            for some file to be transferred from a remote system.  They are
            created by an invocation of uux (1).

       -s system, --system system
            List all jobs queued up for the named system.  These options may be
            specified multiple times, in which case all jobs for all the systems
            will be listed.  If used with --list only the systems named will be
            listed.

       -S system, --not-system system
            List all jobs queued for systems other than the one named.  These
            options may be specified multiple times, in which case no jobs from
            any of the specified systems will be listed.  If used with --list
            only the systems not named will be listed.  These options may not be
            used with -s or --system.

       -u user, --user user
            List all jobs queued up for the named user.  These options may be
            specified multiple times, in which case all jobs for all the users
            will be listed.

       -U user, --not-user user
            List all jobs queued up for users other than the one named.  These
            options may be specified multiple times, in which case no jobs from
            any of the specified users will be listed.  These options may not be
            used with -u or --user.

       -c command, --command command
            List all jobs requesting the execution of the named command.  If
            command is ALL this will list all jobs requesting the execution of
            some command (as opposed to simply requesting a file transfer).
            These options may be specified multiple times, in which case all
            jobs requesting any of the commands will be listed.

       -C command, --not-command command
            List all jobs requesting execution of some command other than the
            named command, or, if command is ALL, list all jobs that simply
            request a file transfer (as opposed to requesting the execution of
            some command).  These options may be specified multiple times, in
            which case no job requesting one of the specified commands will be
            listed.  These options may not be used with -c or --command.

       -o hours, --older-than hours
            List all queued jobs older than the given number of hours.  If used
            with --list only systems whose oldest job is older than the given
            number of hours will be listed.

       -y hours, --younger-than hours
            List all queued jobs younger than the given number of hours.  If
            used with --list only systems whose oldest job is younger than the
            given number of hours will be listed.

       -k jobid, --kill jobid
            Kill the named job.  The job id is shown by the default output
            format, as well as by the -j or --jobid option to uucp (1) or uux
            (1).  A job may only be killed by the user who created the job, or
            by the UUCP administrator or the superuser.  The -k or --kill
            options may be used multiple times on the command line to kill
            several jobs.

       -r jobid, --rejuvenate jobid
            Rejuvenate the named job.  This will mark it as having been invoked
            at the current time, affecting the output of the -o, --older-than,
            -y, or --younger-than options and preserving it from any automated
            cleanup daemon.  The job id is shown by the default output format,
            as well as by the -j or --jobid options to uucp (1) or uux (1).  A
            job may only be rejuvenated by the user who created the job, or by
            the UUCP administrator or the superuser.  The -r or --rejuvenate
            options may be used multiple times on the command line to rejuvenate
            several jobs.

       -q, --list
            Display the status of commands, executions and conversations for all
            remote systems for which commands or executions are queued.  The -s,
            --system, -S, --not-system, -o, --older-than, -y, and --younger-than
            options may be used to restrict the systems which are listed.
            Systems for which no commands or executions are queued will never be
            listed.

       -m, --status
            Display the status of conversations for all remote systems.

       -p, --ps
            Display the status of all processes holding UUCP locks on systems or
            ports.

       -i, --prompt
            For each listed job, prompt whether to kill the job or not.  If the
            first character of the input line is y or Y the job will be killed.

       -K, --kill-all
            Automatically kill each listed job.  This can be useful for
            automatic cleanup scripts, in conjunction with the --mail and
            --notify options.

       -R, --rejuvenate-all
            Automatically rejuvenate each listed job.  This may not be used with
            --kill-all.

       -M, --mail
            For each listed job, send mail to the UUCP administrator.  If the
            job is killed (due to --kill-all or --prompt with an affirmative
            response) the mail will indicate that.  A comment specified by the
            --comment option may be included.  If the job is an execution, the
            initial portion of its standard input will be included in the mail
            message; the number of lines to include may be set with the
            --mail-lines option (the default is 100).  If the standard input
            contains null characters, it is assumed to be a binary file and is
            not included.

       -N, --notify
            For each listed job, send mail to the user who requested the job.
            The mail is identical to that sent by the -M or --mail options.

       -W comment, --comment comment
            Specify a comment to be included in mail sent with the -M, --mail,
            -N, or --notify options.

       -B lines, --mail-lines lines
            When the -M, --mail, -N, or --notify options are used to send mail
            about an execution with standard input, this option controls the
            number of lines of standard input to include in the message.  The
            default is 100.

       -Q, --no-list
            Do not actually list the job, but only take any actions indicated by
            the -i, --prompt, -K, --kill-all, -M, --mail, -N or --notify
            options.

       -x type, --debug type
            Turn on particular debugging types.  The following types are
            recognized: abnormal, chat, handshake, uucp-proto, proto, port,
            config, spooldir, execute, incoming, outgoing.  Only abnormal,
            config, spooldir and execute are meaningful for uustat.

            Multiple types may be given, separated by commas, and the --debug
            option may appear multiple times.  A number may also be given, which
            will turn on that many types from the foregoing list; for example,
            --debug 2 is equivalent to --debug abnormal,chat.

       -I file, --config file
            Set configuration file to use.  This option may not be available,
            depending upon how uustat was compiled.

       -v, --version
            Report version information and exit.

       --help
            Print a help message and exit.

EXAMPLES
       uustat --all
       Display status of all jobs.  A sample output line is as follows:
            bugsA027h bugs ian 04-01 13:50 Executing rmail ian@airs.com (sending 1283 bytes)
       The format is
            jobid system user queue-date command (size)
       The jobid may be passed to the --kill or --rejuvenate options.  The size
       indicates how much data is to be transferred to the remote system, and is
       absent for a file receive request.  The --system, --not-system, --user,
       --not-user, --command, --not-command, --older-than, and --younger-than
       options may be used to control which jobs are listed.

       uustat --executions
       Display status of queued up execution requests.  A sample output line is
       as follows:
            bugs bugs!ian 05-20 12:51 rmail ian
       The format is
            system requestor queue-date command
       The --system, --not-system, --user, --not-user, --command, --not-command,
       --older-than, and --younger-than options may be used to control which
       requests are listed.

       uustat --list
       Display status for all systems with queued up commands.  A sample output
       line is as follows:
            bugs            4C (1 hour)   0X (0 secs) 04-01 14:45 Dial failed
       This indicates the system, the number of queued commands, the age of the
       oldest queued command, the number of queued local executions, the age of
       the oldest queued execution, the date of the last conversation, and the
       status of that conversation.

       uustat --status
       Display conversation status for all remote systems.  A sample output line
       is as follows:
            bugs           04-01 15:51 Conversation complete
       This indicates the system, the date of the last conversation, and the
       status of that conversation.  If the last conversation failed, uustat
       will indicate how many attempts have been made to call the system.  If
       the retry period is currently preventing calls to that system, uustat
       also displays the time when the next call will be permitted.

       uustat --ps
       Display the status of all processes holding UUCP locks.  The output
       format is system dependent, as uustat simply invokes ps (1) on each
       process holding a lock.

            uustat --command rmail --older-than 168 --kill-all --no-list --mail --notify --comment "Queued for over 1 week"
       This will kill all rmail commands that have been queued up waiting for
       delivery for over 1 week (168 hours).  For each such command, mail will
       be sent both to the UUCP administrator and to the user who requested the
       rmail execution.  The mail message sent will include the string given by
       the --comment option.  The --no-list option prevents any of the jobs from
       being listed on the terminal, so any output from the program will be
       error messages.
