NAME
       uupick - retrieve files transferred by uuto

SYNOPSIS
       uupick [-s system] [--system system]

DESCRIPTION
       The uupick program is used to conveniently retrieve files transferred by
       the uuto program.

       For each file transferred by uuto, uupick will display the source system,
       the file name, and whether the name refers to a regular file or a
       directory.  It will then wait for the user to specify an action to take.
       One of the following commands must be entered:

       `q'
            Quit out of `uupick'.

       `RETURN'
            Skip the file.

       `m [directory]'
            Move the file or directory to the specified directory.  If no
            directory is specified, the file is moved to the current directory.

       `a [directory]'
            Move all files from this system to the specified directory.  If no
            directory is specified, the files are moved to the current
            directory.

       `p'
            List the file on standard output.

       `d'
            Delete the file.

       `! [command]'
            Execute `command' as a shell escape.

OPTIONS
       -s system, --system system
            Used to restrict `uupick' to only present files transferred from a
            particular system.

       Standard UUCP options:

       -x type, --debug type
            Turn on particular debugging types.  The following types are
            recognized: abnormal, chat, handshake, uucp-proto, proto, port,
            config, spooldir, execute, incoming, outgoing.

       -I file, --config
            Set configuration file to use.

       -v, --version
            Report version information and exit.
