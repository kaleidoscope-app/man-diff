Acknowledgements
       Perl 5.30.2 represents approximately 4 months of development since Perl
       5.30.1 and contains approximately 2,100 lines of changes across 110 files
       from 15 authors.

       were approximately 920 lines of changes to 30 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

       Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant
       community of users and developers.  The following people are known to
       have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.30.2:

       Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Dan Book, David Mitchell, Hugo van der Sanden,
       Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Matthew Horsfall, Nicolas R., Petr
       PisaX, Renee Baecker, Sawyer X, Steve Hay, Tomasz Konojacki, Tony Cook,

       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
       generated from version control history.  In particular, it does not
       include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
       modules included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN
       community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please
       see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.

Reporting Bugs
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug
       database at <https://rt.perl.org/>.  There may also be information at
       <http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at
       <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  Be sure to trim your bug down to
       a tiny but sufficient test case.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
       inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see "SECURITY
       VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION" in perlsec for details of how to
       report the issue.

Give Thanks
       If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl
       5, you can do so by running the "perlthanks" program:

           perlthanks

       This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of
       thanks.
