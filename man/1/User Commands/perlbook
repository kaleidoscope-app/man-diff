PERLBOOK(1)             Perl Programmers Reference Guide             PERLBOOK(1)




NAME
       perlbook - Books about and related to Perl

DESCRIPTION
       There are many books on Perl and Perl-related. A few of these are good,
       some are OK, but many aren't worth your money. There is a list of these
       books, some with extensive reviews, at <http://books.perl.org/> . We list
       some of the books here, and while listing a book implies our endorsement,
       don't think that not including a book means anything.

       Most of these books are available online through Safari Books Online (
       <http://safaribooksonline.com/> ).

   The most popular books
       The major reference book on Perl, written by the creator of Perl, is
       Programming Perl:

       If you want to learn the basics of Perl, you might start with the Llama
       book, which assumes that you already know a little about programming:

       The tutorial started in the Llama continues in the Alpaca, which
       introduces the intermediate features of references, data structures,
       object-oriented programming, and modules:

   Other interesting, non-Perl books
       You might notice several familiar Perl concepts in this collection of ACM
       columns from Jon Bentley. The similarity to the title of the major Perl
       book (which came later) is not completely accidental:

       Programming Pearls
            by Jon Bentley
            ISBN 978-0-201-65788-3 [2 edition, October 1999]

       More Programming Pearls
            by Jon Bentley
            ISBN 0-201-11889-0 [January 1988]

   A note on freshness
       Each version of Perl comes with the documentation that was current at the
       time of release. This poses a problem for content such as book lists.
       There are probably very nice books published after this list was included
       in your Perl release, and you can check the latest released version at
       <http://perldoc.perl.org/perlbook.html> .

       Some of the books we've listed appear almost ancient in internet scale,
       but we've included those books because they still describe the current
       way of doing things. Not everything in Perl changes every day.  Many of
       the beginner-level books, too, go over basic features and techniques that
       are still valid today. In general though, we try to limit this list to
       books published in the past five years.

       If your Perl book isn't listed and you think it should be, let us know.
