LWP-DUMP(1)            User Contributed Perl Documentation           LWP-DUMP(1)




NAME
       lwp-dump - See what headers and content is returned for a URL

SYNOPSIS
       lwp-dump [ options ] URL

DESCRIPTION
       The lwp-dump program will get the resource identified by the URL and then
       dump the response object to STDOUT.  This will display the headers
       returned and the initial part of the content, escaped so that it's safe
       to display even binary content.  The escapes syntax used is the same as
       for Perl's double quoted strings.  If there is no content the string "(no
       content)" is shown in its place.

       The following options are recognized:

       --agent string
           Override the user agent string passed to the server.

       --keep-client-headers
           LWP internally generate various "Client-*" headers that are stripped
           by lwp-dump in order to show the headers exactly as the server
           provided them.  This option will suppress this.

       --max-length n
           How much of the content to show.  The default is 512.  Set this to 0
           for unlimited.

           If the content is longer then the string is chopped at the limit and
           the string "...\n(### more bytes not shown)" appended.

       --method string
           Use the given method for the request instead of the default "GET".

       --parse-head
           By default lwp-dump will not try to initialize headers by looking at
           the head section of HTML documents.  This option enables this.  This
           corresponds to "parse_head" in LWP::UserAgent.

       --request
           Also dump the request sent.
