SEQ(1)                       General Commands Manual                      SEQ(1)

NAME
     seq – print sequences of numbers

SYNOPSIS
     seq [-w] [-f format] [-s string] [-t string] [first [incr]] last

DESCRIPTION
     The seq utility prints a sequence of numbers, one per line (default), from
     first (default 1), to near last as possible, in increments of incr (default
     1).  When first is larger than last the default incr is -1.

     All numbers are interpreted as floating point.

     Normally integer values are printed as decimal integers.

     The seq utility accepts the following options:

     -f format     Use a printf(3) style format to print each number.  Only the
                   E, e, f, G, g, and % conversion characters are valid, along
                   with any optional flags and an optional numeric minimum field
                   width or precision.  The format can contain character escape
                   sequences in backslash notation as defined in ANSI
                   X3.159-1989 (“ANSI C89”).  The default is %g.

     -s string     Use string to separate numbers.  The string can contain
                   character escape sequences in backslash notation as defined
                   in ANSI X3.159-1989 (“ANSI C89”).  The default is \n.

     -t string     Use string to terminate sequence of numbers.  The string can
                   contain character escape sequences in backslash notation as
                   defined in ANSI X3.159-1989 (“ANSI C89”).  This option is
                   useful when the default separator does not contain a \n.

     -w            Equalize the widths of all numbers by padding with zeros as
                   necessary.  This option has no effect with the -f option.  If
                   any sequence numbers will be printed in exponential notation,
                   the default conversion is changed to %e.

     The seq utility exits 0 on success and non-zero if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
           # seq 1 3
           1
           2
           3

           # seq 3 1
           3
           2
           1

           # seq -w 0 .05 .1
           0.00
           0.05
           0.10

HISTORY
     The seq command first appeared in Plan 9 from Bell Labs.  A seq command
     appeared in NetBSD 3.0, and ported to FreeBSD 9.0.  This command was based
     on the command of the same name in Plan 9 from Bell Labs and the GNU core
     utilities.  The GNU seq command first appeared in the 1.13 shell utilities
     release.

BUGS
     The -w option does not handle the transition from pure floating point to
     exponent representation very well.  The seq command is not bug for bug
     compatible with the Plan 9 from Bell Labs or GNU versions of seq.
