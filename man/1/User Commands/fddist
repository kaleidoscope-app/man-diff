fddist(1m)                        USER COMMANDS                       fddist(1m)



NAME
       fddist - file descriptor usage distributions. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       fddist [-r|-w]

DESCRIPTION
       This prints distributions for read and write events by file descriptor,
       by process. This can be used to determine which file descriptor a process
       is doing the most I/O with.

       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

OPTIONS
       -r     reads only

       -w     writes only

EXAMPLES
       Sample both read and write activity,
              # fddist

       Sample reads only,
              # fddist -r

FIELDS
       EXEC   process name

       PID    process ID

       value  file descriptor

       count  number of events

BASED ON
       /usr/demo/dtrace/lquantize.d
