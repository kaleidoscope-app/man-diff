AUDITREDUCE(1)               General Commands Manual              AUDITREDUCE(1)

NAME
     auditreduce – select records from audit trail files

SYNOPSIS (NOW DEPRECATED)
     auditreduce [-A] [-a YYYYMMDD[HH[MM[SS]]]] [-b YYYYMMDD[HH[MM[SS]]]] [-c
     flags] [-d YYYYMMDD] [-e euid] [-f egid] [-g rgid] [-j id] [-m event] [-o
     object=value] [-r ruid] [-U] [-u auid] [-v] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The auditreduce utility selects records from the audit trail files based on
     the specified criteria.  Matching audit records are printed to the standard
     output in their raw binary form.  If no file argument is specified, the
     standard input is used by default.  Use the praudit(1) utility to print the
     selected audit records in human-readable form.

     The options are as follows:

     -A      Select all records.

     -a YYYYMMDD[HH[MM[SS]]]
             Select records that occurred after or on the given datetime.

     -b YYYYMMDD[HH[MM[SS]]]
             Select records that occurred before the given datetime.

     -c flags
             Select records matching the given audit classes specified as a
             comma separated list of audit flags.  See audit_control(5) for a
             description of audit flags.

     -d YYYYMMDD
             Select records that occurred on a given date.  This option cannot
             be used with -a or -b.

     -e euid
             Select records with the given effective user ID or name.

     -f egid
             Select records with the given effective group ID or name.

     -g rgid
             Select records with the given real group ID or name.

     -j id   Select records having a subject token with matching ID.

     -m event
             Select records with the given event name or number. This option can
             be used more then once to select records of multiple event types.
             See audit_event(5) for a description of audit event names and
             numbers.

     -o object=value

             file        Select records containing path tokens, where the
                         pathname matches one of the comma delimited extended
                         regular expression contained in given specification.
                         Regular expressions which are prefixed with a tilde
                         (‘~’) are excluded from the search results.  These
                         extended regular expressions are processed from left to
                         right, and a path will either be selected or deslected
                         based on the first match.

                         Since commas are used to delimit the regular
                         expressions, a backslash (‘\’) character should be used
                         to escape the comma if it is a part of the search
                         pattern.

             msgqid      Select records containing the given message queue ID.

             pid         Select records containing the given process ID.

             semid       Select records containing the given semaphore ID.

             shmid       Select records containing the given shared memory ID.

     -r ruid
             Select records with the given real user ID or name.

     -U      Use unbuffered output. This option is automatically set when the
             input file is a character device (e.g. /dev/auditpipe), allowing
             records to be fully processed as they are generated.

     -u auid
             Select records with the given audit ID.

     -v      Invert sense of matching, to select records that do not match.

EXAMPLES
     To select all records associated with effective user ID root from the audit
     log /var/audit/20031016184719.20031017122634:

           auditreduce -e root \
               /var/audit/20031016184719.20031017122634

     To select all setlogin(2) events from that log:

           auditreduce -m AUE_SETLOGIN \
               /var/audit/20031016184719.20031017122634

     Output from the above command lines will typically be piped to a new trail
     file, or via standard output to the praudit(1) command.

     Select all records containing a path token where the pathname contains
     /etc/master.passwd:

           auditreduce -o file="/etc/master.passwd" \
               /var/audit/20031016184719.20031017122634

     Select all records containing path tokens, where the pathname is a TTY
     device:

           auditreduce -o file="/dev/tty[a-zA-Z][0-9]+" \
               /var/audit/20031016184719.20031017122634

     Select all records containing path tokens, where the pathname is a TTY
     except for /dev/ttyp2:

           auditreduce -o file="~/dev/ttyp2,/dev/tty[a-zA-Z][0-9]+" \
               /var/audit/20031016184719.20031017122634

HISTORY
     The OpenBSM implementation was created by McAfee Research, the security
     division of McAfee Inc., under contract to Apple Computer Inc. in 2004.  It
     was subsequently adopted by the TrustedBSD Project as the foundation for
     the OpenBSM distribution.
