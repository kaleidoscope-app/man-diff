netlog(1)                    General Commands Manual                   netlog(1)

NAME
     netlog â€“ Log summary of every UDP and TCP socket when the socket is closed.

SYNOPSIS
     netlog [-v] [-i interval] [-I iterations] [-t type] [-p process-name|pid]
            [-c] [-z]

DESCRIPTION
     The netlog program logs a summary for each TCP and UDP socket when the
     socket is closed. A header is printed once. The row items are separated by
     spaces.  Address to hostname lookups are not performed. Sockets that do not
     send or receive any data are not listed unless the -z option is specified.

OPTIONS
     A list of flags and their descriptions:

     -v       Verbose output

     -i interval
              Report socket statistics periodically

     -I iterations
              Used in combination with -i, will make netlog exit after the
              specified number of iterations.

     -t type  Specify the type of interface. By default, all interfaces will be
              monitored.  Multiple interface types may be specified.  The
              following types are supported:

              wifi     WiFi interfaces

              wired    Wired interfaces

              loopback
                       Loopback interfaces

              awdl     Apple Wireless Direct Link interfaces

              expensive
                       Interfaces marked as "expensive", for example via hotspot

              undefined
                       Cases where the underlying socket is not associated with
                       an interface

              external
                       The combination of all defined non-loopback interfaces.

     -p process-name|pid
              Select a process for display.  A numeric argument identifies a
              process by its pid.  Alternatively a process name may be given, in
              which case all processes with that name will be displayed.  The
              name must be an exact match for the name displayed by netlog,
              which may require that the name be truncated, for example
              launchd.develop instead of launchd.development.  This option may
              be repeated to select multiple processes.

     -c       Print details in comma-separated values (CSV) form.

     -z       Print details even if there was no data transfer on the socket
