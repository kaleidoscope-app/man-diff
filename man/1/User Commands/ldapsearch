DESCRIPTION
       ldapsearch is a shell-accessible interface to the ldap_search_ext(3)
       library call.

       ldapsearch opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds, and performs a
       search using specified parameters.   The filter should conform to the
       string representation for search filters as defined in RFC 4515.  If not
       provided, the default filter, (objectClass=*), is used.

       If ldapsearch finds one or more entries, the attributes specified by
       attrs are returned.  If * is listed, all user attributes are returned.
       If + is listed, all operational attributes are returned.  If no attrs are
       listed, all user attributes are returned.  If only 1.1 is listed, no
       attributes will be returned.

       The search results are displayed using an extended version of LDIF.
       Option -L controls the format of the output.

OPTIONS
       -n     Show what would be done, but don't actually perform the search.
              Useful for debugging in conjunction with -v.

       -c     Continuous operation mode. Errors are reported, but ldapsearch
              will continue with searches. The default is to exit after
              reporting an error.  Only useful in conjunction with -f.

       -u     Include the User Friendly Name form of the Distinguished Name (DN)
              in the output.

       -v     Run in verbose mode, with many diagnostics written to standard
              output.

       -t[t]  A single -t writes retrieved non-printable values to a set of
              temporary files.  This is useful for dealing with values
              containing non-character data such as jpegPhoto or audio. A second
              -t writes all retrieved values to files.

       -T_path
              Write temporary files to directory specified by path (default:
              /var/tmp/)

       -F_prefix
              URL prefix for temporary files.  Default is file://path where path
              is /var/tmp/ or specified with -T.

       -A     Retrieve attributes only (no values).  This is useful when you
              just want to see if an attribute is present in an entry and are
              not interested in the specific values.

       -L     Search results are display in LDAP Data Interchange Format
              detailed in ldif(5).  A single -L restricts the output to LDIFv1.
               A second -L disables comments.  A third -L disables printing of
              the LDIF version.  The default is to use an extended version of
              LDIF.

       -M[M]  Enable manage DSA IT control.  -MM makes control critical.

       -S_attribute
              Sort the entries returned based on attribute. The default is not
              to sort entries returned.  If attribute is a zero-length string
              (""), the entries are sorted by the components of their
              Distinguished Name.  See ldap_sort(3) for more details. Note that
              ldapsearch normally prints out entries as it receives them. The
              use of the -S option defeats this behavior, causing all entries to
              be retrieved, then sorted, then printed.

       -d_debuglevel
              Set the LDAP debugging level to debuglevel.  ldapsearch must be
              compiled with LDAP_DEBUG defined for this option to have any
              effect.

       -f_file
              Read a series of lines from file, performing one LDAP search for
              each line.  In this case, the filter given on the command line is
              treated as a pattern where the first and only occurrence of %s is
              replaced with a line from file.  Any other occurrence of the the %
              character in the pattern will be regarded as an error.  Where it
              is desired that the search filter include a % character, the
              character should be encoded as \25 (see RFC 4515).  If file is a
              single - character, then the lines are read from standard input.
              ldapsearch will exit when the first non-successful search result
              is returned, unless -c is used.

       -x     Use simple authentication instead of SASL.

       -D_binddn
              Use the Distinguished Name binddn to bind to the LDAP directory.
              For SASL binds, the server is expected to ignore this value.

       -W     Prompt for simple authentication.  This is used instead of
              specifying the password on the command line.

       -w_passwd
              Use passwd as the password for simple authentication.

       -y_passwdfile
              Use complete contents of passwdfile as the password for simple
              authentication.

       -H_ldapuri
              Specify URI(s) referring to the ldap server(s); a list of URI,
              separated by whitespace or commas is expected; only the
              protocol/host/port fields are allowed.  As an exception, if no
              host/port is specified, but a DN is, the DN is used to look up the
              corresponding host(s) using the DNS SRV records, according to RFC
              2782.  The DN must be a non-empty sequence of AVAs whose attribute
              type is "dc" (domain component), and must be escaped according to
              RFC 2396.

       -h_ldaphost
              Specify an alternate host on which the ldap server is running.
              Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -p_ldapport
              Specify an alternate TCP port where the ldap server is listening.
              Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -b_searchbase
              Use searchbase as the starting point for the search instead of the
              default.

       -s {base|one|sub|children}
              Specify the scope of the search to be one of base, one, sub, or
              children to specify a base object, one-level, subtree, or children
              search.  The default is sub.  Note: children scope requires LDAPv3
              subordinate feature extension.

       -a {never|always|search|find}
              Specify how aliases dereferencing is done.  Should be one of
              never, always, search, or find to specify that aliases are never
              dereferenced, always dereferenced, dereferenced when searching, or
              dereferenced only when locating the base object for the search.
              The default is to never dereference aliases.

       -P {2|3}
              Specify the LDAP protocol version to use.

       -e [!]ext[=extparam]

       -E [!]ext[=extparam]

              Specify general extensions with -e and search extensions with -E.
              ´!´ indicates criticality.

              General extensions:
                [!]assert=<filter>   (an RFC 4515 Filter)
                [!]authzid=<authzid> ("dn:<dn>" or "u:<user>")
                [!]manageDSAit
                [!]noop
                ppolicy
                [!]postread[=<attrs>]        (a comma-separated attribute list)
                [!]preread[=<attrs>] (a comma-separated attribute list)
                abandon, cancel (SIGINT sends abandon/cancel; not really controls)

              Search extensions:
                [!]domainScope                       (domain scope)
                [!]mv=<filter>                       (matched values filter)
                [!]pr=<size>[/prompt|noprompt]       (paged results/prompt)
                [!]sss=[-]<attr[:OID]>[/[-]<attr[:OID]>...]  (server side sorting)
                [!]subentries[=true|false]           (subentries)
                [!]sync=ro[/<cookie>]                (LDAP Sync refreshOnly)
                        rp[/<cookie>][/<slimit>]     (LDAP Sync refreshAndPersist)
                [!]vlv=<before>/<after>(/<offset>/<count>|:<value>)  (virtual list view)

       -l_timelimit
              wait at most timelimit seconds for a search to complete.  A
              timelimit of 0 (zero) or none means no limit.  A timelimit of max
              means the maximum integer allowable by the protocol.  A server may
              impose a maximal timelimit which only the root user may override.

       -z_sizelimit
              retrieve at most sizelimit entries for a search.  A sizelimit of 0
              (zero) or none means no limit.  A sizelimit of max means the
              maximum integer allowable by the protocol.  A server may impose a
              maximal sizelimit which only the root user may override.

       -O_security-properties
              Specify SASL security properties.

       -I     Enable SASL Interactive mode.  Always prompt.  Default is to
              prompt only as needed.

       -Q     Enable SASL Quiet mode.  Never prompt.

       -U_authcid
              Specify the authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of the ID
              depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -R_realm
              Specify the realm of authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of
              the realm depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -X_authzid
              Specify the requested authorization ID for SASL bind.  authzid
              must be one of the following formats: dn:<distinguished name> or
              u:<username>

       -Y_mech
              Specify the SASL mechanism to be used for authentication. If it's
              not specified, the program will choose the best mechanism the
              server knows.

       -Z[Z]  Issue StartTLS (Transport Layer Security) extended operation. If
              you use -ZZ, the command will require the operation to be
              successful.

OUTPUT FORMAT
       If one or more entries are found, each entry is written to standard
       output in LDAP Data Interchange Format or ldif(5):

           version: 1

           # bjensen, example, net
           dn: uid=bjensen,dc=example,dc=net
           objectClass: person
           objectClass: dcObject
           uid: bjensen
           cn: Barbara Jensen
           sn: Jensen
           ...

       If the -t option is used, the URI of a temporary file is used in place of
       the actual value.  If the -A option is given, only the "attributename"
       part is written.

EXAMPLE
       The following command:

           ldapsearch -LLL "(sn=smith)" cn sn telephoneNumber

       will perform a subtree search (using the default search base and other
       parameters defined in ldap.conf(5)) for entries with a surname (sn) of
       smith.  The common name (cn), surname (sn) and telephoneNumber values
       will be retrieved and printed to standard output.  The output might look
       something like this if two entries are found:

           dn: uid=jts,dc=example,dc=com
           cn: John Smith
           cn: John T. Smith
           sn: Smith
           sn;lang-en: Smith
           sn;lang-de: Schmidt
           telephoneNumber: 1 555 123-4567

           dn: uid=sss,dc=example,dc=com
           cn: Steve Smith
           cn: Steve S. Smith
           sn: Smith
           sn;lang-en: Smith
           sn;lang-de: Schmidt
           telephoneNumber: 1 555 765-4321

       The command:

           ldapsearch -LLL -u -t "(uid=xyz)" jpegPhoto audio

       will perform a subtree search using the default search base for entries
       with user id of "xyz".  The user friendly form of the entry's DN will be
       output after the line that contains the DN itself, and the jpegPhoto and
       audio values will be retrieved and written to temporary files.  The
       output might look like this if one entry with one value for each of the
       requested attributes is found:

           dn: uid=xyz,dc=example,dc=com
           ufn: xyz, example, com
           audio:< file:///tmp/ldapsearch-audio-a19924
           jpegPhoto:< file:///tmp/ldapsearch-jpegPhoto-a19924

       This command:

           ldapsearch -LLL -s one -b "c=US" "(o=University*)" o description

       will perform a one-level search at the c=US level for all entries whose
       organization name (o) begins begins with University.  The organization
       name and description attribute values will be retrieved and printed to
       standard output, resulting in output similar to this:

           dn: o=University of Alaska Fairbanks,c=US
           o: University of Alaska Fairbanks
           description: Preparing Alaska for a brave new yesterday
           description: leaf node only

           dn: o=University of Colorado at Boulder,c=US
           o: University of Colorado at Boulder
           description: No personnel information
           description: Institution of education and research

           dn: o=University of Colorado at Denver,c=US
           o: University of Colorado at Denver
           o: UCD
           o: CU/Denver
           o: CU-Denver
           description: Institute for Higher Learning and Research

           dn: o=University of Florida,c=US
           o: University of Florida
           o: UFl
           description: Warper of young minds

           ...

DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit status is zero if no errors occur.  Errors result in a non-zero exit
       status and a diagnostic message being written to standard error.
