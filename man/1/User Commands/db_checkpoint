db_checkpoint(1)             General Commands Manual            db_checkpoint(1)

NAME
     db_checkpoint

SYNOPSIS
     db_checkpoint [-1Vv] [-h home] [-k kbytes] [-L file] [-P password] [-p min]

DESCRIPTION
     The db_checkpoint utility is a daemon process that monitors the database
     log, and periodically calls DB_ENV->txn_checkpoint to checkpoint it.

     The options are as follows:

     -1
       Checkpoint the log once, regardless of whether or not there has been
       activity since the last checkpoint and then exit.

     -h
       Specify a home directory for the database environment; by default, the
       current working directory is used.

     -k
       Checkpoint the database at least as often as every kbytes of log file are
       written.

     -L
       Log the execution of the db_checkpoint utility to the specified file in
       the following format, where ### is the process ID, and the date is the
       time the utility was started.

             db_checkpoint: ### Wed Jun 15 01:23:45 EDT 1995

       This file will be removed if the db_checkpoint utility exits gracefully.

     -P
       Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite
       password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a window of
       vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see command-line
       arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory
       containing the command-line arguments.

     -p
       Checkpoint the database at least every min minutes if there has been any
       activity since the last checkpoint.

     -V
       Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

     -v
       Write the time of each checkpoint attempt to the standard output.

     At least one of the -1, -k, and -p options must be specified.

     The db_checkpoint utility uses a Berkeley DB environment (as described for
     the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the utility was
     run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment). In order to avoid
     environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment, db_checkpoint
     should always be given the chance to detach from the environment and exit
     gracefully. To cause db_checkpoint to release all environment resources and
     exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).

     The db_checkpoint utility does not attempt to create the Berkeley DB shared
     memory regions if they do not already exist. The application that creates
     the region should be started first, and once the region is created, the
     db_checkpoint utility should be started.

     The DB_ENV->txn_checkpoint method is the underlying method used by the
     db_checkpoint utility. See the db_checkpoint utility source code for an
     example of using DB_ENV->txn_checkpoint in a IEEE/ANSI Std 1003.1 (POSIX)
     environment.

     The db_checkpoint utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

ENVIRONMENT
     DB_HOME  If the -h option is not specified and the environment variable
              DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as
              described in DB_ENV->open.
