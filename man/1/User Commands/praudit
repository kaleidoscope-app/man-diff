PRAUDIT(1)                   General Commands Manual                  PRAUDIT(1)

NAME
     praudit â€“ print the contents of audit trail files

SYNOPSIS (NOW DEPRECATED)
     praudit [-lnpx] [-r | -s] [-d del] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The praudit utility prints the contents of the audit trail files to the
     standard output in human-readable form.  If no file argument is specified,
     the standard input is used by default.

     The options are as follows:

     -d del  Specifies the delimiter.  The default delimiter is the comma.

     -l      Prints the entire record on the same line.  If this option is not
             specified, every token is displayed on a different line.

     -n      Do not convert user and group IDs to their names but leave in their
             numeric forms.

     -p      Specify this option if input to praudit is piped from the tail(1)
             utility.  This causes praudit to sync to the start of the next
             record.

     -r      Prints the records in their raw form.  Show records and event types
             in a numeric form (also known as raw form).  This option is
             exclusive from -s.

     -s      Prints the records in their short form. Show records and events in
             a short textual representation.  This option is exclusive from -r.

     -x      Print audit records in the XML output format.

     If the raw or short forms are not specified, the default is to print the
     tokens in their raw form.  Events are displayed as per their descriptions
     given in /etc/security/audit_event; UIDs and GIDs are expanded to their
     names; dates and times are displayed in human-readable format.
