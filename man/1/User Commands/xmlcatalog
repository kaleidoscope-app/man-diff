XMLCATALOG(1)                   xmlcatalog Manual                  XMLCATALOG(1)



NAME
       xmlcatalog - Command line tool to parse and manipulate XML or SGML
       catalog files.

SYNOPSIS
       xmlcatalog [--sgml | --shell | --create | --del VALUE(S) |
                  [ --add TYPE ORIG REPLACE  | --add FILENAME] | --noout |
                  --no-super-update | [-v | --verbose]] {CATALOGFILE}
                  {ENTITIES...}

DESCRIPTION
       xmlcatalog is a command line application allowing users to monitor and
       manipulate XML and SGML catalogs. It is included in libxml(3).

       Its functions can be invoked from a single command from the command line,
       or it can perform multiple functions in interactive mode. It can operate
       on both XML and SGML files.

OPTIONS
       xmlcatalog accepts the following options (in alphabetical order):

       --add TYPE ORIG REPLACE
           Add an entry to CATALOGFILE.  TYPE indicates the type of entry.
           Possible types are: public, system, uri, rewriteSystem, rewriteURI,
           delegatePublic, delegateSystem, delegateURI, nextCatalog.  ORIG is
           the original reference to be replaced, and REPLACE is the URI of the
           replacement entity to be used. The --add option will not overwrite
           CATALOGFILE, outputting to stdout, unless --noout is used. The --add
           will always take three parameters even if some of the XML catalog
           constructs will have only a single argument.

       --add FILENAME
           If the --add option is used following the --sgml option, only a
           single argument, a FILENAME, is used. This is used to add the name of
           a catalog file to an SGML supercatalog, a file that contains
           references to other included SGML catalog files.

       --create
           Create a new XML catalog. Outputs to stdout, ignoring filename unless
           --noout is used, in which case it creates a new catalog file
           filename.

       --del VALUE(S)
           Remove entries from CATALOGFILE matching VALUE(S). The --del option
           will not overwrite CATALOGFILE, outputting to stdout, unless --noout
           is used.

       --noout
           Save output to the named file rather than outputting to stdout.

       --no-super-update
           Do not update the SGML super catalog.

       --shell
           Run a shell allowing interactive queries on catalog file CATALOGFILE.
           For the set of available commands see the section called “SHELL
           COMMANDS”.

       --sgml
           Uses SGML super catalogs for --add and --del options.

       -v, --verbose
           Output debugging information.

SHELL COMMANDS
       Invoking xmlcatalog with the --shell CATALOGFILE option opens a command
       line shell allowing interactive access to the catalog file identified by
       CATALOGFILE. Invoking the shell provides a command line prompt after
       which the following commands (described in alphabetical order) can be
       entered.

       add TYPE ORIG REPLACE
           Add an entry to the catalog file.  TYPE indicates the type of entry.
           Possible types are: public, system, uri, rewriteSystem, rewriteURI,
           delegatePublic, delegateSystem, delegateURI, nextCatalog.  ORIG is
           the original reference to be replaced, and REPLACE is the URI of the
           replacement entity to be used. The --add option will not overwrite
           CATALOGFILE, outputting to stdout, unless --noout is used. The --add
           will always take three parameters even if some of the XML catalog
           constructs will have only a single argument.

       debug
           Print debugging statements showing the steps xmlcatalog is executing.

       del VALUE(S)
           Remove the catalog entry corresponding to VALUE(S).

       dump
           Print the current catalog.

       exit
           Quit the shell.

       public PUBLIC-ID
           Execute a Formal Public Identifier look-up of the catalog entry for
           PUBLIC-ID. The corresponding entry will be output to the command
           line.

       quiet
           Stop printing debugging statements.

       system SYSTEM-ID
           Execute a Formal Public Identifier look-up of the catalog entry for
           SYSTEM-ID. The corresponding entry will be output to the command
           line.

ENVIRONMENT
       XML_CATALOG_FILES
           XML catalog behavior can be changed by redirecting queries to the
           user's own set of catalogs. This can be done by setting the
           XML_CATALOG_FILES environment variable to a list of catalogs. An
           empty one should deactivate loading the default /etc/xml/catalog
           catalog.

DIAGNOSTICS
       xmlcatalog return codes provide information that can be used when calling
       it from scripts.
