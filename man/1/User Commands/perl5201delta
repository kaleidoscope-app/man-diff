NAME
       perl5201delta - what is new for perl v5.20.1

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes differences between the 5.20.0 release and the
       5.20.1 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.18.0, first read
       perl5200delta, which describes differences between 5.18.0 and 5.20.0.

Incompatible Changes
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.20.0.  If any
       exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report.  See
       "Reporting Bugs" below.

Performance Enhancements
       •   An optimization to avoid problems with COW and deliberately
           overallocated PVs has been disabled because it interfered with
           another, more important, optimization, causing a slowdown on some
           platforms.  [perl #121975]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121975>

       •   Returning a string from a lexical variable could be slow in some
           cases.  This has now been fixed.  [perl #121977]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121977>

Modules and Pragmata
   Updated Modules and Pragmata
       •   Config::Perl::V has been upgraded from version 0.20 to 0.22.

           The list of Perl versions covered has been updated and some flaws in
           the parsing have been fixed.

       •   Exporter has been upgraded from version 5.70 to 5.71.

           Illegal POD syntax in the documentation has been corrected.

       •   ExtUtils::CBuilder has been upgraded from version 0.280216 to
           0.280217.

           Android builds now link to both -lperl and $Config::Config{perllibs}.

       •   File::Copy has been upgraded from version 2.29 to 2.30.

           The documentation now notes that "copy" will not overwrite read-only
           files.

       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 3.11 to 5.020001.

           The list of Perl versions covered has been updated.

       •   The PathTools module collection has been upgraded from version 3.47
           to 3.48.

           Fallbacks are now in place when cross-compiling for Android and
           $Config::Config{sh} is not yet defined.  [perl #121963]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121963>

       •   PerlIO::via has been upgraded from version 0.14 to 0.15.

           A minor portability improvement has been made to the XS
           implementation.

       •   Unicode::UCD has been upgraded from version 0.57 to 0.58.

           The documentation includes many clarifications and fixes.

       •   utf8 has been upgraded from version 1.13 to 1.13_01.

           The documentation has some minor formatting improvements.

       •   version has been upgraded from version 0.9908 to 0.9909.

           External libraries and Perl may have different ideas of what the
           locale is.  This is problematic when parsing version strings if the
           locale's numeric separator has been changed.  Version parsing has
           been patched to ensure it handles the locales correctly.  [perl
           #121930] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121930>

Documentation
   Changes to Existing Documentation
       perlapi

       •   "av_len" - Emphasize that this returns the highest index in the
           array, not the size of the array.  [perl #120386]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=120386>

       •   Note that "SvSetSV" doesn't do set magic.

       •   "sv_usepvn_flags" - Fix documentation to mention the use of "NewX"
           instead of "malloc".  [perl #121869]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121869>

       •   Clarify where "NUL" may be embedded or is required to terminate a
           string.

       perlfunc

       •   Clarify the meaning of "-B" and "-T".

       •   "-l" now notes that it will return false if symlinks aren't supported
           by the file system.  [perl #121523]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121523>

       •   Note that "each", "keys" and "values" may produce different orderings
           for tied hashes compared to other perl hashes.  [perl #121404]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121404>

       •   Note that "exec LIST" and "system LIST" may fall back to the shell on
           Win32.  Only "exec PROGRAM LIST" and "system PROGRAM LIST" indirect
           object syntax will reliably avoid using the shell.  This has also
           been noted in perlport.  [perl #122046]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122046>

       •   Clarify the meaning of "our".  [perl #122132]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122132>

       perlguts

       •   Explain various ways of modifying an existing SV's buffer.  [perl
           #116925] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=116925>

       perlpolicy

       •   We now have a code of conduct for the p5p mailing list, as documented
           in "STANDARDS OF CONDUCT" in perlpolicy.

       perlre

       •   The "/x" modifier has been clarified to note that comments cannot be
           continued onto the next line by escaping them.

       perlsyn

       •   Mention the use of empty conditionals in "for"/"while" loops for
           infinite loops.

       perlxs

       •   Added a discussion of locale issues in XS code.

Diagnostics
       The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic output,
       including warnings and fatal error messages.  For the complete list of
       diagnostic messages, see perldiag.

   Changes to Existing Diagnostics
       •   Variable length lookbehind not implemented in regex m/%s/

           Information about Unicode behaviour has been added.

Configuration and Compilation
       •   Building Perl no longer writes to the source tree when configured
           with Configure's -Dmksymlinks option.  [perl #121585]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121585>

Platform Support
   Platform-Specific Notes
       Android
           Build support has been improved for cross-compiling in general and
           for Android in particular.

       OpenBSD
           Corrected architectures and version numbers used in configuration
           hints when building Perl.

       Solaris
           c99 options have been cleaned up, hints look for solstudio as well as
           SUNWspro, and support for native "setenv" has been added.

       VMS An old bug in feature checking, mainly affecting pre-7.3 systems, has
           been fixed.

       Windows
           %I64d is now being used instead of %lld for MinGW.

Internal Changes
       •   Added "sync_locale" in perlapi.  Changing the program's locale should
           be avoided by XS code.  Nevertheless, certain non-Perl libraries
           called from XS, such as "Gtk" do so.  When this happens, Perl needs
           to be told that the locale has changed.  Use this function to do so,
           before returning to Perl.

Selected Bug Fixes
       •   A bug has been fixed where zero-length assertions and code blocks
           inside of a regex could cause "pos" to see an incorrect value.  [perl
           #122460] <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122460>

       •   Using "s///e" on tainted utf8 strings could issue bogus "Malformed
           UTF-8 character (unexpected end of string)" warnings.  This has now
           been fixed.  [perl #122148]
           <https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122148>

       •   "system" and friends should now work properly on more Android builds.

           Due to an oversight, the value specified through -Dtargetsh to
           Configure would end up being ignored by some of the build process.
           This caused perls cross-compiled for Android to end up with defective
           versions of "system", "exec" and backticks: the commands would end up
           looking for /bin/sh instead of /system/bin/sh, and so would fail for
           the vast majority of devices, leaving $! as "ENOENT".

       •   Many issues have been detected by Coverity <http://www.coverity.com/>
           and fixed.

       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant
       community of users and developers.  The following people are known to
       have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.20.1:

       Aaron Crane, Abigail, Alberto Simo~es, Alexandr Ciornii, Alexandre
       (Midnite) Jousset, Andrew Fresh, Andy Dougherty, Brian Fraser, Chris

       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
       generated from version control history.  In particular, it does not
       include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
       modules included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN
       community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors, please
       see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.

Reporting Bugs
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
       recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
       database at https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
       http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
       included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
       sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of "perl
       -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
       porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
       send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed
       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
       committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure
       out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate
       or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported.
       Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl core, not
       for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
