GROUPS(1)                    General Commands Manual                   GROUPS(1)

NAME
     groups – show group memberships

SYNOPSIS
     groups [user]

DESCRIPTION
     The groups utility has been obsoleted by the id(1) utility, and is
     equivalent to “id -Gn [user]”.  The command “id -p” is suggested for normal
     interactive use.

     The groups utility displays the groups to which you (or the optionally
     specified user) belong.

EXIT STATUS
     The groups utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Show groups the root user belongs to:

           $ groups root
           wheel operator
