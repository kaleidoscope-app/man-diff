NAME
       dbilogstrip - filter to normalize DBI trace logs for diff'ing

SYNOPSIS
       Read DBI trace file "dbitrace.log" and write out a stripped version to
       "dbitrace_stripped.log"

         dbilogstrip dbitrace.log > dbitrace_stripped.log

       Run "yourscript.pl" twice, each with different sets of arguments, with
       DBI_TRACE enabled. Filter the output and trace through "dbilogstrip" into
       a separate file for each run. Then compare using diff. (This example
       assumes you're using a standard shell.)

         DBI_TRACE=2 perl yourscript.pl ...args1... 2>&1 | dbilogstrip > dbitrace1.log
         DBI_TRACE=2 perl yourscript.pl ...args2... 2>&1 | dbilogstrip > dbitrace2.log
         diff -u dbitrace1.log dbitrace2.log

DESCRIPTION
       Replaces any hex addresses, e.g, 0x128f72ce with "0xN".

       Replaces any references to process id or thread id, like "pid#6254" with
       "pidN".

       So a DBI trace line like this:

         -> STORE for DBD::DBM::st (DBI::st=HASH(0x19162a0)~0x191f9c8 'f_params' ARRAY(0x1922018)) thr#1800400

       will look like this:

         -> STORE for DBD::DBM::st (DBI::st=HASH(0xN)~0xN 'f_params' ARRAY(0xN)) thrN
