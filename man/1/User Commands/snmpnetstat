SNMPNETSTAT(1)                      Net-SNMP                      SNMPNETSTAT(1)



NAME
       snmpnetstat - display networking status and configuration information
       from a network entity via SNMP

SYNOPSIS
       snmpnetstat [COMMON OPTIONS] [-Ca] [-Cn] AGENT
       snmpnetstat [COMMON OPTIONS] [-Ci] [-Co] [-Cr] [-Cn] [-Cs] AGENT
       snmpnetstat [COMMON OPTIONS] [-Ci] [-Cn] [-CI interface] AGENT [interval]
       snmpnetstat [COMMON OPTIONS] [-Ca] [-Cn] [-Cs] [-Cp protocol] AGENT

DESCRIPTION
       The snmpnetstat command symbolically displays the values of various
       network-related information retrieved from a remote system using the SNMP
       protocol.  There are a number of output formats, depending on the options
       for the information presented.  The first form of the command displays a
       list of active sockets.  The second form presents the values of other
       network-related information according to the option selected.  Using the
       third form, with an interval specified, snmpnetstat will continuously
       display the information regarding packet traffic on the configured
       network interfaces.  The fourth form displays statistics about the named
       protocol.

       snmpnetstat will issue GETBULK requests to query for information if at
       least protocol version v2 is used.

       AGENT identifies a target SNMP agent, which is instrumented to monitor
       the given objects.  At its simplest, the AGENT specification will consist
       of a hostname or an IPv4 address. In this situation, the command will
       attempt communication with the agent, using UDP/IPv4 to port 161 of the
       given target host. See snmpcmd(1) for a full list of the possible formats
       for AGENT.

OPTIONS
       The options have the following meaning:

       COMMON OPTIONS
        Please see snmpcmd(1) for a list of possible values for common options
       as well as their descriptions.

       -Ca With the default display, show the state of all sockets; normally
       sockets used by server processes are not shown.

       -Ci Show the state of all of the network interfaces.  The  interface
       display  provides  a  table  of cumulative statistics regarding packets
       transferred, errors, and collisions.  The  network addresses of the
       interface and the maximum transmission unit (``mtu'') are also displayed.

       -Co Show an abbreviated interface status, giving octets in place of
       packets.  This is useful when enquiring virtual interfaces (such as
       Frame-Relay circuits) on a router.

       -CI interface Show information only about this interface; used with an
       interval as described below.

       -Cn Show network addresses as numbers (normally snmpnetstat interprets
       addresses and attempts to display them symbolically).  This option may be
       used with any of the display formats.

       -Cp protocol Show statistics about protocol, which is either a well-known
       name for a protocol or an alias for it.  Some protocol names and aliases
       are listed in the file /etc/protocols.  A null response typically means
       that there are no interesting numbers to report.  The program will
       complain if protocol is unknown or if there is no statistics routine for
       it.

       -Cs Show per-protocol statistics.  When used with the -Cr option, show
       routing statistics instead.

       -Cr Show the routing tables.  When -Cs is also present, show per-protocol
       routing statistics instead of the routing tables.

       -CR repeaters For GETBULK requests, repeaters specifies the max-repeaters
       value to use.

       When  snmpnetstat is invoked with an interval argument, it displays a
       running count of statistics related to  network interfaces.  interval is
       the number of seconds between reporting of statistics.

       The Active Sockets Display (default)

       The default display, for active sockets, shows the local and remote
       addresses, protocol, and the internal state  of the   protocol.
       Address   formats   are   of  the  form ``host.port'' or ``network.port''
       if  a  socket's  address specifies  a  network  but no specific host
       address.  When known, the host and network addresses are displayed
       symbolically according   to  the  data  bases /etc/hosts and
       /etc/networks, respectively.  If a symbolic  name  for  an address  is
       unknown, or if the -Cn option is specified, the address is printed
       numerically, according to  the  address family.  For more information
       regarding the Internet ``dot format,'' refer  to inet(3N).  Unspecified,
       or  ``wildcard'', addresses and ports appear as ``*''.

       The Interface Display

       The  interface  display  provides  a  table  of cumulative statistics
       regarding packets transferred, errors, and col- lisions.   The  network
       addresses of the interface and the maximum transmission unit (``mtu'')
       are also displayed.

       The Routing Table Display

       The routing table display indicates the  available  routes and  their
       status.   Each route consists of a destination host or network and a
       gateway to use in  forwarding  pack- ets.   The flags field shows the
       state of the route (``U'' if ``up''), whether the route is  to  a
       gateway  (``G''), whether  the  route  was created dynamically by a
       redirect (``D''), and whether the route  has  been  modified  by  a
       redirect  (``M'').   Direct  routes  are  created for each interface
       attached to the local host;  the  gateway  field for  such entries shows
       the address of the outgoing inter- face.  The interface entry indicates
       the network interface utilized for the route.

       The Interface Display with an Interval

       When snmpnetstat is invoked with an interval argument, it displays a
       running count of statistics related to  network interfaces.   This
       display  consists  of a column for the primary interface and a column
       summarizing information for all  interfaces.   The  primary  interface
       may be replaced with another interface with the -CI option.  The first
       line of each screen of information contains a summary since the system
       was last rebooted.  Subsequent lines of output show values accumulated
       over the preceding interval.

       The Active Sockets Display for a Single Protocol

       When a protocol is specified with the -Cp option, the information
       displayed is similar to that in the default display for active sockets,
       except the display is limited to the given protocol.
