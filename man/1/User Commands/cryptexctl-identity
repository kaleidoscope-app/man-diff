CRYPTEXCTL-IDENTITY(1)       General Commands Manual      CRYPTEXCTL-IDENTITY(1)

NAME
     cryptexctl identity â€“ print the host's personalization identity

SYNOPSIS
     cryptexctl identity identity

DESCRIPTION
     Query and fetch the host's personalization identity. The identifiers
     displayed by this command uniquely identify the host.

     These identifiers can be used with cryptexctl-create(1) to personalize a
     cryptex for a device when the device is not present.

ENVIRONMENT
     CRYPTEXCTL_UDID
                   Read by cryptexctl identity to set the ---udid option on the
                   base cryptexctl(1) command. This UDID value can be retrieved
                   from the cryptexctl-device(1) command's list or print actions
                   and provides a convenient way to operate on a single device
                   when multiple devices are connected.

                   The magic value "first" will select the first discovered
                   device.

TROUBLESHOOTING
     This command will communicate with the local cryptex subsystem if --udid or
     CRYPTEXTCTL_UDID is not specified. When manually personalizing a cryptex
     with cryptexctl-create(1) ensure you are communicating with the device you
     expect by confirming the UDID matches with the output from
     cryptexctl-device(1).
