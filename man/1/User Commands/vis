VIS(1)                       General Commands Manual                      VIS(1)

NAME
     vis – display non-printable characters in a visual format

SYNOPSIS
     vis [-cbflnostw] [-F foldwidth] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The vis utility is a filter for converting non-printable characters into a
     visual representation.  It differs from ‘cat -v’ in that the form is unique
     and invertible.  By default, all non-graphic characters except space, tab,
     and newline are encoded.  A detailed description of the various visual
     formats is given in vis(3).

     The options are as follows:

     -b      Turns off prepending of backslash before up-arrow control sequences
             and meta characters, and disables the doubling of backslashes.
             This produces output which is neither invertible or precise, but
             does represent a minimum of change to the input.  It is similar to
             “cat -v”.

     -c      Request a format which displays a small subset of the non-printable
             characters using C-style backslash sequences.

     -F      Causes vis to fold output lines to foldwidth columns (default 80),
             like fold(1), except that a hidden newline sequence is used, (which
             is removed when inverting the file back to its original form with
             unvis(1)).  If the last character in the encoded file does not end
             in a newline, a hidden newline sequence is appended to the output.
             This makes the output usable with various editors and other
             utilities which typically do not work with partial lines.

     -f      Same as -F.

     -l      Mark newlines with the visible sequence ‘\$’, followed by the
             newline.

     -n      Turns off any encoding, except for the fact that backslashes are
             still doubled and hidden newline sequences inserted if -f or -F is
             selected.  When combined with the -f flag, vis becomes like an
             invertible version of the fold(1) utility.  That is, the output can
             be unfolded by running the output through unvis(1).

     -o      Request a format which displays non-printable characters as an
             octal number, \ddd.

     -s      Only characters considered unsafe to send to a terminal are
             encoded.  This flag allows backspace, bell, and carriage return in
             addition to the default space, tab and newline.

     -t      Tabs are also encoded.

     -w      White space (space-tab-newline) is also encoded.

HISTORY
     The vis command appeared in 4.4BSD.

BUGS
     Due to limitations in the underlying vis(3) function, the vis utility does
     not recognize multibyte characters, and thus may consider them to be non-
     printable when they are in fact printable (and vice versa).
