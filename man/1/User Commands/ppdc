NAME
       ppdc - cups ppd compiler (deprecated)

SYNOPSIS
       ppdc [ -D name[=value] ] [ -I include-directory ] [ -c message-catalog ]
       [ -d output-directory ] [ -l language(s) ] [ -m ] [ -t ] [ -v ] [ -z ] [
       --cr ] [ --crlf ] [ --lf ] source-file

DESCRIPTION
       ppdc compiles PPDC source files into one or more PPD files.  This program
       is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of CUPS.

OPTIONS
       ppdc supports the following options:

       -D name[=value]
            Sets the named variable for use in the source file.  It is
            equivalent to using the #define directive in the source file.

       -I include-directory
            Specifies an alternate include directory.  Multiple -I options can
            be supplied to add additional directories.

       -c message-catalog
            Specifies a single message catalog file in GNU gettext (filename.po)
            or Apple strings (filename.strings) format to be used for
            localization.

       -d output-directory
            Specifies the output directory for PPD files.  The default output
            directory is "ppd".

       -l language(s)
            Specifies one or more languages to use when localizing the PPD
            file(s).  The default language is "en" (English).  Separate multiple
            languages with commas, for example
            "de_DE,en_UK,es_ES,es_MX,es_US,fr_CA,fr_FR,it_IT" will create PPD
            files with German, UK English, Spanish (Spain, Mexico, and US),
            French (France and Canada), and Italian languages in each file.

       -m   Specifies that the output filename should be based on the ModelName
            value instead of FileName or PCFilenName.

       -t   Specifies that PPD files should be tested instead of generated.

       -v   Specifies verbose output, basically a running status of which files
            are being loaded or written.  -z Generates compressed PPD files
            (filename.ppd.gz).  The default is to generate uncompressed PPD
            files.

       --cr

       --crlf

       --lf Specifies the line ending to use - carriage return, carriage return
            and line feed, or line feed alone.  The default is to use the line
            feed character alone.

NOTES
       PPD files are deprecated and will no longer be supported in a future
       feature release of CUPS.  Printers that do not support IPP can be
       supported using applications such as ippeveprinter(1).
