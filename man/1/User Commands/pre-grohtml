DESCRIPTION
       The grohtml front end (which consists of a preprocessor, pre-grohtml, and
       a device driver, post-grohtml) translates the output of GNU troff to
       html.  Users should always invoke grohtml via the groff command with a
       -Thtml option.  If no files are given, grohtml will read the standard
       input.  A filename of - will also cause grohtml to read the standard
       input.  Html output is written to the standard output.  When grohtml is
       run by groff options can be passed to grohtml using groff's -P option.

OPTIONS
       -aaa-text-bits
              Number of bits of antialiasing information to be used by text when
              generating png images.  The default is 4 but valid values are 0,
              1, 2, and 4.  Note your version of gs needs to support the
              -dTextAlphaBits and -dGraphicAlphaBits options in order to exploit
              antialiasing.  A value of 0 stops grohtml from issuing
              antialiasing commands to gs.

       -b     Initialize the background color to white.

       -Ddir  Inform grohtml to place all image files into directory dir.

       -Fdir  Prepend directory dir/devname to the search path for font and
              device description files; name is the name of the device, usually
              html.

       -gaa-graphic-bits
              Number of bits of antialiasing information to be used by graphics
              when generating png images.  The default is 4 but valid values are
              0, 1, 2, and 4.  Note your version of gs needs to support the
              -dTextAlphaBits and -dGraphicAlphaBits options in order to exploit
              antialiasing.  A value of 0 stops grohtml from issuing
              antialiasing commands to gs.

       -h     Generate section and number headings by using <B>...</B> and
              increasing the font size, rather than using the <Hn>...</Hn> tags.

       -iresolution
              Select the resolution for all images.  By default this is 100
              pixels per inch.  Example: -i200 indicates 200 pixels per inch.

       -Istem Determine the image stem name.  If omitted grohtml uses
              grohtml-XXX (XXX is the process ID).

       -jfilename
              Inform grohtml to split the html output into multiple files.  The
              filename is the stem and specified section headings (default is
              level one) start a new file, named filename-n.html.

       -l     Turn off the production of automatic section links at the top of
              the document.

       -n     Generate simple heading anchors whenever a section/number heading
              is found.  Without the option the anchor value is the textual
              heading.  This can cause problems when a heading contains a `?' on
              older versions of some browsers (Netscape).  This flag is
              automatically turned on if a heading contains an image.

       -overtical-offset
              Specify the vertical offset of images in points.

       -p     Display page rendering progress to stderr.  grohtml only displays
              a page number when an image is required.

       -r     Turn off the automatic header and footer line (html rule).

       -s size
              Set the base point size of the source file.  Thereafter when this
              point size is used in the source it will correspond to the html
              base size.  Every increase of two points in the source will yield
              a <big> tag, and conversely when a decrease of two points is seen
              a <small> tag is emitted.

       -Slevel
              When splitting html output, split at the heading level (or higher)
              defined by level.

       -v     Print the version number.

USAGE
       There are styles called R, I, B, and BI mounted at font positions 1 to 4.

DEPENDENCIES
       grohtml is dependent upon the png utilities (pnmcut, pnmcrop, pnmtopng)
       and GhostScript (gs).  pnmtopng (version 2.37.6 or greater) and pnmcut
       from the netpbm package (version 9.16 or greater) will work also.  It is
       also dependent upon psselect from the PSUtils package.  Images are
       generated whenever a table, picture, equation or line is encountered.

BUGS
       Grohtml has been completely redesigned and rewritten.  It is still beta
       code.
