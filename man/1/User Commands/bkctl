bkctl(1)                     General Commands Manual                    bkctl(1)

NAME
     bkctl â€“ Uses BookKit.framework to manage the iBooks book library

SYNOPSIS
     bkctl [subcommand [arguments ...]]

DESCRIPTION
     bkctl uses BookKit.framework to list, import, and remove books in the
     iBooks library.  bkctl supports a number of subcommands on the command
     line.

SUBCOMMANDS
     list     Lists the paths of all of the currently installed (uncompressed)
              {.epub, .ibooks, .pdf} books in the book library.

     rebuild  Performs a consistency check of the book library. All books in
              Books.plist must exist as book files/directories. All books in the
              Books directory must have an entry in Books.plist. All book files
              must be named <assetID>.{epub,ibooks,pdf}. This command ensures
              that those requirements are maintained. This can be used to
              recover lost books.

     import paths ...
              Imports one or more book files into the book library. The paths
              may point to individual books files, or to directories containing
              book files, which will be recursively scanned for
              {.epub,.ibooks,.pdf} files.

     remove paths ...
              Removes one or more book files from the book library. Paths must
              refer to books currently in the book library.

     shutdown
              Shuts down the BookKit.framework XPC service. Use this when you
              need to update BookKit.framework from an installer or when using
              darwinup.

DIRECTORIES & FILES
     ~/Library/Application Support/iBooks/Books
                                    Directory containing installed book
                                    files/directories.
     ~/Library/Application Support/iBooks/Books.plist
                                    Binary property list file containing the
                                    known installed books.
