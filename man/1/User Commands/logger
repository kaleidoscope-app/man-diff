LOGGER(1)                    General Commands Manual                   LOGGER(1)

NAME
     logger – make entries in the system log

SYNOPSIS
     logger [-is] [-f file] [-p pri] [-t tag] [message ...]

DESCRIPTION
     Logger provides a shell command interface to the syslog(3) system log
     module.

     Options:

     -i       Log the process id of the logger process with each line.

     -s       Log the message to standard error, as well as the system log.

     -f file  Log the specified file.

     -p pri   Enter the message with the specified priority.  The priority may
              be specified numerically or as a ``facility.level'' pair.  For
              example, ``-p local3.info'' logs the message(s) as informational
              level in the local3 facility.  The default is ``user.notice.''

     -t tag   Mark every line in the log with the specified tag.

     message  Write the message to log; if not specified, and the -f flag is not
              provided, standard input is logged.

     The logger utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
           logger System rebooted

           logger -p local0.notice -t HOSTIDM -f /dev/idmc
