DESCRIPTION
       The postmulti(1) command allows a Postfix administrator to manage
       multiple Postfix instances on a single host.

       postmulti(1) implements two fundamental modes of operation.  In iterator
       mode, it executes the same command for multiple Postfix instances.  In
       life-cycle management mode, it adds or deletes one instance, or changes
       the multi-instance status of one instance.

       Each mode of operation has its own command syntax. For this reason, each
       mode is documented in separate sections below.

BACKGROUND
       A multi-instance configuration consists of one primary Postfix instance,
       and one or more secondary instances whose configuration directory
       pathnames are recorded in the primary instance's main.cf file. Postfix
       instances share program files and documentation, but have their own
       configuration, queue and data directories.

       Currently, only the default Postfix instance can be used as primary
       instance in a multi-instance configuration. The postmulti(1) command does
       not currently support a -c option to select an alternative primary
       instance, and exits with a fatal error if the MAIL_CONFIG environment
       variable is set to a non-default configuration directory.

       See the MULTI_INSTANCE_README tutorial for a more detailed discussion of
       multi-instance management with postmulti(1).

ITERATOR MODE
       In iterator mode, postmulti performs the same operation on all Postfix
       instances in turn.

       If multi-instance support is not enabled, the requested command is
       performed just for the primary instance.

       Iterator mode implements the following command options:

Instance selection
       -a     Perform the operation on all instances. This is the default.

       -g group
              Perform the operation only for members of the named group.

       -i name
              Perform the operation only for the instance with the specified
              name.  You can specify either the instance name or the absolute
              pathname of the instance's configuration directory.  Specify "-"
              to select the primary Postfix instance.

       -R     Reverse the iteration order. This may be appropriate when updating
              a multi-instance system, where "sink" instances are started before
              "source" instances.

              This option cannot be used with -p.

List mode
       -l     List Postfix instances with their instance name, instance group
              name, enable/disable status and configuration directory.

Postfix-wrapper mode
       -p postfix-command
              Invoke postfix(1) to execute postfix-command.  This option
              implements the postfix-wrapper(5) interface.

              •      With "start"-like commands, "postfix check" is executed for
                     instances that are not enabled. The full list of commands
                     is specified with the postmulti_start_commands parameter.

              •      With "stop"-like commands, the iteration order is reversed,
                     and disabled instances are skipped. The full list of
                     commands is specified with the postmulti_stop_commands
                     parameter.

              •      With "reload" and other commands that require a started
                     instance, disabled instances are skipped. The full list of
                     commands is specified with the postmulti_control_commands
                     parameter.

              •      With "status" and other commands that don't require a
                     started instance, the command is executed for all
                     instances.

              The -p option can also be used interactively to start/stop/etc.  a
              named instance or instance group. For example, to start just the
              instances in the group "msa", invoke postmulti(1) as follows:

                     # postmulti -g msa -p start

Command mode
       -x unix-command
              Execute the specified unix-command for all Postfix instances.  The
              command runs with appropriate environment settings for
              MAIL_CONFIG, command_directory, daemon_directory,
              config_directory, queue_directory, data_directory,
              multi_instance_name, multi_instance_group and
              multi_instance_enable.

Other options
       -v     Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple -v options
              make the software increasingly verbose.

LIFE-CYCLE MANAGEMENT MODE
       With the -e option postmulti(1) can be used to add or delete a Postfix
       instance, and to manage the multi-instance status of an existing
       instance.

       The following options are implemented:

Existing instance selection
       -a     When creating or importing an instance, place the new instance at
              the front of the secondary instance list.

       -g group
              When creating or importing an instance, place the new instance
              before the first secondary instance that is a member of the
              specified group.

       -i name
              When creating or importing an instance, place the new instance
              before the matching secondary instance.

              With other life-cycle operations, apply the operation to the named
              existing instance.  Specify "-" to select the primary Postfix
              instance.

New or existing instance name assignment
       -I name
              Assign the specified instance name to an existing instance,
              newly-created instance, or imported instance.  Instance names
              other than "-" (which makes the instance "nameless") must start
              with "postfix-".  This restriction reduces the likelihood of name
              collisions with system files.

       -G group
              Assign the specified group name to an existing instance or to a
              newly created or imported instance.

Instance creation/deletion/status change
       -e action
              "Edit" managed instances. The following actions are supported:

              init   This command is required before postmulti(1) can be used to
                     manage Postfix instances.  The "postmulti -e init" command
                     updates the primary instance's main.cf file by setting:

                            multi_instance_wrapper =
                                    ${command_directory}/postmulti -p --
                            multi_instance_enable = yes

                     You can set these by other means if you prefer.

              create Create a new Postfix instance and add it to the
                     multi_instance_directories parameter of the primary
                     instance.  The "-I name" option is recommended to give the
                     instance a short name that is used to construct default
                     values for the private directories of the new instance. The
                     "-G group" option may be specified to assign the instance
                     to a group, otherwise, the new instance is not a member of
                     any groups.

                     The new instance main.cf is the stock main.cf with the
                     parameters that specify the locations of shared files
                     cloned from the primary instance.  For "nameless"
                     instances, you should manually adjust "syslog_name" to
                     yield a unique "logtag" starting with "postfix-" that will
                     uniquely identify the instance in the mail logs. It is
                     simpler to assign the instance a short name with the "-I
                     name" option.

                     Optional "name=value" arguments specify the instance
                     config_directory, queue_directory and data_directory.  For
                     example:

                            # postmulti -I postfix-mumble \
                                    -G mygroup -e create \
                                    config_directory=/my/config/dir \
                                    queue_directory=/my/queue/dir \
                                    data_directory=/my/data/dir

                     If any of these pathnames is not supplied, the program
                     attempts to generate the pathname by taking the
                     corresponding primary instance pathname, and by replacing
                     the last pathname component by the value of the -I option.

                     If the instance configuration directory already exists, and
                     contains both a main.cf and master.cf file, create will
                     "import" the instance as-is. For existing instances, create
                     and import are identical.

              import Import an existing instance into the list of instances
                     managed by the postmulti(1) multi-instance manager.  This
                     adds the instance to the multi_instance_directories list of
                     the primary instance.  If the "-I name" option is provided
                     it specifies the new name for the instance and is used to
                     define a default location for the instance configuration
                     directory (as with create above).  The "-G group" option
                     may be used to assign the instance to a group. Add a
                     "config_directory=/path" argument to override a default
                     pathname based on "-I name".

              destroy
                     Destroy a secondary Postfix instance. To be a candidate for
                     destruction an instance must be disabled, stopped and its
                     queue must not contain any messages. Attempts to destroy
                     the primary Postfix instance trigger a fatal error, without
                     destroying the instance.

                     The instance is removed from the primary instance main.cf
                     file's alternate_config_directories parameter and its data,
                     queue and configuration directories are cleaned of files
                     and directories created by the Postfix system. The main.cf
                     and master.cf files are removed from the configuration
                     directory even if they have been modified since initial
                     creation. Finally, the instance is "deported" from the list
                     of managed instances.

                     If other files are present in instance private directories,
                     the directories may not be fully removed, a warning is
                     logged to alert the administrator. It is expected that an
                     instance built using "fresh" directories via the create
                     action will be fully removed by the destroy action (if
                     first disabled). If the instance configuration and queue
                     directories are populated with additional files (access and
                     rewriting tables, chroot jail content, etc.) the instance
                     directories will not be fully removed.

                     The destroy action triggers potentially dangerous file
                     removal operations. Make sure the instance's data, queue
                     and configuration directories are set correctly and do not
                     contain any valuable files.

              deport Deport a secondary instance from the list of managed
                     instances. This deletes the instance configuration
                     directory from the primary instance's
                     multi_instance_directories list, but does not remove any
                     files or directories.

              assign Assign a new instance name or a new group name to the
                     selected instance.  Use "-G -" to specify "no group" and
                     "-I -" to specify "no name".  If you choose to make an
                     instance "nameless", set a suitable syslog_name in the
                     corresponding main.cf file.

              enable Mark the selected instance as enabled. This just sets the
                     multi_instance_enable parameter to "yes" in the instance's
                     main.cf file.

              disable
                     Mark the selected instance as disabled. This means that the
                     instance will not be started etc. with "postfix start",
                     "postmulti -p start" and so on. The instance can still be
                     started etc. with "postfix -c config-directory start".

Other options
       -v     Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple -v options
              make the software increasingly verbose.

ENVIRONMENT
       The postmulti(1) command exports the following environment variables
       before executing the requested command for a given instance:
