DESCRIPTION

     followed by a newline.

     The logname utility explicitly ignores the LOGNAME and USER environment
     variables because the environment cannot be trusted.

EXIT STATUS
     The logname utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

SEE ALSO
     who(1), whoami(1), getlogin(2)

STANDARDS
     The logname utility is expected to conform to IEEE Std 1003.2 (“POSIX.2”).

HISTORY
     The logname command appeared in 4.4BSD.
