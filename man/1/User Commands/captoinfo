NAME
       captoinfo - convert a termcap description into a terminfo description

SYNOPSIS
       captoinfo [-vn width]  [-V] [-1] [-w width] file . . .

DESCRIPTION
       captoinfo looks in file for termcap descriptions.  For each one found, an
       equivalent terminfo description is written to standard output.  Termcap
       tc capabilities are translated directly to terminfo use capabilities.

       If no file is given, then the environment variable TERMCAP is used for
       the filename or entry.  If TERMCAP is a full pathname to a file, only the
       terminal whose name is specified in the environment variable TERM is
       extracted from that file.  If the environment variable TERMCAP is not
       set, then the file /usr/share/terminfo is read.

       -v   print out tracing information on standard error as the program runs.

       -V   print out the version of the program in use on standard error and
            exit.

       -1   cause the fields to print out one to a line.  Otherwise, the fields
            will be printed several to a line to a maximum width of 60
            characters.

       -w   change the output to width characters.

FILES
       /usr/share/terminfo Compiled terminal description database.

TRANSLATIONS FROM NONSTANDARD CAPABILITIES
       Some obsolete nonstandard capabilities will automatically be translated
       into standard (SVr4/XSI Curses) terminfo capabilities by captoinfo.
       Whenever one of these automatic translations is done, the program will
       issue an notification to stderr, inviting the user to check that it has
       not mistakenly translated a completely unknown and random capability
       and/or syntax error.

       XENIX termcap also used to have a set of extension capabilities for forms
       drawing, designed to take advantage of the IBM PC high-half graphics.
       They were as follows:

       Cap          Graphic
       ─────────────────────────────
       G2    upper left
       G3    lower left
       G1    upper right
       G4    lower right
       GR    pointing right
       GL    pointing left
       GU    pointing up
       GD    pointing down
       GH    horizontal line
       GV    vertical line
       GC    intersection
       G6    upper left
       G7    lower left
       G5    upper right
       G8    lower right
       Gr    tee pointing right
       Gr    tee pointing left
       Gu    tee pointing up
       Gd    tee pointing down
       Gh    horizontal line
       Gv    vertical line
       Gc    intersection
       GG    acs magic cookie count

       If the single-line capabilities occur in an entry, they will
       automatically be composed into an acsc string.  The double-line
       capabilities and GG are discarded with a warning message.

       IBM's AIX has a terminfo facility descended from SVr1 terminfo but
       incompatible with the SVr4 format. The following AIX extensions are
       automatically translated:

        IBM    XSI
       ─────────────
       ksel    kslt
       kbtab   kcbt
       font0   s0ds
       font1   s1ds
       font2   s2ds
       font3   s3ds

       Additionally, the AIX box1 capability will be automatically translated to
       an acsc string.

       Hewlett-Packard's terminfo library supports two nonstandard terminfo
       capabilities meml (memory lock) and memu (memory unlock).  These will be
       discarded with a warning message.

NOTES
       This utility is actually a link to tic(1M), running in -I mode.  You can
       use other tic options such as -f and  -x.

       The trace option is not identical to SVr4's.  Under SVr4, instead of
       following the -v with a trace level n, you repeat it n times.

       This describes ncurses version 5.7 (patch 20081102).
