SNMPSTATUS(1)                       Net-SNMP                       SNMPSTATUS(1)



NAME
       snmpstatus - retrieves a fixed set of management information from a
       network entity

SYNOPSIS
       snmpstatus [COMMON OPTIONS] [-Cf] AGENT

DESCRIPTION
       snmpstatus is an SNMP application that retrieves several important
       statistics from a network entity.

       AGENT identifies a target SNMP agent, which is instrumented to monitor
       the given objects.  At its simplest, the AGENT specification will consist
       of a hostname or an IPv4 address.  n this situation, the command will
       attempt communication with the agent, using UDP/IPv4 to port 161 of the
       given target host.

       See the snmpcmd(1) manual page for a full list of the possible formats
       for AGENT.

       The information returned is:

              The IP address of the entity.
              A textual description of the entity (sysDescr.0)
              The uptime of the entity's SNMP agent (sysUpTime.0)
              The sum of received packets on all interfaces (ifInUCastPkts.* +
              ifInNUCastPkts.*)
              The sum of transmitted packets on all interfaces (ifOutUCastPkts.*
              + ifOutNUCastPkts.*)
              The number of IP input packets (ipInReceives.0)
              The number of IP output packets (ipOutRequests.0)

       For example:

       snmpstatus -c public -v 1 netdev-kbox.cc.cmu.edu

       will produce output similar to the following:

       [128.2.56.220]=>[Kinetics FastPath2] Up: 1 day, 4:43:31
       Interfaces: 1,  Recv/Trans packets: 262874/39867 | IP: 31603/15805

       snmpstatus also checks the operational status of all interfaces
       (ifOperStatus.*), and if it finds any that are not running, it will
       report in a manner similar to this:

       2 interfaces are down!

       If the network entity has an error processing the request packet, an
       error packet will be returned and a message will be shown, helping to
       pinpoint in what way the request was malformed.  snmpstatus will attempt
       to reform its request to eliminate the malformed variable (unless the -Cf
       option is given, see below), but this variable will then be missing from
       the displayed data.

OPTIONS
       COMMON OPTIONS
              Please see snmpcmd(1) for a list of possible values for COMMON
              OPTIONS as well as their descriptions.

       -Cf    By default, snmpstatus will try to fix errors returned by the
              agent and retry a request. In this situation, the command will
              display the data that it can. If the -Cf option is specified, then
              snmpstatus will not try to fix errors, and the error will cause
              the command to terminate.
