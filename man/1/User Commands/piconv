PICONV(1)               Perl Programmers Reference Guide               PICONV(1)




NAME
       piconv -- iconv(1), reinvented in perl

SYNOPSIS
         piconv [-f from_encoding] [-t to_encoding]
                [-p|--perlqq|--htmlcref|--xmlcref] [-C N|-c] [-D] [-S scheme]
                [-s string|file...]
         piconv -l
         piconv -r encoding_alias
         piconv -h

DESCRIPTION
       piconv is perl version of iconv, a character encoding converter widely
       available for various Unixen today.  This script was primarily a
       technology demonstrator for Perl 5.8.0, but you can use piconv in the
       place of iconv for virtually any case.

       piconv converts the character encoding of either STDIN or files specified
       in the argument and prints out to STDOUT.

       Here is the list of options.  Some options can be in short format (-f) or
       long (--from) one.

       -f,--from from_encoding
           Specifies the encoding you are converting from.  Unlike iconv, this
           option can be omitted.  In such cases, the current locale is used.

       -t,--to to_encoding
           Specifies the encoding you are converting to.  Unlike iconv, this
           option can be omitted.  In such cases, the current locale is used.

           Therefore, when both -f and -t are omitted, piconv just acts like
           cat.

       -s,--string string
           uses string instead of file for the source of text.

       -l,--list
           Lists all available encodings, one per line, in case-insensitive
           order.  Note that only the canonical names are listed; many aliases
           exist.  For example, the names are case-insensitive, and many
           standard and common aliases work, such as "latin1" for "ISO-8859-1",
           or "ibm850" instead of "cp850", or "winlatin1" for "cp1252".  See
           Encode::Supported for a full discussion.

       -r,--resolve encoding_alias
           Resolve encoding_alias to Encode canonical encoding name.

       -C,--check N
           Check the validity of the stream if N = 1.  When N = -1, something
           interesting happens when it encounters an invalid character.

       -c  Same as "-C 1".

       -p,--perlqq
           Transliterate characters missing in encoding to \x{HHHH} where HHHH
           is the hexadecimal Unicode code point.

       --htmlcref
           Transliterate characters missing in encoding to &#NNN; where NNN is
           the decimal Unicode code point.

       --xmlcref
           Transliterate characters missing in encoding to &#xHHHH; where HHHH
           is the hexadecimal Unicode code point.

       -h,--help
           Show usage.

       -D,--debug
           Invokes debugging mode.  Primarily for Encode hackers.

       -S,--scheme scheme
           Selects which scheme is to be used for conversion.  Available schemes
           are as follows:

           from_to
               Uses Encode::from_to for conversion.  This is the default.

           decode_encode
               Input strings are decode()d then encode()d.  A straight two-step
               implementation.

           perlio
               The new perlIO layer is used.  NI-S' favorite.

               You should use this option if you are using UTF-16 and others
               which linefeed is not $/.

           Like the -D option, this is also for Encode hackers.
