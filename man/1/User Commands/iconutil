NAME
     iconutil â€“ Utility to convert between '.iconset' and '.icns' files.

SYNOPSIS
     iconutil -c {icns | iconset} [-o file] file [icon-name]

DESCRIPTION
     iconutil converts between '.iconset' and '.icns' files, and can extract
     icons from '.car' asset catalog files. The tool takes a single source
     '.icns' file, '.iconset' or a '.car' file and icon name. It converts the
     input to either a '.icns' or '.iconset' depending on the value of the -c
     flag's argument.  It is possible to specify the name of the output file by
     passing the file path as the argument to the -o flag. If -o is not set
     iconutil will write converted '.icns' file or '.iconset' to the same
     directory as the source file using either the name of the icon in the
     '.car' or the input file name with the extension derived from the output
     type.

OPTIONS
     -c --convert {icns | iconset}
              Given the argument iconset, iconutil converts the source '.icns'
              file to an '.iconset'.  The '.iconset' is saved in the same
              directory as the source '.icns'. It is given a file name derived
              from the input file name or the input icon name with the
              '.iconset' file extension.  If the argument is icns, iconutil
              converts the source '.iconset' to an '.icns'.  The '.icns' is
              saved in the same directory as the source '.iconset'. It is given
              a file name derived from the input file name or the input icon
              name with the '.iconset' file extension.

     -o --output
              Overrides the default output file name that iconutil uses to save
              the converted '.iconset' or '.icns' files.
