NAME
     pgrep, pkill – find or signal processes by name

SYNOPSIS
     pgrep [-Lafilnoqvx] [-F pidfile] [-G gid] [-P ppid] [-U uid] [-d delim]
           [-g pgrp] [-t tty] [-u euid] pattern ...
     pkill [-signal] [-ILafilnovx] [-F pidfile] [-G gid] [-P ppid] [-U uid]
           [-g pgrp] [-t tty] [-u euid] pattern ...

DESCRIPTION
     The pgrep command searches the process table on the running system and
     prints the process IDs of all processes that match the criteria given on
     the command line.

     The pkill command searches the process table on the running system and
     signals all processes that match the criteria given on the command line.

     The following options are available:

     -F pidfile        Restrict matches to a process whose PID is stored in the
                       pidfile file.

     -G gid            Restrict matches to processes with a real group ID in the
                       comma-separated list gid.

     -I                Request confirmation before attempting to signal each
                       process.

     -L                The pidfile file given for the -F option must be locked
                       with the flock(2) syscall or created with pidfile(3).

     -P ppid           Restrict matches to processes with a parent process ID in
                       the comma-separated list ppid.

     -S                Search also in system processes (kernel threads).

     -U uid            Restrict matches to processes with a real user ID in the
                       comma-separated list uid.

     -d delim          Specify a delimiter to be printed between each process
                       ID.  The default is a newline.  This option can only be
                       used with the pgrep command.

     -a                Include process ancestors in the match list.  By default,
                       the current pgrep or pkill process and all of its
                       ancestors are excluded (unless -v is used).

     -f                Match against full argument lists.  The default is to
                       match against process names.

     -g pgrp           Restrict matches to processes with a process group ID in
                       the comma-separated list pgrp.  The value zero is taken
                       to mean the process group ID of the running pgrep or
                       pkill command.

     -i                Ignore case distinctions in both the process table and
                       the supplied pattern.

     -l                Long output.  For pgrep, print the process name in
                       addition to the process ID for each matching process.  If
                       used in conjunction with -f, print the process ID and the
                       full argument list for each matching process.  For pkill,
                       display the kill command used for each process killed.

     -n                Select only the newest (most recently started) of the
                       matching processes.

     -o                Select only the oldest (least recently started) of the
                       matching processes.

     -q                For pgrep, Do not write anything to standard output.

     -t tty            Restrict matches to processes associated with a terminal
                       in the comma-separated list tty.  Terminal names may be
                       of the form ttyxx or the shortened form xx.  A single
                       dash (‘-’) matches processes not associated with a
                       terminal.

     -u euid           Restrict matches to processes with an effective user ID
                       in the comma-separated list euid.

     -v                Reverse the sense of the matching; display processes that
                       do not match the given criteria.

     -x                Require an exact match of the process name, or argument
                       list if -f is given.  The default is to match any
                       substring.

     -signal           A non-negative decimal number or symbolic signal name
                       specifying the signal to be sent instead of the default
                       TERM.  This option is valid only when given as the first
                       argument to pkill.

     If any pattern operands are specified, they are used as extended regular
     expressions to match the command name or full argument list of each
     process.

     Note that a running pgrep or pkill process will never consider itself as a
     potential match.

EXIT STATUS
     The pgrep and pkill utilities return one of the following values upon exit:

     0       One or more processes were matched.

     1       No processes were matched.

     2       Invalid options were specified on the command line.

     3       An internal error occurred.

EXAMPLES
     Show the pid of the process holding the /tmp/.X0-lock pid file:

           $ pgrep -F /tmp/.X0-lock
           1211

     Show the pid and the name of the process including kernel threads in the
     search:

           $ pgrep -lS vnlru
           37 vnlru

     Search for processes including kernel threads that match the extended
     regular expression pattern:

           $ pgrep -S 'crypto.*[2-3]'
           20
           19
           6
           5

     Show long output for firefox processes:

           $ pgrep -l firefox
           1312 firefox
           1309 firefox
           1288 firefox
           1280 firefox
           1279 firefox
           1278 firefox
           1277 firefox
           1264 firefox

     Same as above but just showing the pid of the most recent process:

           $ pgrep -n firefox
           1312

     Look for vim processes.  Match against the full argument list:

           $ pgrep -f vim
           44968
           30790

     Same as above but matching against the ‘list’ word and showing the full
     argument list:

           $ pgrep -f -l list
           30790 vim list.txt

     Send SIGSTOP signal to processes that are an exact match:

           $ pkill -SIGSTOP -f -x "vim list.txt"

     Without -f names over 19 characters will silently fail:

           $ vim this_is_a_very_long_file_name &
           [1] 36689
           $

           [1]+  Stopped                 vim this_is_a_very_long_file_name
           $ pgrep "vim this"
           $

     Same as above using the -f flag:

           $ pgrep -f "vim this"
           36689

HISTORY
     The pkill and pgrep utilities first appeared in NetBSD 1.6.  They are
     modelled after utilities of the same name that appeared in Sun Solaris 7.
     They made their first appearance in FreeBSD 5.3.
