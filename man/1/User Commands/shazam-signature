SHAZAM-SIGNATURE(1)          General Commands Manual         SHAZAM-SIGNATURE(1)



NAME
     shazam signature â€“ Create shazam signature files from media


SYNOPSIS
     shazam signature [--input input] [--output output]



DESCRIPTION
     This command is used for generating a shazam signature file from a media
     input. The media can either be an audio or video file type. If the input is
     an audio file, the audio is converted into a shazam signature and saved to
     a specified output location. If the input is a video file, the video file
     has its audio extracted and converted to a shazam signature file.


OPTIONS
     -i,--input input
             Path to an audio or video file to generate a shazam signature from.


     -o,--output output
             Path to save the new shazam signature file. If output is a
             directory, the shazam signature is created in that directory with
             the same name as the input file. If output is not specified, the
             shazam signature is saved in the current working directory with the
             same name as the input file.
