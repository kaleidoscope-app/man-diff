ZMORE(1)                     General Commands Manual                    ZMORE(1)

NAME
     zmore, zless – view compressed files

SYNOPSIS
     zmore [flags] [file ...]
     zless [flags] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     zmore is a filter that allows the viewing of files compressed with Lempel-
     Ziv encoding.  Such files generally have a “Z” or “gz” extension (both the
     compress(1) and gzip(1) formats are supported).  Any flags that are
     specified are passed to the user's preferred PAGER (which is /usr/bin/more
     by default).

     zless is equivalent to zmore but uses less(1) as a pager instead of
     more(1).

     When multiple files are specified, zmore will pause at the end of each file
     and present the following prompt to the user:

           prev_file (END) - Next: next_file

     Where prev_file is the file that was just displayed and next_file is the
     next file to be displayed.  The following keys are recognized at the
     prompt:

           e or q  quit zmore.

           s       skip the next file (or exit if the next file is the last).

     If no files are specified, zmore will read from the standard input.  In
     this mode zmore will assume gzip(1) style compression since there is no
     suffix on which to make a decision.

ENVIRONMENT
     PAGER  Program used to display files.  If unset, /usr/bin/more is used
            (zmore) or /usr/bin/less (zless).
