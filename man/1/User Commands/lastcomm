LASTCOMM(1)                  General Commands Manual                 LASTCOMM(1)

NAME
     lastcomm – show last commands executed in reverse order

SYNOPSIS
     lastcomm [-f file] [command ...] [user ...] [terminal ...]

DESCRIPTION
     lastcomm gives information on previously executed commands.  With no
     arguments, lastcomm prints information about all the commands recorded
     during the current accounting file's lifetime.

     Option:

     -f file     Read from file rather than the default accounting file.

     If called with arguments, only accounting entries with a matching command
     name, user name, or terminal name are printed.  So, for example:

           lastcomm a.out root ttyd0

     would produce a listing of all the executions of commands named a.out by
     user root on the terminal ttyd0.

     For each process entry, the following are printed.

           •   The name of the user who ran the process.
           •   Flags, as accumulated by the accounting facilities in the system.
           •   The command name under which the process was called.
           •   The amount of cpu time used by the process (in seconds).
           •   The time the process started.
           •   The elapsed time of the process.

     The flags are encoded as follows: “S” indicates the command was executed by
     the super-user, “F” indicates the command ran after a fork, but without a
     following exec(3), “C” indicates the command was run in PDP-11
     compatibility mode (VAX only), “D” indicates the command terminated with
     the generation of a core file, and “X” indicates the command was terminated
     with a signal.

FILES
     /var/account/acct  Default accounting file.
