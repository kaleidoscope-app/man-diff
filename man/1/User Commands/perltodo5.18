NAME
       perltodo - Perl TO-DO List

DESCRIPTION
       We no longer install the Perl 5 to-do list as a manpage, as installing
       snapshot that becomes increasingly out of date isn't that useful to
       anyone.  The current Perl 5 to-do list is maintained in the git
       repository, and can be viewed at
       <http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/blob/HEAD:/Porting/todo.pod>
