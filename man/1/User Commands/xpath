XPATH(1)               User Contributed Perl Documentation              XPATH(1)




NAME
       xpath - a script to query XPath statements in XML documents.

SYNOPSIS
       xpath [-s suffix] [-p prefix] [-n] [-q] -e query [-e query] ... [file]
       ...

DESCRIPTION
       xpath uses the XML::XPath perl module to make XPath queries to any XML
       document.  The XML::XPath module aims to comply exactly to the XPath
       specification at "http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath" and yet allows extensions
       to be added in the form of functions.

       The script takes any number of XPath pointers and tries to apply them to
       each XML document given on the command line. If no file arguments are
       given, the query is done using "STDIN" as an XML document.

       When multiple queries exist, the result of the last query is used as
       context for the next query and only the result of the last one is output.
       The context of the first query is always the root of the current
       document.

OPTIONS
   -q
       Be quiet. Output only errors (and no separator) on stderr.

   -n
       Never use an external DTD, ie. instantiate the XML::Parser module with
       'ParseParamEnt => 0'.

   -s suffix
       Place "suffix" at the end of each entry. Default is a linefeed.

   -p prefix
       Place "prefix" preceding each entry. Default is nothing.
