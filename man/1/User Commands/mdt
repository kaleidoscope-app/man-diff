NAME
       mdt - Metadata performance test

SYNOPSIS
       mdt [options] path [path...]

DESCRIPTION
       mdt is a utility that can be used to measure the relative metadata
       performance of a given file system(s).  By default, mdt measures
       creates/second and removes/second.  Optionally mdt will also measure the
       per second rates for stat, chmod, and move (rename) operations.

       Each path specified on the command line corresponds to a mount point for
       a file system to be tested.  By default, mdt will start 8 pthreads.  Each
       pthread will make a directory and create 16384 files in the directory.
       The number of pthreads (directories) can be specified via the -n option,
       and the number of file per directory can be specified via the -f option.

       mdt is a metadata only test and no writes or reads are done.  By default
       files are zero length.  For a StorNext file system, space may be
       allocated to the file via the -b option which performs a StorNext API
       CvApi_VerifyAlloc call.  Be aware that allocating space to files in this
       manner is not reflected in the file size.

       On completion, mdt will print the number of files and rates for the
       specified metadata requests in the form of operations/second.  The -v
       option will expand output listing per stream detail.

       Unless the -R option is specified, mdt will remove all created files and
       directories in the remove test section.

       For StorNext file systems, mdt will unmount and then mount the target
       file systems between test sections in order to clear the client metadata
       cache.  Targeted file systems should not be busy as to prevent
       remounting.  The -U option will cause mdt to bypass remounting between
       test sections.

OPTIONS
       -?     Display usage.

       -a     Run all test sections.  In addition to create and remove, rates
              for stat, chmod, move (rename) are also measured.

       -b prealloc_size_in_bytes
              Specify the size in bytes to preallocate after creating a file.
              The default is 0 bytes and no preallocate.

              Optionally, a single letter suffix can represent bytes in units.
              mdt single letter unit suffixes are as follows.

                 k    KB   10^3              1,000
                 m    MB   10^6          1,000,000
                 b    GB   10^9      1,000,000,000
                 K    KiB  2^10              1,024
                 M    MiB  2^20          1,048,576
                 B    GiB  2^30      1,073,741,824


       -C     Do not create files.  This option requires that a create run was
              done at some previous time and the files were not removed.  See
              the -R option.

       -c     Run the chmod test section.

       -d[dd] Run in debug mode. The more "d's" specified, the more debug
              information is printed.

       -E csv_file
              Create and write results to the specified .csv file. A .csv file,
              (comma separated value) is a file that can be consumed by a
              spreadsheet application like Microsoft Excel.

       -e csv_file
              Write results to the specified .csv file; one that can be read by
              Microsoft Excel or other spreadsheet application. Data is appended
              to the specified csv file which must exist.  See the -E option.

       -f number_of_files
              Specify the number of files per directory.  Optionally a single
              letter suffix can be provided.  See the -b option for suffix
              detail.

       -F fsname
              Specify the name of the file system to use on the remount. The
              file system name returned by the mount command varies by operating
              system. If you have trouble with remounts, you may have to specify
              the file system name.

       -m     Run the move/rename test section.  Files are renamed in within
              their parent directories.

       -n number_of_directories
              The specified number of directories are created.  Each will
              contain the number of files specified by the -f option.  A pthread
              is created for each directory to execute the designated
              operations.

       -R     Skip the remove section and leave the files in place.

       -s     Run the stat test section.  This section will execute readdir
              operations and stat each file in each directory; the equivalent of
              an ls -l command.

       -T tag_string
              Write the specified tag string to the standard output and to the
              csv file if the option to write a csv file is selected.  This can
              be used to stamp results with a name identifying a given test
              scenario.

       -U     Do not unmount and remount the file system between test sections.

       -v     Print verbose output.  The result for each stream is reported.

       -V     Print the mdt version information and exit.

NOTES
       The number of files (-f) and directories (-n) are per file system.

       The number of pthreads (streams) that are run in each file systems
       corresponds to the number of directories specified.

       Other than #files, the output values represent metadata
       operations/second.
