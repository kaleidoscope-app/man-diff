NAME
       perlfreebsd - Perl version 5 on FreeBSD systems

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes various features of FreeBSD that will affect how
       Perl version 5 (hereafter just Perl) is compiled and/or runs.

   FreeBSD core dumps from readdir_r with ithreads
       When perl is configured to use ithreads, it will use re-entrant library
       calls in preference to non-re-entrant versions.  There is a bug in
       FreeBSD's "readdir_r" function in versions 4.5 and earlier that can cause
       a SEGV when reading large directories. A patch for FreeBSD libc is
       available (see <http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=misc/30631> )
       which has been integrated into FreeBSD 4.6.

   $^X doesn't always contain a full path in FreeBSD
       perl sets $^X where possible to a full path by asking the operating
       system. On FreeBSD the full path of the perl interpreter is found by
       using "sysctl" with "KERN_PROC_PATHNAME" if that is supported, else by
       reading the symlink /proc/curproc/file. FreeBSD 7 and earlier has a bug
       where either approach sometimes returns an incorrect value (see
       <http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=35703> ).  In these cases
       perl will fall back to the old behaviour of using C's "argv[0]" value for
       $^X.
