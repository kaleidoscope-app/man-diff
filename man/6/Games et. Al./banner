BANNER(6)                         Games Manual                         BANNER(6)

NAME
     banner â€“ print large banner on printer

SYNOPSIS
     banner [-d] [-t] [-w width] message ...

DESCRIPTION
     Banner prints a large, high quality banner on the standard output.  If the
     message is omitted, it prompts for and reads one line of its standard
     input.

     The output should be printed on paper of the appropriate width, with no
     breaks between the pages.

     The following options are available:

     -d      Enable debug.

     -t      Enable trace.

     -w width
             Change the output from a width of 132 to width, suitable for a
             narrow terminal.

BUGS
     Several ASCII characters are not defined, notably <, >, [, ], \, ^, _, {,
     }, |, and ~.  Also, the characters ", ', and & are funny looking (but in a
     useful way.)

     The -w option is implemented by skipping some rows and columns.  The
     smaller it gets, the grainier the output.  Sometimes it runs letters
     together.

     Messages are limited to 1024 characters in length.
