NAME
     kdumpd â€“ Mac OS X remote kernel core dump server

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/libexec/kdumpd [directory]

DESCRIPTION
     Kdumpd is a server which receives kernel states in the form of a core dump
     from a remote Mac OS X machine.  The kdumpd server operates on UDP port
     1069, although this may be configurable in the future.  The server should
     be started by launchctl(1).

     The server should have the user ID with the lowest possible privilege,
     usually the user "nobody".

     By default the server stores kernel cores in the directory
     /var/tmp/PanicDumps.  The directory needs to already exist for kdumpd to
     save core dumps.

     The server returns an EEXIST error to the remote kernel if it receives a
     request for an existing file - i.e.  only new files can be created. The
     server also disallows path specifications in the incoming file name.

HISTORY
     The kdumpd command is based on Berkeley tftpd(8), by way of FreeBSD, with
     several modifications.
