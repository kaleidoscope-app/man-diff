NAME
       takeover_ip - broadcast virtual IP information for Xsan

SYNOPSIS
       /System/Library/Filesystems/acfs.fs/Contents/lib/takeover_ip
              -d_device_name -m_mac_address -i_ipv4_ip

DESCRIPTION
       takeover_ip provides a mechanism for sending a gratuitous arp reply when
       the secondary node in an HA pair takes over as primary and activates the
       configured virtual IPs (VIPs).

       This is typically used by the startup/shutdown scripts, not by an
       administrator.  Only use when recommended by Apple Support.
