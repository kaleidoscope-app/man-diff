XSANCTL(8)                   System Manager's Manual                  XSANCTL(8)

NAME
     xsanctl – Xsan file system control utility

SYNOPSYS
     xsanctl command [arg [...]]

DESCRIPTION
     xsanctl provides a basic control facility for the Xsan file system.  It
     operates by sending commands to the Xsan file system management daemon
     xsand.  xsanctl must be run by the superuser.

COMMANDS
     xsanctl provides the following commands:

   Primary commands
     These commands are the primary ones needed for SAN management.

     help         Display a list of the available xsanctl commands.

     ping         Sends a ‘ping’ message to xsand.  This can be used to verify
                  that xsand is responding to management requests.

     mount volumeName [options]
                  Creates the volume mount device for volume volumeName.  If any
                  mount options are given, xsand updates the local mount options
                  for the volume before creating the volume mount device.
                  diskarbitrationd will mount the volume after the volume mount
                  device is created.  This is the preferred method of mounting
                  Xsan volumes from the command line.

                  [options] include those options recognized by mount_acfs and
                  three others:

                  --at
                      Specify a non-standard path at which to mount the volume.

                  --rw
                      Mount the volume for both reading and writing. This
                  behavior is the default.

                  --ro
                      Mount the volume read-only.

                  --clusteriosize=size
                      Specify the maximum I/O transfer size (in bytes) that the
                  cluster layer can submit to the file system's IO strategy
                  routine. The minimum value allowed is 1MB and the maximum
                  value allowed is 32MB. The default value is set to 8MB when
                  the option is not specified.

                  mount_acfs options should be preceded by two dashes. For
                  instance, the number of kernel threads will increase to twenty
                  as a result of this option: --threads=20.

     unmount volumeName [options]
                  Unmounts the volume volumeName.

                  --force

                       Force the unmount. This operation may cause data loss

                  Previous versions of Xsan explicitly forced mounting of
                  selected volumes.  This version of Xsan creates volume mount
                  devices for all on-line and connected volumes and leaves mount
                  state control to disk arbitration.

     list         Displays a list of the available volumes.

     createSan sanName [createMaster arguments]
                  This subcommand must be run as root and does not depend on
                  xsand running.  This subcommand creates a new SAN with this
                  computer as the only controller. The SAN's name is sanName and
                  may not begin with a dash. This subcommand has two variants.
                  In both forms, it creates a new Xsan SAN. The subcommand's
                  behavior depends on the configuration state of Open Directory
                  when it runs.  Xsan controllers must be Open Directory
                  controllers for the cluster containing the SAN configuration.
                  If the computer is not an Open Directory controller this
                  subcommand configures the computer to be the master of a new
                  Open Directory cluster, and then creates the SAN using that
                  cluster.

                  The subcommand options supplied after the SAN name are
                  examined in the case where the computer is not an Open
                  Directory controller. In this case, they are processed as if
                  the createMaster subcommand had been run. In the case where
                  the computer is already an Open Directory controller, none of
                  the additional command options are valid.

     listSan      Displays a list of available Xsan SANs in the local network.
                  This subcommand does not depend on xsand running.

     joinSan sanName [options] [createReplica arguments]
                  This subcommand must be run as root and does not depend on
                  xsand running.  This subcommand joins this computer with an
                  existing SAN as a metadata controller. This computer will be
                  an additional metadata controller for an existing SAN. The
                  subcommand's behavior depends on the configuration state of
                  Open Directory when it runs.  Xsan controllers must be Open
                  Directory controllers for the cluster containing the SAN
                  configuration. If the computer is not an Open Directory
                  controller, this subcommand configures the computer to be a
                  replica in the Open Directory cluster, and then joins the SAN
                  using that cluster.

                  The subcommand options supplied after the joinSAN options are
                  examined in the case where the computer is not an Open
                  Directory controller. In this case, they are processed as if
                  the createReplica subcommand had been run. In the case where
                  the computer is already an Open Directory controller, none of
                  the additional createReplica command options are valid.

                  --controller-name ControllerName

                       Specify the metadata controller name in the SAN in which
                  this computer wants to join.

                  --controller-user ControllerUserName

                       Specify the administrator name for the metadata
                  controller in which this computer wants to join.

                  --controller-pass ControllerPassword

                       Specify the administrator password for the metadata
                  controller in which this computer wants to join.

     leaveSan     This subcommand must be run as root and does not depend on
                  xsand running.  This subcommand removes this computer as a
                  metadata controller from an existing SAN.

     removeControllerFromSan controllerName
                  This subcommand removes the specified computer as a metadata
                  controller from an existing SAN.

     destroySan   This subcommand must be run as root and does not depend on
                  xsand running.  This subcommand sets the SAN configuration for
                  this system's SAN to dead and updates the configuration in
                  LDAP. It also posts a configuration update message to the SAN.
                  Note: this command does NOT gracefully stop the SAN.
                  Controllers and clients may need to be rebooted if they do not
                  cleanly stop.  Use with care. This operation can not be
                  undone.

     exportClientProfile
                  Exports Xsan configuration profile which can be installed on
                  clients with Profile Manager.

                  --path dirPath

                       Specify the directory path in which the configuration
                  profile will be created. If this option is not selected, the
                  current working directory path will be used.

                  --output outputFile

                       Specify the file name to use for the configuration
                  profile. If this option is not selected, the name of the SAN
                  will be used as a default.

     addVolume volumeName [addOrEditVolumeOptions]
                  This subcommand creates a new volume named volumeName.  The
                  command options used to describe a new volume's format are
                  described in the VOLUME DESCRIPTION section below. The volume
                  will be hosted on all current controllers, and will be started
                  after creation. A new volume will consist of one or more
                  Storage pools.  One or more Storage pools must contain
                  metadata, One or more Storage pools must contain userdata, and
                  exactly one Storage pool must contain the journal.

     editVolume volumeName [addOrEditVolumeOptions]
                  This subcommand edits the settings for an existing volume
                  named volumeName.  The command options used to describe
                  volume's settings are described in the VOLUME DESCRIPTION
                  section below. Many of the volume settings set at addVolume
                  time may be subsequently changed. The ones which can not are
                  documented in that section. This subcommand can also add new
                  Storage pools to the volume.

     dropVolume [option] volumeName
                  Removes a volume from SAN. This subcommand must be run as
                  root. Note: the clients may need to be rebooted if '--force'
                  option fails to cleanly stop the clients.

                  --force

                       Force the deletion even the volume is still mounted by
                  the clients

     startVolume volumeName
                  Start the volume volumeName.  This subcommand must be run as
                  root.

     stopVolume [option] volumeName
                  Stops the volume volumeName.  Further operations to the volume
                  will be blocked in clients until the volume is started. This
                  subcommand must be run as root.

                  --force

                       Force the stop even the volume is still mounted by the
                  clients

     unloadProfile
                  This subcommand must be run as root and does not depend on
                  xsand running. This subcommand unloads any profiles
                  configuring Xsan which were not installed by Profile Manager.
                  Profile removal will wipe the local Xsan configuration.

   Secondary commands
     These commands are less-frequently used commands for SAN management.

     changeIP oldIP newIP [oldHostName newHostName]
                  This subcommand must be run as root.  This subcommand changes
                  the SAN configuration locally and in LDAP if the current Xsan
                  address is oldIP.  newIP is used in its place. If the fully-
                  qualified domain name oldHostName is also passed as an
                  arguement, the host name retained in the LDAP configuration
                  for this host is changed to newHostName.  Please ensure that
                  all controllers have the SSL certificate for newHostName
                  before running this command. Changing the host name of a
                  controller will cause all clients in the SAN to re-read the
                  controller certificates.

     createMaster
                  Creates a new master LDAP server and a new directory node
                  administrator.

                  --cert-auth-name CertAuthName

                       Specify the name to be used for Certificate Authority.

                  --cert-admin-email CertAdminEmail

                       Specify the email address to be used for Certificate
                  Authority admin.

                  --user AdminFullName

                       Specify the full name for the new administrator account.

                  --account AdminAccountShortName

                       Specify the username for the new administrator account.

                  --pass AdminPassword

                       Specify the password for the new administrator account.


     createReplica
                  Creates a new replica from an existing LDAP master and joins
                  Open Directory.

                  --master MasterAddress

                       Specify the LDAP master IP address or name.

                  --account AdminAccountShortName

                       Specify the username for the administrator account.

                  --pass AdminPassword

                       Specify the password for the administrator account.


     destroyMaster
                  Turns off the LDAP server and deletes its database.

                  --account AdminAccountShortName

                       Specify the username for the administrator account.

                  --pass AdminPassword

                       Specify the password for the administrator account.


     destroyReplica
                  Unjoins Open Directory and removes a replica from an existing
                  LDAP master.

                  --account AdminAccountShortName

                       Specify the username for the administrator account.

                  --pass AdminPassword

                       Specify the password for the administrator account.


     activateSan [createReplica arguments]
                  This subcommand must be run as root and does not depend on
                  xsand running. This subcommand activates the previous Xsan SAN
                  configuration after macOS upgrade.  On secondary MDC, the
                  subcommand's behavior depends on the configuration state of
                  Open Directory when it runs.  Xsan controllers must be Open
                  Directory controllers for the cluster containing the SAN
                  configuration. If the computer is not an Open Directory
                  controller, this subcommand configures the computer to be a
                  replica in the Open Directory cluster, and then activates the
                  previous Xsan SAN configuraton.

                  The subcommand options supplied are examined in the case where
                  the computer is not an Open Directory controller. In this
                  case, they are processed as if the createReplica subcommand
                  had been run. In the case where the computer is already an
                  Open Directory controller, none of the additional
                  createReplica command options are valid.


     cullSan sanName
                  This subcommand must be run as root and does not depend on
                  xsand running.  This subcommand destroys the LDAP
                  configuration for a SAN.  This subcommand is intended to clean
                  up SAN configurations in LDAP which have been in the dead
                  state long enough that all clients have been unconfigured.
                  This operation can not be undone.

     disksChanged
                  Sends a notification to the Xsan file system that disks have
                  changed and should be rescanned.

     eraseVolume volumeName
                  Initializes the volume volumeName.

                  See CAUTION section below.

     renameVolume oldName newName
                  Renames an existing volume name to the new name. The existing
                  config file will be renamed, and the existing data directory
                  containing logs will be migrated to the new name. This
                  subcommand must be run as root.

     importVolume volumeConfigFile
                  Imports a volume into SAN using the specified volume config
                  file. Upon successful import, the volume will be started.

     dumpLdapConfig
                  Prints the SAN configuration.

                  --json

                       Print the configuration in JSON.

   Plumbing commands
     These commands expose specific points of SAN management functionality. They
     can be very powerful, and offer an administrator a lot of flexibility. Use
     these commands with care as they offer enough flexibility to trip and/or
     harm an administrator.

     sanConfigChanged
                  Sends a notification to the Xsan file system that the SAN
                  configuration has changed and should be reloaded.

     pushConfigUpdate
                  Pushes out a new configuration update. This subcommand must be
                  run as root and does not depend on xsand running. This
                  subcommand adjusts the SAN configuration in ldap to match the
                  configuration status in /Library/Preferences/Xsan.  If the
                  ldap configuration is changed, a configuration update message
                  will be posted to the SAN.

                  See CAUTION section below.

     ldapConfigChanged
                  This subcommand must be run as root and does not depend on
                  xsand running. This subcommand verifies the local
                  configuration with the configuration in ldap, and updates the
                  local configuration to match.

                  See CAUTION section below.

     roleChanged  Sends a notification to the Xsan file system that the role has
                  changed.

     wipeConfig   Causes the Xsan file system configuration to be reset to an
                  unconfigured state.

     listTask volumeName [options]
                  List the long running task for volumeName.  --cleanup Cleanup
                  the long running task if it has been completed.  --wait Wait
                  for the long running task to complete.

     listTasks    List all long running tasks for all volumes.

VOLUME DESCRIPTION
     The addVolume and editVolume verbs share the command options below. Most
     options are available to both verbs.  A few are only available to addVolume
     as they control settings which can not be modified by editVolume.


   VOLUME SETTINGS
     --caseSensitive
              Enable case sensitive on Xsan file system. When enabled, the
              volume considers filenames to be different if they are spelled
              alike but capitalized differently.


     --caseInsensitive
              Enable case insensitive on Xsan file system. When enabled, the
              volume considers filenames to be the same if they are spelled
              alike but capitalized differently. This setting is the default for
              new volumes.


     --enableACLs
              Specify whether the Xsan file system uses access control lists
              (ACLs) on a volume.


     --ignoreOwners
              Enable the noowners flag when mounting the volume, as documented
              in the mount(8) man page. This setting is the default for new
              volumes.


     --idsFromGUIDs
              Specify that Windows clients should dynamically generate UIDs and
              GIDs based on globally unique identifer (GUID) information in
              Active Directory domain when mapping user and group information to
              Xsan-compatible user IDs (UIDs) and group IDs (GIDs).


     --idsFromLDAP
              Specify that Windows clients should get UID and GID values from
              the uidNumber and gidNumber attributes in Active Directory records
              when mapping user and group information to Xsan-compatible user
              IDs (UIDs) and group IDs (GIDs).  This setting is the default for
              new volumes.


     --noExtendedAttrs
              Disable support for Apple Named Streams. Named Streams are
              utilized by Apple Xsan clients.  Disabling support on a Xsan file

   STORAGE POOL SETTINGS
     An Xsan volume contains one or more LUNs grouped into one or more Storage
     Pools.  A Storage Pool's description begins with a --storagePool argument
     which specifies the Storage Pool's name. Subsequent arguments control the
     content stored in the pool and add LUNs to the pool. A pool's description
     ends when a subsequent --storagePool argument starts the next pool, or the
     command line ends. Storage Pool names must be unique within the volume.

     As every volume requires one pool containing metadata and the journal, the
     --defaultFirstPool argument facilitates quickly creating such a Storage
     Pool. This argument is equivalent to this sequence of command arguments:
     --storagePool MetadataAndJournal --metadata --journal Further, this Storage
     Pool is placed at the beginning of the Storage Pool list, regardless of
     where this argument is located in the command line. For typical usage, the
     only arguments needed for this storage pool are to add one or more LUNs to
     the pool.

     If none of the content types are set on a Storage Pool, it defaults to
     contain userdata.

     --storagePool StoragePoolName
              Begin specifying a storage pool named StoragePoolName.  This
              argument implicitly ends any preceding Storage Pool description.

     --defaultFirstPool
              Begin specifying a storage pool named MetadataAndJournal which
              contains the journal and metadata. This Storage Pool is placed at
              the beginning of the Storage Pool list, regardless of where this
              argument is located on the command line.  This argument implicitly
              ends any preceding Storage Pool description.

     --metadata
              This Storage Pool may contain metadata.

     --journal
              This Storage Pool will contain the journal.

     --data   This Storage Pool may contain userdata.

     --any    Shorthand for specifying --metadata --data --journal

     --addLUN DiskLabelName
              Add a disk to the Storage Pool. The Disk Label name can be
              determined using using cvlabel command.

     --addLUNs Disk1LabelName,Disk2LabelName,...
              Add multiple disks to the Storage Pool.

     --stripeBreadth StripeBreadthSizeInKB
              Specify the amount of data that will be written to a LUN before
              switching to the next LUN within a stripe group. For optimal
              performance, stripeBreadth size should be a multiple of RAID
              stripe size. The stripeBreadth size must also be a multiple file
              system block size of 4096 bytes.

   COMMAND SETTINGS
     --dry-run
              Verify the requested operation without actually applying the
              changes.

     --output
              Write the volume configuration settings to the specified output
              path.  This option is intended exclusively for automated testing.
              This option is subject to change without notice.

     ---non-interactive
              Perform the requested operation without actually waiting for its
              completion.  The status of the operation can later be queried
              using the listTask or listTasks verbs. This option is intended
              exclusively for automated testing. This option is subject to
              change without notice.

   EXAMPLES
     addVolume superVolume --defaultFirstPool --addLUN metaLUN --storagePool
              lotsOfSpace --addLUNs firstAcreOfData,secondAcreOfData
              This command creates a new volume, superVolume with two Storage
              Pools, MetadataAndJournal and lotsOfSpace.  The first Storage Pool
              is the one named MetadataAndJournal and contains metadata and the
              journal. This storage pool contains one LUN named metaLUN.  The
              second Storage Pool is named lotsOfSpace and contains userdata due
              to the use of the default userdata specification. This Storage
              Pool contains two LUNs named firstAcreOfData and secondAcreOfData.

     addVolume superVolume --storagePool lotsOfSpace --addLUNs
              firstAcreOfData,secondAcreOfData --defaultFirstPool --addLUN
              metaLUN
              This command creates the same volume as before, and demonstrates
              how the Storage Pool created by --defaultFirstPool is always the
              first Storage Pool in the volume, regardless of where the argument
              is on the command line.

     editVolume superVolume --caseSensitive
              Change the volume superVolume to be case sensitive.

     editVolume superVolume --storagePool moreSpace --addLUNs
              thirdAcreOfData,fourthAcreOfData
              Add a new Storage Pool named moreSpace to the volume superVolume.
              This Storage Pool will contain two LUNs named thirdAcreOfData and
              fourthAcreOfData.

CAUTION
     The pushConfigUpdate and ldapConfigChanged verbs can permanently damage a
     SANs configuration when run on a controller if LDAP replication is not
     functioning correctly. These verbs assume that the local LDAP node contains
     a correct configuration for the SAN, and can lose data if this assumption
     is incorrect.

     The pushConfigUpdate verb especially can be dangerous if the local LDAP
     configuration is not current. Any local differences between it and the
     state in the /Library/Preferences/Xsan configuration files will trigger an
     update to the local LDAP which the SAN will then take as the most-up-to-
     date configuration.

     Specifically, if a volume has been created in the SAN but it is not
     described in the LDAP configuration of a controller executing
     pushConfigUpdate, this volume's configuration will be lost and any
     controller currently hosting it will stop. Clients will not correctly
     disconnect and thus require a hard reboot.

     The eraseVolume verb will destroy ALL existing data in the volume.
