TRIVIAL-REWRITE(8)           System Manager's Manual          TRIVIAL-REWRITE(8)




NAME
       trivial-rewrite - Postfix address rewriting and resolving daemon

SYNOPSIS
       trivial-rewrite [generic Postfix daemon options]

DESCRIPTION
       The trivial-rewrite(8) daemon processes three types of client service
       requests:

       rewrite context address
              Rewrite an address to standard form, according to the address
              rewriting context:

              local  Append the domain names specified with $myorigin or
                     $mydomain to incomplete addresses; do swap_bangpath and
                     allow_percent_hack processing as described below, and strip
                     source routed addresses (@site,@site:user@domain) to
                     user@domain form.

              remote Append the domain name specified with
                     $remote_header_rewrite_domain to incomplete addresses.
                     Otherwise the result is identical to that of the local
                     address rewriting context. This prevents Postfix from
                     appending the local domain to spam from poorly written
                     remote clients.

       resolve sender address
              Resolve the address to a (transport, nexthop, recipient, flags)
              quadruple. The meaning of the results is as follows:

              transport
                     The delivery agent to use. This is the first field of an
                     entry in the master.cf file.

              nexthop
                     The host to send to and optional delivery method
                     information.

              recipient
                     The envelope recipient address that is passed on to
                     nexthop.

              flags  The address class, whether the address requires relaying,
                     whether the address has problems, and whether the request
                     failed.

       verify sender address
              Resolve the address for address verification purposes.

SERVER PROCESS MANAGEMENT
       The trivial-rewrite(8) servers run under control by the Postfix master
       server.  Each server can handle multiple simultaneous connections.  When
       all servers are busy while a client connects, the master creates a new
       server process, provided that the trivial-rewrite server process limit is
       not exceeded.  Each trivial-rewrite server terminates after serving at
       least $max_use clients of after $max_idle seconds of idle time.

STANDARDS
       None. The command does not interact with the outside world.

SECURITY
       The trivial-rewrite(8) daemon is not security sensitive.  By default,
       this daemon does not talk to remote or local users.  It can run at a
       fixed low privilege in a chrooted environment.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Problems and transactions are logged to syslogd(8).

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
       On busy mail systems a long time may pass before a main.cf change
       affecting trivial-rewrite(8) is picked up. Use the command "postfix
       reload" to speed up a change.

       The text below provides only a parameter summary. See postconf(5) for
       more details including examples.

COMPATIBILITY CONTROLS

       resolve_dequoted_address (yes)
              Resolve a recipient address safely instead of correctly, by
              looking inside quotes.

       Available with Postfix version 2.1 and later:

       resolve_null_domain (no)
              Resolve an address that ends in the "@" null domain as if the
              local hostname were specified, instead of rejecting the address as
              invalid.

       Available with Postfix version 2.3 and later:

       resolve_numeric_domain (no)
              Resolve "user@ipaddress" as "user@[ipaddress]", instead of
              rejecting the address as invalid.

       Available with Postfix version 2.5 and later:

       allow_min_user (no)
              Allow a sender or recipient address to have `-' as the first
              character.

ADDRESS REWRITING CONTROLS

       myorigin ($myhostname)
              The domain name that locally-posted mail appears to come from, and
              that locally posted mail is delivered to.

       allow_percent_hack (yes)
              Enable the rewriting of the form "user%domain" to "user@domain".

       append_at_myorigin (yes)
              With locally submitted mail, append the string "@$myorigin" to
              mail addresses without domain information.

       append_dot_mydomain (Postfix >= 3.0: no, Postfix < 3.0: yes)
              With locally submitted mail, append the string ".$mydomain" to
              addresses that have no ".domain" information.

       recipient_delimiter (empty)
              The set of characters that can separate a user name from its
              extension (example: user+foo), or a .forward file name from its
              extension (example: .forward+foo).

       swap_bangpath (yes)
              Enable the rewriting of "site!user" into "user@site".

       Available in Postfix 2.2 and later:

       remote_header_rewrite_domain (empty)
              Don't rewrite message headers from remote clients at all when this
              parameter is empty; otherwise, rewrite message headers and append
              the specified domain name to incomplete addresses.

ROUTING CONTROLS
       The following is applicable to Postfix version 2.0 and later.  Earlier
       versions do not have support for: virtual_transport, relay_transport,
       virtual_alias_domains, virtual_mailbox_domains or proxy_interfaces.

       local_transport (local:$myhostname)
              The default mail delivery transport and next-hop destination for
              final delivery to domains listed with mydestination, and for
              [ipaddress] destinations that match $inet_interfaces or
              $proxy_interfaces.

       virtual_transport (virtual)
              The default mail delivery transport and next-hop destination for
              final delivery to domains listed with $virtual_mailbox_domains.

       relay_transport (relay)
              The default mail delivery transport and next-hop destination for
              remote delivery to domains listed with $relay_domains.

       default_transport (smtp)
              The default mail delivery transport and next-hop destination for
              destinations that do not match $mydestination, $inet_interfaces,
              $proxy_interfaces, $virtual_alias_domains,
              $virtual_mailbox_domains, or $relay_domains.

       parent_domain_matches_subdomains (see 'postconf -d' output)
              A list of Postfix features where the pattern "example.com" also
              matches subdomains of example.com, instead of requiring an
              explicit ".example.com" pattern.

       relayhost (empty)
              The next-hop destination of non-local mail; overrides non-local
              domains in recipient addresses.

       transport_maps (empty)
              Optional lookup tables with mappings from recipient address to
              (message delivery transport, next-hop destination).

       Available in Postfix version 2.3 and later:

       sender_dependent_relayhost_maps (empty)
              A sender-dependent override for the global relayhost parameter
              setting.

       Available in Postfix version 2.5 and later:

       empty_address_relayhost_maps_lookup_key (<>)
              The sender_dependent_relayhost_maps search string that will be
              used instead of the null sender address.

       Available in Postfix version 2.7 and later:

       empty_address_default_transport_maps_lookup_key (<>)
              The sender_dependent_default_transport_maps search string that
              will be used instead of the null sender address.

       sender_dependent_default_transport_maps (empty)
              A sender-dependent override for the global default_transport
              parameter setting.

ADDRESS VERIFICATION CONTROLS
       Postfix version 2.1 introduces sender and recipient address verification.
       This feature is implemented by sending probe email messages that are not
       actually delivered.  By default, address verification probes use the same
       route as regular mail. To override specific aspects of message routing
       for address verification probes, specify one or more of the following:

       address_verify_local_transport ($local_transport)
              Overrides the local_transport parameter setting for address
              verification probes.

       address_verify_virtual_transport ($virtual_transport)
              Overrides the virtual_transport parameter setting for address
              verification probes.

       address_verify_relay_transport ($relay_transport)
              Overrides the relay_transport parameter setting for address
              verification probes.

       address_verify_default_transport ($default_transport)
              Overrides the default_transport parameter setting for address
              verification probes.

       address_verify_relayhost ($relayhost)
              Overrides the relayhost parameter setting for address verification
              probes.

       address_verify_transport_maps ($transport_maps)
              Overrides the transport_maps parameter setting for address
              verification probes.

       Available in Postfix version 2.3 and later:

       address_verify_sender_dependent_relayhost_maps
       ($sender_dependent_relayhost_maps)
              Overrides the sender_dependent_relayhost_maps parameter setting
              for address verification probes.

       Available in Postfix version 2.7 and later:

       address_verify_sender_dependent_default_transport_maps
       ($sender_dependent_default_transport_maps)
              Overrides the sender_dependent_default_transport_maps parameter
              setting for address verification probes.
