NAME
       snstatd - Xsan Statistics Daemon

SYNOPSIS
       Xsan File System process

DESCRIPTION
       snstatd is a daemon that is launched by the Xsan File System fsmpm(8)
       process. It is used to gather statistics about file system activity and
       related activity such as I/O and storage manager activity.  This daemon
       also services requests from the qustat command and archives statistics to
       .csv files.  The archive files reside in /usr/cvfs/qustats.

       snstatd is configured using the qustat.conf(5) configuration file, which
       specifies the intervals for gathering and archiving statistics.
       Debugging levels can also be specified in this file.

       snstatd may be started, stopped or restarted in cvadmin(8) using the
       startd, stopd, restartd commands respectively. This may be done to
       propagate changes made to the existing qustat.conf(5) file.

       snstatd logs to /Library/Logs/Xsan/debug/snstatd.log for debugging
       purposes.

ENVIRONMENT
       snstatd is available on all Xsan installs.
