TALKD(8)                     System Manager's Manual                    TALKD(8)

NAME
     talkd â€“ remote user communication server

SYNOPSIS
     talkd

DESCRIPTION
     The talkd utility is the server that notifies a user that someone else
     wants to initiate a conversation.  It acts as a repository of invitations,
     responding to requests by clients wishing to rendezvous to hold a
     conversation.  In normal operation, a client, the caller, initiates a
     rendezvous by sending a CTL_MSG to the server of type LOOK_UP (see
     <protocols/talkd.h>).  This causes the server to search its invitation
     tables to check if an invitation currently exists for the caller (to speak
     to the callee specified in the message).

     If the lookup fails, the caller then sends an ANNOUNCE message causing the
     server to broadcast an announcement on the callee's login ports requesting
     contact.

     When the callee responds, the local server uses the recorded invitation to
     respond with the appropriate rendezvous address and the caller and callee
     client programs establish a stream connection through which the
     conversation takes place.

CONFIGURATION
     The talkd utility is managed by launchd(8) as specified in the ntalk.plist
     property list.  By default the property list contains the Disabled key set
     to true, so talkd is never invoked.

     Execute the following command as root to enable talkd:
           launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ntalk.plist

SEE ALSO
     talk(1), write(1)

HISTORY
     The talkd utility appeared in 4.3BSD.
