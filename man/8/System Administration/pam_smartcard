NAME
     pam_smartcard – Smartcard PAM module

SYNOPSIS
     [service-name] function-class control-flag pam_smartcard [options]

DESCRIPTION
     The Smartcard PAM module supports authentication function class.  In terms
     of the function-class parameter, this is “auth.”

   The Smartcard Authentication Module
     This module permits or denies users based on smartcard authentication
     support in the Open Directory database, and the presence of an appropriate
     smartcard in the reader attached to the local machine. When a card is
     locked, the user is asked to unlock it with his PIN.

   The following options may be passed to this account management module:
     no_check_shell
             Continues evaluation even if user's shell is not valid. Normally,
             users with a shell like /usr/bin/false are considered as disabled.

     no_ignore
             Return failure when an appropriate smartcard is not present.

EXAMPLE

     Adding the following line on the top of the /etc/pam.d/sudo enables smartcard support for sudo:
             auth   sufficient     pam_smartcard.so
