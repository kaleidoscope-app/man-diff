taskgated(8)                 System Manager's Manual                taskgated(8)

NAME
     taskgated â€“ task_for_pid access control daemon taskgated is a system daemon
     that implements a policy for the task_for_pid system service.  When the
     kernel is asked for the task port of a process, and preliminary access
     control checks pass, it invokes this daemon (via launchd) to make the
     decision.
