NAME
     fsck_hfs â€“ HFS file system consistency check

SYNOPSIS
     fsck_hfs -q [-df] special ...
     fsck_hfs -p [-df] special ...
     fsck_hfs [-n | -y | -r] [-dfgxlES] [-D flags] [-b size] [-B path] [-m mode]
              [-c size] [-R flags] special ...

DESCRIPTION
     The fsck_hfs utility verifies and repairs HFS+ file systems.

     The first form of fsck_hfs quickly checks the specified file systems to
     determine whether they were cleanly unmounted.

     The second form of fsck_hfs preens the specified file systems.  It is
     normally started by fsck(8) run from /etc/rc.boot during automatic reboot,
     when a HFS file system is detected.  When preening file systems, fsck_hfs
     will fix common inconsistencies for file systems that were not unmounted
     cleanly.  If more serious problems are found, fsck_hfs does not try to fix
     them, indicates that it was not successful, and exits.

     The third form of fsck_hfs checks the specified file systems and tries to
     repair all detected inconsistencies.

     If no options are specified fsck_hfs will always check and attempt to fix
     the specified file systems.

     The options are as follows:

           -c size Specify the size of the cache used by fsck_hfs internally.
                   Bigger size can result in better performance but can result
                   in deadlock when used with -l option.  Size can be specified
                   as a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal number.  If the number
                   ends with a ``k'', ``m'', or ``g'', the number is multiplied
                   by 1024 (1K), 1048576 (1M), or 1073741824 (1G), respectively.

           -d      Display debugging information.  This option may provide
                   useful information when fsck_hfs cannot repair a damaged file
                   system.

           -D flags Print extra debugging information.  The flags are a bitmap
                   that control which kind of debug information is printed.  The
                   following values are currently implemented:
                         0x0001  Informational messages
                         0x0002  Error messages
                         0x0010  Extended attributes related messages
                         0x0020  Overlapped extents related messages

           -b size Specify the size, in bytes, of the physical blocks used by
                   the -B option.

           -B path Print the files containing the physical blocks listed in the
                   file path.  The file should contain one or more decimal,
                   octal (with leading 0) or hexadecimal (with leading 0x)
                   numbers separated by white space.  The physical block numbers
                   are relative to the start of the partition, so if you have
                   block numbers relative to the start of the device, you will
                   have to subtract the block number of the start of the
                   partition.  The size of a physical block is given with the -b
                   option; the default is 512 bytes per block.

           -f      When used with the -p option, force fsck_hfs to check `clean'
                   file systems, otherwise it means force fsck_hfs to check and
                   repair journaled HFS+ file systems.

           -g      Causes fsck_hfs to generate its output strings in GUI format.
                   This option is used when another application with a graphical
                   user interface (like Mac OS X Disk Utility) is invoking the
                   fsck_hfs tool.

           -x      Causes fsck_hfs to generate its output strings in XML (plist)
                   format.  This option implies the -g option.

           -l      Lock down the file system and perform a test-only check.
                   This makes it possible to check a file system that is
                   currently mounted, although no repairs can be made.

           -m mode Mode is an octal number that will be used to set the
                   permissions for the lost+found directory when it is created.
                   The lost+found directory is only created when a volume is
                   repaired and orphaned files or directories are detected.
                   fsck_hfs places orphaned files and directories into the
                   lost+found directory (located at the root of the volume).
                   The default mode is 01777.

           -p      Preen the specified file systems.

           -q      Causes fsck_hfs to quickly check whether the volume was
                   unmounted cleanly.  If the volume was unmounted cleanly, then
                   the exit status is 0.  If the volume was not unmounted
                   cleanly, then the exit status will be non-zero.  In either
                   case, a message is printed to standard output describing
                   whether the volume was clean or dirty.

           -y      Always attempt to repair any damage that is found.

           -n      Never attempt to repair any damage that is found.

           -E      Cause fsck_hfs to exit (with a value of 47) if it encounters
                   any major errors.  A ``major error'' is considered one which
                   would impact using the volume in normal usage; an
                   inconsistency which would not impact such use is considered
                   ``minor'' for this option.  Only valid with the -n option.

           -S      Cause fsck_hfs to scan the entire device looking for I/O
                   errors.  It will attempt to map the blocks with errors to
                   names, similar to the -B option.

           -R flags Rebuilds the requested btree.  The following flags are
                   supported:
                         a       Attribute btree
                         c       Catalog btree
                         e       Extents overflow btree
                   Rebuilding a btree will only work if there is enough free
                   space on the file system for the new btree file, and if
                   fsck_hfs is able to traverse each of the nodes in the
                   requested btree successfully.

           -r      Rebuild the catalog btree.  This is synonymous with -Rc.

     Because of inconsistencies between the block device and the buffer cache,
     the raw device should always be used.

EXIT VALUES
     fsck_hfs indicates some status by exit value.  The current list of exit
     status results is:
           0       No errors found, or successfully repaired.
           3       A quick-check (the -n option) found a dirty filesystem; no
                   repairs were made.  There is a potential corruption in the
                   filesystem, and either the journal could not be read, or a
                   runtime corruption was present so the HFS Volume Inconsistent
                   bit was set.
           4       During boot, the root filesystem was found to be dirty;
                   repairs were made, and the filesystem was remounted.  The
                   system should be rebooted.
           8       A corrupt filesystem was found during a check, or repairs did
                   not succeed.
           47      A major error was found with -E.
