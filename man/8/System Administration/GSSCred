GSSCred(8)                   System Manager's Manual                  GSSCred(8)

NAME
     GSSCred â€“ manages GSS-API credentials

DESCRIPTION
     GSSCred manages the lifecycle of GSS-API credentials.

Other options on Mac OS X
     use-uid-matching
          The default behavior of GSSCred on macOS is to use the audit session
          id to allow access to credentials.  This enables credentials to be
          shared with sudo sessions.  To enable the same uid to access them from
          other audit sessions, run this defaults command:

                sudo defaults write
                /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Heimdal.GSSCred use-uid-matching
                -bool true

     renew-interval
          The default interval in seconds to renew credentials is 2 hours. To
          change it set the default:

                sudo defaults write
                /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Heimdal.GSSCred renew-interval
                -int 7200
