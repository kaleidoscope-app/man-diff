NAME
     tmdiagnose – gather information to aid in diagnosing Time Machine issues

SYNOPSIS
     tmdiagnose -h
     tmdiagnose [-d seconds] [-f path] [-m] [-r]

DESCRIPTION
     The tmdiagnose tool gathers system and backup information in order to
     assist Apple when investigating issues related to Time Machine. A great
     deal of information is harvested, spanning system state, system and backup
     configuration, and snapshot details.

   What tmdiagnose Collects:
           •   A spindump of the system
           •   Several seconds of fs_usage ouput
           •   Several seconds of top output
           •   Individual samples of backupd and Finder
           •   Power Management state and logs
           •   IOKit registry information
           •   A netstat inspection
           •   A list of all open files on the system
           •   All system logs
           •   All kernel logs
           •   All install logs
           •   All fsck_hfs logs
           •   All WiFi logs
           •   Disk Utility logs for all local users
           •   The system migration log
           •   All spin and crash reports for the following processes:
                  backupd
                  mds
                  diskimages-helper
                  DesktopServicesHelper
                  newfs_hfs
                  NetAuthSysAgent

           •   Recent spin and crash reports for the following processes, for
               all local users:
                  Finder
                  Locum
                  System Settings
                  SystemUIServer
                  iPhoto
                  Mail
                  MailTimeMachineHelper
                  Address Book

           •   Basic information about reachable AirPort and Time Capsule
               devices
           •   The FindSystemFiles cache
           •   Information about disks and mounted network shares
           •   Information about attached disk images
           •   A System Profiler report
           •   A list of software that has been installed via the darwinup tool
           •   Time Machine preferences, caches, and configuration information
           •   Comprehensive information about Time Machine backups and
               snapshots

     The high-level backup structure for the current machine directory is
     recreated inside the diagnostic bundle, including the capture of various
     Time Machine log files contained within snapshots. Items in this "skeleton"
     structure have on them the extended attributes of the originals.
     Recreations of local snapshots are also captured in the same manner.

     The tmdiagnose tool will run the Spotlight diagnostic tool mddiagnose
     automatically, if it is available.

   What tmdiagnose Doesn't Collect:
           •   No user files are harvested from within backups
           •   No authentication credentials are harvested from the system
           •   No authentication credentials are harvested for reachable AirPort
               and Time Capsule devices

OPTIONS
     -h      Print full usage.
     -d sec  Delay the start of the diagnostic by sec seconds. The system alert
             sound will play two times when the diagnostic begins.
     -f path Write the diagnostic to the specified path.
     -m      Gather memory diagnostics for backupd and Finder.
     -r      Do not reveal the diagnostic in Finder when finished.

EXIT STATUS
     tmdiagnose exits with status 0 if there were no internal errors encountered
     during the diagnostic, or >0 when an error unrelated to external state
     occurs or unusable input is provided by the user.
