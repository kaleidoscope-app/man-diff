DESCRIPTION
     bless is used to modify the volume bootability characteristics of
     filesystems, as well as select the active boot device.  bless has 6 modes
     of execution: Folder Mode, Mount Mode, Device Mode, NetBoot Mode, Info
     Mode, and Unbless Mode.

     Folder Mode allows you to select a directory on a mounted volume to act as
     the “blessed” directory, which causes the system firmware to look in that
     directory for boot code. EFI-based systems also support a “blessed” system
     file, which is the primary mechanism of specifying the booter for a volume
     for those systems. In Folder Mode, if you are operating on an HFS+ volume,
     the HFS+ Volume Header is updated to reflect the files/directories given,
     which persists even if the volume is moved to another system or NVRAM is
     cleared.

     Mount Mode does not make permanent modifications to the filesystem, but
     rather set the system firmware to boot from the specified volume, assuming
     it has been properly blessed. This is a subset of the functionality of
     Folder Mode with the --setBoot option, but is convenient when you don't
     want to change or interrogate the filesystem for its blessed status.

     Device Mode is similar to Mount Mode, but allows selection of unmounted
     filesystems, for instance while in single user mode. It can also perform
     certain offline modifications to the filesystem, but is not generally
     recommended.

     NetBoot Mode sets the system firmware to boot from the network, using a URL
     syntax to specify the protocol and server.  bless only sets the local
     system to go into NetBoot mode, and does not communicate to the server what
     image should be used, if there are multiple images. Some other mechanism,
     such as using Startup Disk, should be used to select that.

     Info Mode will print out the currently-blessed directory of a volume, or if
     no mountpoint is specified, the active boot device that the firmware is set
     to boot from.

     Unbless Mode complements Folder Mode, and clears the persistent blessed
     folder and file information on HFS+ volumes.

     Additionally, --help can be used to display the command-line usage summary.

OPTIONS FOR INTEL ARCHITECTURE BASED DEVICES or EXTERNAL STORAGE DEVICES:
   FILE/FOLDER MODE
     Folder Mode has the following options:
     --folder directory       Set this directory to be the Mac OS X/Darwin
                              blessed directory, containing a BootX secondary
                              loader for New World machines.
     --file file              Set this file to be the Mac OS X/Darwin blessed
                              boot file, containing a booter for EFI-based
                              systems. If this option is not provided, a default
                              boot file is used based on the blessed directory.
     --bootinfo [file]        Create a BootX file in the Mac OS X/Darwin system
                              folder using file as a source. If file is not
                              provided, a default is used (see FILES), using a
                              path relative to the mountpoint you are blessing.
                              This attempts to ensure that a BootX is used that
                              is compatible with the OS on the target volume.
     --bootefi [file]         Create a boot.efi file in the Mac OS X/Darwin
                              system folder using file as a source. If file is
                              not provided, a default is used (see FILES), using
                              a path relative to the mountpoint you are
                              blessing. This attempts to ensure that a boot.efi
                              is used that is compatible with the OS on the
                              target volume. If --file is also provided, the new
                              file will be created at that path instead.
     --label name             Render a text label used in the firmware-based OS
                              picker
     --labelfile file         Use a pre-rendered label used for the firmware-
                              based OS picker
     --openfolder directory   Specify a folder to be opened in the Finder when
                              the volume is mounted by the system.
     --setBoot                Set the system to boot off the specified
                              partition. This is implemented in a platform-
                              specific manner. On Open Firmware-based systems,
                              the boot-device variable is modified. On EFI-based
                              systems, the efi-boot-device variable is changed.
                              This is not supported on Apple Silicon based
                              systems.
     --nextonly               Only change the boot device selection for the next
                              boot. This is only supported on EFI-based systems.
     --shortform              Use an abbreviated device path form. This option
                              can allow for booting from new devices, at the
                              expense of boot time performance. This is only
                              supported on EFI-based systems.
     --legacy                 If --setBoot is given, set the firmware to boot a
                              legacy BIOS-based operating system from the
                              specified disk. The active flag of an MBR-
                              partitioned disk is not modified, which can be
                              done with fdisk(8) . This is only supported on
                              EFI-based systems.
     --legacydrivehint device
                              Instruct the firmware to treat the specified whole
                              disk as the primary, master IDE drive. This is
                              only supported on EFI-based systems.
     --options                Set load options associated with the new boot
                              option. This is only supported on EFI-based
                              systems, and in general should be avoided.
                              Instead, use nvram(8) to set "boot-args" , which
                              will work with both Open Firmware- and EFI-based
                              systems.
     --personalize            Attempts to do a personalization operation on the
                              target, which validates the SecureBoot bundle and
                              ensures that the relevant boot files are signed
                              and valid for this particular machine.  This may
                              require network access, in order to check the
                              signatures.
     --create-snapshot        Attempts to create an APFS root snapshot of the
                              target APFS system volume and set it as root
                              snapshot of the system volume. The target system
                              will boot from this snapshot on its next boot.
     --last-sealed-snapshot   Reverts back to using the previously signed APFS
                              root snapshot reenabling Authenticated Root
                              Volume.
                               The target system will boot from this sealed
                              snapshot on its next boot.
     --quiet                  Do not print any output
     --verbose                Print verbose output

   MOUNT MODE
     Mount Mode has the following options:
     --mount directory        Use the volume mounted at directory to change the
                              active boot device, in conjunction with --setBoot.
                              The volume must already be properly blessed.
     --file file              Instead of allowing the firmware to discover the
                              booter based on the blessed directory or file,
                              pass an explicit path to the firmware to boot
                              from. This can be used to run EFI applications or
                              EFI booters for alternate OSes, but should not be
                              normally used. This is only supported on EFI-based
                              systems.
     --setBoot                Same as for Folder Mode.
     --nextonly               Same as for Folder Mode.
     --shortform              Same as for Folder Mode.
     --legacy                 Same as for Folder Mode.
     --legacydrivehint device
                              Same as for Folder Mode.
     --options                Same as for Folder Mode.
     --personalize            Same as for Folder Mode.
     --create-snapshot        Same as for Folder Mode.
     --last-sealed-snapshot   Same as for Folder Mode.
     --bootefi                This enables copying required boot objects when
                              --create-snapshot or --last-sealed-snapshot is
                              given.
     --quiet                  Do not print any output
     --verbose                Print verbose output

   DEVICE MODE
     Device Mode has the following options:
     --device device          Use the block device device to change the active
                              boot device. No volumes should be mounted from
                              device , and the filesystem should already be
                              properly blessed.
     --label name             Set the firmware-based OS picker label for the
                              unmounted filesystem, using name , which should be
                              in UTF-8 encoding.
     --labelfile file         Use a pre-rendered label used with the firmware-
                              based OS picker.
     --setBoot                Set the system to boot off the specified
                              partition, as with Folder and Mount Modes.
     --startupfile file       Add the file as the HFS+ StartupFile, and update
                              other information on disk as appropriate for the
                              startup file type.
     --nextonly               Same as for Folder Mode.
     --shortform              Same as for Folder Mode.
     --options                Same as for Folder Mode.
     --legacy                 Same as for Folder Mode.
     --legacydrivehint device
                              Same as for Folder Mode.
     --quiet                  Do not print any output
     --verbose                Print verbose output

   NETBOOT MODE
     NetBoot Mode has the following options:
     --netboot                Instead of setting the active boot selection to a
                              disk-based volume, set the system to NetBoot.
     --server protocol://[interface@]server
                              A URL specification of how to boot the system.
                              Currently, the only protocol supported is BSDP
                              ("bsdp"), Apple's Boot Service Discovery Protocol.
                              The interface is optional, and the server is the
                              IPv4 address of the server in dotted-quad
                              notation. If there is not a specific server you'd
                              like to use, pass "255.255.255.255" to have the
                              firmware broadcast for the first available server.
                              Examples of this notation would be
                              "bsdp://255.255.255.255" and
                              "bsdp://en1@17.203.12.203".
     --nextonly               Same as for Folder Mode.
     --options                Same as for Folder Mode.
     --quiet                  Do not print any output
     --verbose                Print verbose output

   INFO MODE
     Info Mode has the following options:
     --info [directory]       Print out the blessed system folder for the volume
                              mounted at directory . If directory is not
                              specified, print information for the currently
                              selected boot device (which may not necessarily be
                              ‘/’ ). This is not supported on Apple Silicon
                              based systems.
     --getBoot                Print out the logical boot device, based on what
                              is currently selected. This option will take into
                              account the fact that the firmware may be pointing
                              to an auxiliary booter partition, and will print
                              out the corresponding root partition for those
                              cases. If the system is configured to NetBoot, a
                              URL matching the format of the --server
                              specification for NetBoot mode will be printed.
     --plist                  Output all information in Property List (.plist)
                              format, suitable for parsing by CoreFoundation.
                              This is most useful when bless is executed from
                              another program and its standard output must be
                              parsed.
     --quiet                  Do not print any output
     --verbose                Print verbose output
     --version                Print bless version and exit immediately

   UNBLESS MODE
     Unbless Mode has the following options:
     --unbless directory      Use the HFS+ volume mounted at directory and unset
                              any persistent blessed files/directories in the
                              HFS+ Volume Header.

OPTIONS FOR APPLE SILICON DEVICES:
     NOTE: Admin credentials may be prompted when running bless on an Apple
     silicon platform (beyond running the tool as an admin user). However, if
     the volume has been previously blessed by a different OS instance, then
     these credentials may not be necessary or used to bless the target OS.

   MOUNT MODE
     Mount Mode has the following options:
     --mount directory        Use the volume mounted at directory to change the
                              active boot device, in conjunction with
     --setBoot.               The volume must already be properly blessed.
     --nextonly               Only change the boot device selection for the next
                              boot.
     --create-snapshot        Attempts to create an APFS root snapshot of the
                              target APFS system volume and set it as root
                              snapshot of the system volume. The target system
                              will boot from this snapshot on its next boot.
     --last-sealed-snapshot   Reverts back to using the previously signed APFS
                              root snapshot reenabling Authenticated Root
                              Volume.  The target system will boot from this
                              sealed snapshot on its next boot.
     --user                   Collect a local owner username to authorize boot
                              policy modification.
     --stdinpass              Collect a local owner password from stdin without
                              prompting.
     --passpromt              Explicitly ask to be prompted for the password.
     --quiet                  Do not print any output
     --verbose                Print verbose output

   DEVICE MODE
     Device Mode has the following options:
     --device device          Use the block device device to change the active
                              boot device. No volumes should be mounted from
                              device , and the filesystem should already be
                              properly blessed.
     --setBoot                Set the system to boot off the specified volume,
                              as with Mount and Device mode Modes.  for the
                              startup file type.
     --nextonly               Same as for Mount Mode.
     --user                   Collect a local owner username to authorize boot
                              policy modification.
     --stdinpass              Collect a local owner password from stdin without
                              prompting.
     --passpromt              Explicitly ask to be prompted for the password.
     --quiet                  Do not print any output
     --verbose                Print verbose output

   INFO MODE
     Info Mode has the following options:
     --getBoot                Print out the logical boot device, based on what
                              is currently selected. This option will take into
                              account the fact that the firmware may be pointing
                              to an auxiliary booter partition, and will print
                              out the corresponding root partition for those
                              cases.
     --plist                  Output all information in Property List (.plist)
                              format, suitable for parsing by CoreFoundation.
                              This is most useful when bless is executed from
                              another program and its standard output must be
                              parsed.
     --user                   Collect a local owner username to authorize boot
                              policy modification.
     --stdinpass              Collect a local owner password from stdin without
                              prompting.
     --passpromt              Explicitly ask to be prompted for the password.
     --quiet                  Do not print any output
     --verbose                Print verbose output
     --version                Print bless version and exit immediately

FILES
     /usr/standalone/ppc/bootx.bootinfo  Secondary loader with XML headers, used
                                         with the --bootinfo flag. Used for
                                         booting New World PPC-based
                                         Macintoshes. If the argument to
                                         --bootinfo is ommitted, this file will
                                         be used as the default input.
     /usr/standalone/i386/boot.efi       Booter for EFI-based systems, used with
                                         the --bootefi flag. If the argument to
                                         --bootefi is ommitted, this file will
                                         be used as the default input.
     /System/Library/CoreServices        Typical blessed folder for Mac OS X and
                                         Darwin

EXAMPLES
   FOLDER MODE
     To bless a volume with only Mac OS X or Darwin, and create the BootX and
     boot.efi files as needed:

           bless --folder "/Volumes/Mac OS X/System/Library/CoreServices"
           --bootinfo --bootefi

   MOUNT MODE
     To set a volume containing either Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X to be the active
     volume:

           bless --mount "/Volumes/Mac OS" --setBoot

   NETBOOT MODE
     To set the system to NetBoot and broadcast for an available server:

           bless --netboot --server bsdp://255.255.255.255

   INFO MODE
     To gather information about the currently selected volume (as determined by
     the firmware), suitable for piping to a program capable of parsing Property
     Lists:

           bless --info --plist
