NAME
       lpc - line printer control program (deprecated)

SYNOPSIS
       lpc [ command [ parameter(s) ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       lpc provides limited control over printer and class queues provided by
       CUPS. It can also be used to query the state of queues.

       If no command is specified on the command-line, lpc displays a prompt and
       accepts commands from the standard input.

   COMMANDS
       The lpc program accepts a subset of commands accepted by the Berkeley lpc
       program of the same name:

       exit Exits the command interpreter.

       help [command]

       ? [command]
            Displays a short help message.

       quit Exits the command interpreter.

       status [queue]
            Displays the status of one or more printer or class queues.

NOTES
       This program is deprecated and will be removed in a future feature
       release of CUPS.

       Since lpc is geared towards the Berkeley printing system, it is
       impossible to use lpc to configure printer or class queues provided by
       CUPS.  To configure printer or class queues you must use the lpadmin(8)
       command or another CUPS-compatible client with that functionality.
