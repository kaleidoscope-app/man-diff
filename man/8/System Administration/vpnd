vpnd(8)                      System Manager's Manual                     vpnd(8)



NAME
     vpnd â€“ Mac OS X VPN service daemon

SYNOPSIS
     vpnd [-d | -n | -x] [-i server_id]
     vpnd [-h]



DESCRIPTION
     vpnd allows external hosts to tunnel via L2TP over IPSec or via PPTP from
     an insecure external network (such as the Internet) into a "secure"
     internal network, such as a corporate network.  All traffic through the
     tunnel is encrypted to provide secure communications, with L2TP/IPSec
     providing a higher level of security than PPTP.

     vpnd listens for incoming connections, pairs each one with an available
     internal IP address, and passes the connection to pppd(8) with appropriate
     parameters.  Parameters for vpnd are specified in a system configuration
     (plist) file in XML format.  This file contains a dictionary of
     configurations each identified by a key referred to as a server_id.
     Parameters include the tunneling protocol, IP addresses to be assigned to
     clients, PPP parameters etc.

     vpnd is launched for a particular configuration by using the -i option
     which takes the server_id to be run as an argument.  vpnd can also be run
     without the -i option.  In this case it will check the configuration file
     for a special array which contains a list of configurations to be run and
     will fork and exec a copy of vpnd for each server_id to be run.  Running
     multiple vpnd processes simultaneously for a particular protocol is not
     allowed.

     vpnd will be launched during the boot process by a startup item if the
     field VPNSERVER is defined in /etc/hostconfig with the value -YES-.
     Typically, in this case it will be launched without the -i option and will
     check the configuration file to determine which configuration(s) are to be
     run.

     vpnd logs items of interest to the system log.  A different log path can be
     specified in the configuration file.


OPTIONS
     The following options are available:

     -d    Do not move to background and print log strings to the terminal.

     -h    Print usage summary and exit.

     -i    Server_id in the plist file that defines the configuration to be run.

     -n    Do not move to background, print log information to the terminal, and
           quit after validating the argument list.

     -x    Do not move to background.


EXAMPLES
     The default invocation,

           vpnd

     will read the list of configurations to run from the configuration file and
     launch them.  This default configuration may be enabled at startup by
     defining VPNSERVER to -YES-.

     To specify a particular configuration to run use

           vpnd -i server_id
