NAME
     recentsd â€“ recentsd daemon

DESCRIPTION
     recentsd is used by Mail, Messages, and other apps on the system. It keeps
     track of recently used email addresses, phone numbers, and locations so you
     can use them again without adding them to your address book.

     This command is not intended to be invoked directly.
