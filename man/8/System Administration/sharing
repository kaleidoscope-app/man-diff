SYNOPSIS
     sharing [-a <path> [options]] [-e <share point name> [options]]
             [-r <share point name>] [-l]

DESCRIPTION
     A list of flags and their descriptions:

     -a <path>
              Add a new share point for the directory specified by <path>.

     -e <share point name>
              Edit the share point record specified by <share point name>.

     -r <share point name>
              Delete the share point record specified by <share point name>.

     -l       List all existing share point records.

     The following options modify share point record attributes:

     -S <smb name>
              Use customized name <smb name> when using share points with smb.

     -s <flags>
              Use this option to enable and disable sharing via smb.  By default
              a share point is enabled for smb protocol.  To enable and disable
              services, use the following flags as required: 001 (enable sharing
              for smb).  Specify 000 to turn off sharing of a share point
              altogether.

     -g <guest flag>
              Use this option to enable and disable guest access for smb.  By
              default guest access is enabled for smb.  To enable and disable
              guest access services, use the following flags as required: 001
              (enable guest for smb).  Specify 000 to turn off guest access for
              a share point altogether.

     -n <customized record name>
              Specify a <customized record name> to be used as the share point
              record name.  By default the record name is the name of the
              directory pointed to by the share point record.  This directory is
              specified by the <path> when the record is created.

     -R <0/1>
              Make share read only for smb. Specify 1 to enable read only.
              Specify 0 to disable read only.

     -E <0/1>
              Make share encrypted for smb v3 and later. Specify 1 to enable
              encryption. Specify 0 to disable encryption.

     -f <format>
              Only used when listing share points and only json format is
              supported.
