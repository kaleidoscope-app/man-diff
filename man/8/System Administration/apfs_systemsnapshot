APFS_SYSTEMSNAPSHOT(8)       System Manager's Manual      APFS_SYSTEMSNAPSHOT(8)

NAME
     apfs_systemsnapshot â€“ create and tag APFS system snapshots

SYNOPSIS
     apfs_systemsnapshot -r snapshot_name -v mount_point
     apfs_systemsnapshot -s snapshot_name -v mount_point
     apfs_systemsnapshot -h

DESCRIPTION
     The apfs_systemsnapshot utility can create or tag a new snapshot of a
     Signed System Volume.

     apfs_systemsnapshot requires disabling the authenticated-root System
     Integrity Protection configuration from recoveryOS.  Once disabled, non-
     sealed snapshots can be created and tagged as the snapshot to be rooted
     from.

     apfs_systemsnapshot should not be used when working on kernel extension
     development, bless(8) should be used instead.

     The mount_point parameter should be the mount point of a Signed System
     Volume.

     The options are as follows:

     -r snapshot_name      Tag snapshot_name as the root snapshot to boot from
                           upon next boot.

     -s snapshot_name      Create a new system snapshot named snapshot_name.

     -h                    Print a usage message.

EXIT STATUS
     apfs_systemsnapshot exits with 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
