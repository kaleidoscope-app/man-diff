DESCRIPTION
     The dirhelper command is a launch-on-demand helper for special directory
     creation.  It is launched in a privileged context via launchd in order to
     create special directories where the user would not otherwise have
     permission to do so.

     The dirhelper command should not be invoked directly.  It will exit
     automatically after a period of inactivity.
