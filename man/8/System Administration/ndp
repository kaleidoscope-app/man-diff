     ndp -d [-nt] hostname
     ndp -f [-nt] filename

     ndp -r
     ndp -R
     ndp -s [-nt] nodename ether_addr [temp] [proxy]

DESCRIPTION
     The ndp command manipulates the address mapping table used by Neighbor
     Discovery Protocol (NDP).

     -a      Dump the currently existing NDP entries.

     -A wait
             Repeat -a (dump NDP entries) every wait seconds.

     -c      Erase all the NDP entries.

     -d      Delete specified NDP entry.

     -f      Parse the file specified by filename.

     -H      Harmonize consistency between the routing table and the default
             router list; install the top entry of the list into the kernel
             routing table.

     -I [delete | interface]
             Shows or specifies the default interface used as the default route
             when there is no default router.  If no argument is given to the
             option, the current default interface will be shown.  If an
             interface is specified, the interface will be used as the default.
             If a special keyword delete is specified, the current default
             interface will be deleted from the kernel.

     -i interface [flags...]
             View ND information for the specified interface.  If additional
             arguments flags are given, ndp sets or clears the specified flags
             for the interface.  Possible flags are as follows.  All of the
             flags can begin with the special character ‘-’, which means the
             flag should be cleared.
             nud     turn on or off NUD (Neighbor Unreachability Detection) on
                     the interface.  NUD is usually turned on by default.
             disabled
                     IPv6 can be disabled separately from other network
                     protocols. This flag can be turned on automatically when
                     Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) indicates that another
                     device on the network is using the same link-local address.
             proxy_prefixes
                     the interface is enabled to proxy neighbor discovery for
                     global scope prefixes matching those on link at other
                     interfaces.
             insecure do not use cryptographically generated addresses (CGA) on
                     this interface.
             replicated Address autoconfiguration proceeds under the assumption
                     that interface configuration is replicated by a sleep proxy
                     at another node on the link.  Disables optimistic DAD and
                     sends unsolicited NA with O=1 when DAD completes.  Ignores
                     DAD failures from other hardware addresses.

     -l      Show link-layer reachability information.

     -n      Do not try to resolve numeric address to hostname.

     -p      Show prefix list.

     -P      Flush all the entries in the prefix list.

     -r      Show default router list.

     -R      Flush all the entries in the default router list.

     -s      Register an NDP entry for a node.  The entry will be permanent
             unless the word temp is given in the command.  If the word proxy is
             given, this system will act as an proxy NDP server, responding to
             requests for hostname even though the host address is not its own.

     -t      Print timestamp on each entries, to make it possible to merge
             output with tcpdump(1).  Most useful when used with -A.

     -x      Show extended link-layer reachability information in addition to
             that shown by the -l flag.

     -w      Show the cryptographically generated address (CGA) parameters for
             the node.

RETURN VALUES
     The ndp command will exit with 0 on success, and non-zero on errors.
