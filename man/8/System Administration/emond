NAME
     emond â€“ Event Monitor Daemon

SYNOPSIS
     emond [-r path] [-c path]

DESCRIPTION
     emond accepts events from various services, runs them through a simple
     rules engine, and takes action. The actions can run commands; send email,
     or SMS messages.

     Options:

     -r path_to_rules
              Tells emond to look for rules files in the specified path. The
              path may refer to either a file or a directory. If the path refers
              to a directory, then all files with a .plist extension in that
              directory will be loaded.

     -c path_to_config
              Tells emond to look in specified path for its config file.
