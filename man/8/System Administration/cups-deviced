NAME
       cupsd-helper - cupsd helper programs (deprecated)

SYNOPSIS
       cups-deviced request-id limit user-id options
       cups-driverd cat ppd-name
       cups-driverd list request_id limit options
       cups-exec sandbox-profile [ -g group-id ] [ -n nice-value ] [ -u user-id
       ] /path/to/program argv0 ...  argvN

DESCRIPTION
       The cupsd-helper programs perform long-running operations on behalf of
       the scheduler, cupsd(8).  The cups-deviced helper program runs each CUPS
       backend(7) with no arguments in order to discover the available printers.

       The cups-driverd helper program lists all available printer drivers, a
       subset of "matching" printer drivers, or a copy of a specific driver PPD
       file.

       The cups-exec helper program runs backends, filters, and other programs.
       On macOS these programs are run in a secure sandbox.

FILES
       The cups-driverd program looks for PPD and driver information files in
       the following directories:

           /Library/Printers
           /opt/share/ppd
           /System/Library/Printers
           /usr/local/share/ppd
           /usr/share/cups/drv
           /usr/share/cups/model
           /usr/share/ppd

       PPD files can be compressed using the gzip(1) program or placed in
       compressed tar(1) archives to further reduce their size.

       Driver information files must conform to the format defined in
       ppdcfile(5).

NOTES
       CUPS printer drivers, backends, and PPD files are deprecated and will no
       longer be supported in a future feature release of CUPS.  Printers that
       do not support IPP can be supported using applications such as
       ippeveprinter(1).
