WATCHDOGD(8)                 System Manager's Manual                WATCHDOGD(8)

NAME
     watchdogd â€“ watchdog daemon

DESCRIPTION
     watchdogd ensures that the system is healthy and able to make forward
     progress throughout the system lifecycle.
     If watchdogd or the Watchdog KEXT determine that the system is unhealthy
     they will attempt to take corrective action and ultimately may panic the
     system to get it back to a usable state.

     This command is not intended to be invoked directly.
