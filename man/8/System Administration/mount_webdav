MOUNT_WEBDAV(8)              System Manager's Manual             MOUNT_WEBDAV(8)

NAME
     mount_webdav â€“ mount a WebDAV filesystem

SYNOPSIS
     mount_webdav [-s] [-S] [-i] [-v volume_name] [-o options]
                  [scheme://]host[:port][/path] node

DESCRIPTION
     The mount_webdav command mounts the WebDAV-enabled server directory at
     [scheme://]host[:port][/path] at the mount point indicated by node.

     The user and group IDs for all files and directories are set to unknown,
     and the permissions default to read, write and execute for user, group and
     other.

     The arguments and options are:

     -s      Require that authentication credentials be sent securely to the
             server.  Note: If this option is not set, sending authentication
             credentials insecurely to the server will be allowed but will be
             logged.

     -S      Suppresses all user interface including the authentication dialogs
             and the non-responsive ("disconnect") server dialogs. If the server
             connection becomes non-responsive, the file system is immediately
             unmounted when this option has been used.

     -i      Interactive mode, you are prompted for the username and password.

     -o      Options passed to mount(2) are specified with the -o option
             followed by a comma-separated string of options. See the mount(8)
             man page for possible options and their meanings. If connecting to
             a Class 1 compliant WebDAV server, the rdonly option will be set
             even if it was not specified because mount_webdav will not allow
             files to be opened with write access on servers which do not
             support the DAV LOCK method.

     -v volume_name
             Allows the volume_name attribute (ATTR_VOL_NAME) returned by
             getattrlist(2) to be specified. If the volume_name is not
             specified, the last path component name of the node path is used as
             the volume_name.

     [scheme://]host[:port][/path]
             The WebDAV-enabled server directory (collection resource) to mount
             as a volume.  The scheme, if specified, must be "http://" or
             "https://". If the scheme is not specified, then "http://" is used.
             If the port is not specified, then port 80 is used when the scheme
             is "http://" or port 443 is used when the scheme is "https://".  If
             the path is not specified, then the path "/" is used.

     node    Path to mount point. Note: The mount point directory must be
             created or exist before issuing the mount_webdav command.

EXAMPLES
     The following example illustrates how to mount the WebDAV-enabled server
     directory http://idisk.mac.com/membername/ at the mount point
     /Volumes/mntpnt/.  Note: The mountpoint directory /Volumes/mntpnt/ must be
     created before issuing the mount_webdav command.

           mount_webdav http://idisk.mac.com/membername/ /Volumes/mntpnt/

DIAGNOSTICS
     The mount_webdav utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
     Here is a list of common results (other error results not listed may be
     returned):

     0                  mount_webdav successfully mounted the server directory.

     [ENOENT]           The server directory could not be mounted by
                        mount_webdav because the node path is invalid.

     [ENODEV]           The server directory could not be mounted by
                        mount_webdav because it is not WebDAV-enabled or because
                        it does not exist, or because node does not have proper
                        access.

     [ECANCELED]        The server directory could not be mounted by
                        mount_webdav because the user did not provide proper
                        authentication credentials.

COMPATIBILITY
     As noted above, the -afd option is considered deprecated in Mac OS X 10.4
     and may not be supported in future releases. Use the
     FSMountServerVolumeSync() and FSMountServerVolumeAsync() APIs in
     CarbonCore/Files.h instead.

HISTORY
     The mount_webdav command first appeared Mac OS X Version 10.0. Support for
     HTTP Digest Access authentication was added in Mac OS X Version 10.1.1.
     Support for the https URL scheme, and for additional authentication methods
     and proxies supported by the CFNetwork framework were added in Mac OS X
     Version 10.4.
