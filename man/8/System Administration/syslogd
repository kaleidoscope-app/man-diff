SYSLOGD(8)                   System Manager's Manual                  SYSLOGD(8)

NAME
     syslogd – Apple System Log server

SYNOPSIS
     syslogd [-d] [-D] [-m mark_interval] [-l lib_path] [-db_max size]
             [-utmp_ttl time] [-mps_limit quota] [-dup_delay time]
             [-module_name {0|1}]

DESCRIPTION
     The syslogd server receives and processes log messages.  Several modules
     receive input messages through various channels, including UNIX domain
     sockets associated with the syslog(3), asl(3), and kernel printf APIs, and
     optionally on a UDP socket from network clients.

     The Apple System Log facility comprises the asl(3) API, a new syslogd
     server, the syslog(1) command-line utility, and a data store file manager,
     aslmanager(8).  The system supports structured and extensible messages,
     permitting advanced message browsing and management through search APIs and
     other components of the Apple system log facility.

     Log messages are retained in a data store, subject to automatic archival,
     and input filtering as described below, to simplify the task of locating
     log messages and to facilitate browsing and searching.  The data store is
     intended to become a replacement for the numerous log files that are
     currently found in various locations on the system.  Those files will be
     phased out in future versions of Mac OS.

     The following options are recognized:

     -d          Run syslogd in debugging mode.  The server stays attached to
                 the controlling terminal and prints debugging messages.

     -D          Start as a daemon.  This option forces syslogd to fork and have
                 the child process become a daemon.  Since syslogd is started by
                 launchd, this is not normally required.

     -m          Set the number of minutes between “mark” messages.  Mark
                 messages are normally disabled.  If -m is specified with no
                 arguments, mark messages will be written every 20 minutes.  The
                 “mark” facility is disabled if the setting is zero minutes.

     -db_max     Sets the size limit in bytes for individual files in the data
                 store.  The default value for -db_max is 25600000 bytes.  Files
                 are closed upon reaching the maximum size, and a new file is
                 opened for subsequent messages.

     -utmp_ttl   Sets the time-to-live in seconds for messages used by the
                 utmp(5), wtmp(5), and lastlog(5) subsystems.  The default is
                 31622400 seconds (approximately 1 year).  Note that if archival
                 is enabled (see the aslmanager(8) manual), these messages will
                 be copied to an archive after the regular time-to-live
                 interval, but will persist in the data store until their own
                 expiry time.

     -mps_limit  Sets the kernel quota for messages per second allowed by
                 syslogd.  Any messages in excess of the quota limit from any
                 process are ignored.  An error message is logged stating that
                 the kernel message quota has been exceeded, and that remaining
                 messages for the current second will be discarded.  The default
                 limit is 500 messages per second per process.  A value of 0
                 turns off the quota mechanism.

                 Note that this setting only limits the number of kernel
                 messages that will be saved by syslogd.  User processes are
                 limited to 36000 messages per hour.  The limit for a user
                 process is not enforced if a remote-control ASL filter is in
                 place for the process.

     -dup_delay  Sets the time to delay for coalescing duplicate message in log
                 files.  If a process logs multiple messages with the same text,
                 syslogd will wait for the specified period of time to coalesce
                 duplicates.  If identical messages arrive during this interval,
                 syslogd will print a message of the form:

                      May 7 12:34:56: --- last message repeated 17 times ---

                 The default delay time is 30 seconds.  Setting the value to 0
                 disables the coalescing mechanism.

     The remaining options of the form -module_name {0|1} may be used to disable
     (0) or enable (1) the action of several of syslogd 's internal modules.

     -asl_in      The “asl_in” module receives log messages on the UNIX domain
                  socket associated with the asl(3) API.  The module may be
                  disabled using -asl_in 0.  The module is normally enabled.

     -asl_action  The “asl_action” module examines the stream of received log
                  messages and acts upon them according to the rules specified
                  in the file /etc/asl.conf.  See asl.conf(5) for details.

     -klog_in     The “klog_in” module receives log messages on the UNIX domain
                  socket associated with the kernel logging API.  The module may
                  be disabled using -klog_in 0.  The module is normally enabled.

     -bsd_out     The “bsd_out” module examines the stream of received log
                  messages and acts upon them according to the rules specified
                  in the file /etc/syslog.conf.  See syslog.conf(5) for details.
                  This module exists for backward compatibility with previous
                  syslogd implementations.  Apple encourages use of the
                  syslog(1) and asl(3) search APIs over the use of the log files
                  that are specified in the /etc/syslog.conf file.  Future
                  versions of Mac OS will move functions that are currently
                  handled by the “bsd_out” module to the “asl_action” module.

     -udp_in      The “udp_in” module receives log messages on the UDP socket
                  associated with the Internet syslog message protocol.

                  This module is normally enabled, but is inactive.  The actual
                  UDP sockets are managed by launchd, and configured in the
                  syslogd configuration file
                  /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist.  In the
                  default configuration, launchd does not open any sockets for
                  the “syslog” UDP service, so no sockets are provided to the
                  “udp_in” module.  If no sockets are provided, the module
                  remains inactive.  A socket may be specified by adding the
                  following entry to the “Sockets” dictionary in the
                  com.apple.syslogd.plist file.

                             <key>NetworkListener</key>
                             <dict>
                                  <key>SockServiceName</key>
                                  <string>syslog</string>
                                  <key>SockType</key>
                                  <string>dgram</string>
                             </dict>

                  The module may be specifically disabled using the -udp_in 0
                  option.

     syslogd reinitializes in response to a HUP signal.

MESSAGE EXPIRY AND ARCHIVAL
     syslogd periodically invokes the aslmanager utility, which manages files in
     the ASL data store.  Files are removed or optionally copied to an archival
     directory after a (default) 2 day time-to-live.  See the aslmanager(8)
     manual for details.  syslogd invokes aslmanager shortly after it starts up,
     at midnight local time if it is running, and any time that a data store
     file reaches the -db_max size limit.

DATA STORE SECURITY
     Messages saved in the ASL message store are written to files in
     /var/log/asl.  The message files are given read access controls
     corresponding to the read UID and GID specified in the messages themselves.
     Read access UID and GID settings may be attached to messages using the
     asl(3) library by setting a value for the "ReadUID" and/or "ReadGID"
     message keys.  The file permissions prevent access-controlled messages from
     being read by unauthorized users.

     Although clients are generally free to use any value for the "Facility"
     message key, only processes running with UID 0 may log messages with a
     facility value of "com.apple.system", or with a value that has
     "com.apple.system" as a prefix.  Messages logged by non UID 0 processes
     that use "com.apple.system" as a facility value or prefix will be saved
     with the facility value "user".
