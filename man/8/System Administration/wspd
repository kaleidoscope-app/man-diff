NAME
     wspd â€“ search in smb share according to MS-WSP protocol

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/libexec/wspd [-sd]

DESCRIPTION
     The wspd program searches in a smb share, specified by MS-WSP
     specification.

     To activate the search it is needed to connect to the socket specified to
     the wspd and send a valid MS-WSP packet.  When reading back the response
     from the wspd socket, first DWROD (32bits) read is the size of the WSP
     response packet to recieve.

     The options are as follows:

     --s     The UNIX socket wspd listens to.

     --d     The delay between last connection was disconnected and the time
             wspd will close if no new connection arrived.
