SUMMARY
       htcacheclean is used to keep the size of mod_cache_disk's storage within
       a given size limit, or limit on inodes in use. This tool can run either
       manually or in daemon mode. When running in daemon mode, it sleeps in the
       background and checks the cache directory at regular intervals for cached
       content to be removed. You can stop the daemon cleanly by sending it a
       TERM or INT signal. When run manually, a once off check of the cache
       directory is made for cached content to be removed. If one or more URLs
       are specified, each URL will be deleted from the cache, if present.



OPTIONS
       -dinterval
              Daemonize and repeat cache cleaning every interval minutes. This
              option is mutually exclusive with the -D, -v and -r options. To
              shutdown the daemon cleanly, just send it a SIGTERM or SIGINT.

       -D     Do a dry run and don't delete anything. This option is mutually
              exclusive with the -d option. When doing a dry run and deleting
              directories with -t, the inodes reported deleted in the stats
              cannot take into account the directories deleted, and will be
              marked as an estimate.

       -v     Be verbose and print statistics. This option is mutually exclusive
              with the -d option.

       -r     Clean thoroughly. This assumes that the Apache web server is not
              running (otherwise you may get garbage in the cache). This option
              is mutually exclusive with the -d option and implies the -t
              option.

       -n     Be nice. This causes slower processing in favour of other
              processes. htcacheclean will sleep from time to time so that (a)
              the disk IO will be delayed and (b) the kernel can schedule other
              processes in the meantime.

       -t     Delete all empty directories. By default only cache files are
              removed, however with some configurations the large number of
              directories created may require attention. If your configuration
              requires a very large number of directories, to the point that
              inode or file allocation table exhaustion may become an issue, use
              of this option is advised.

       -ppath Specify path as the root directory of the disk cache. This should
              be the same value as specified with the CacheRoot directive.

       -Ppidfile
              Specify pidfile as the name of the file to write the process ID to
              when daemonized.

       -Rround
              Specify round as the amount to round sizes up to, to compensate
              for disk block sizes. Set to the block size of the cache
              partition.

       -llimit
              Specify limit as the total disk cache size limit. The value is
              expressed in bytes by default (or attaching B to the number).
              Attach K for Kbytes, M for MBytes or G for Gbytes.

       -Llimit
              Specify limit as the total disk cache inode limit. K, M or G
              suffix can also be used.

       -i     Be intelligent and run only when there was a modification of the
              disk cache. This option is only possible together with the -d
              option.

       -a     List the URLs currently stored in the cache. Variants of the same
              URL will be listed once for each variant.

       -A     List the URLs currently stored in the cache, along with their
              attributes in the following order: url, header size, body size,
              status, entity version, date, expiry, request time, response time,
              body present, head request.


DELETING A SPECIFIC URL
       If htcacheclean is passed one or more URLs, each URL will be deleted from
       the cache. If multiple variants of an URL exists, all variants would be
       deleted.


       When a reverse proxied URL is to be deleted, the effective URL is
       constructed from the Host header, the port, the path and the query. Note
       the '?' in the URL must always be specified explicitly, whether a query
       string is present or not. For example, an attempt to delete the path /
       from the server localhost, the URL to delete would be
       http://localhost:80/?.


LISTING URLS IN THE CACHE
       By passing the -a or -A options to htcacheclean, the URLs within the
       cache will be listed as they are found, one URL per line. The -A option
       dumps the full cache entry after the URL, with fields in the following
       order:



       url    The URL of the entry.

       header size
              The size of the header in bytes.

       body size
              The size of the body in bytes.

       status Status of the cached response.

       entity version
              The number of times this entry has been revalidated without being
              deleted.

       date   Date of the response.

       expiry Expiry date of the response.

       request time
              Time of the start of the request.

       response time
              Time of the end of the request.

       body present
              If 0, no body is stored with this request, 1 otherwise.

       head request
              If 1, the entry contains a cached HEAD request with no body, 0
              otherwise.


EXIT STATUS
       htcacheclean returns a zero status ("true") if all operations were
       successful, 1 otherwise. If an URL is specified, and the URL was cached
       and successfully removed, 0 is returned, 2 otherwise. If an error
       occurred during URL removal, 1 is returned.
