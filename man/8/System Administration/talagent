TALAGENT(8)                  System Manager's Manual                 TALAGENT(8)

NAME
     talagent â€“ helper agent for the Transparent App Lifecycle feature.

SYNOPSIS
     talagent [command [arguments]]

DESCRIPTION
     The talagent daemon provides services related to the Transparent App
     Lifecycle feature.  talagent may also be run manually as a command line
     tool to output information about persistent state.

     The options are as follows:

     -help
         Outputs usage information.

     -dump bundle_id_fragment
         Outputs the persistent state of an application whose bundle ID contains
         the given fragment, case insensitive ("textedit" for example).  You may
         also pass a path directly to the app's persistent state directory,
         usually in ~/Library/Saved Application State.

     -launch bundle_id
         This launches an app (in this case, TextEdit) in a manner approximating
         how apps get launched at login. You can pass either a bundle ID
         fragment or a path to an app.  The app is maintained stopped until you
         hit return in the launching window (or until it receives SIGCONT). This
         is the easiest way to test the login scenario without needing to log
         in.

     -casinfo [ASN]
         With no arguments, outputs summary information about all apps. With one
         argument (an ASN), outputs the CAS record for that app.

     -memory_pressure
         Simulates memory pressure, which may cause apps that support automatic
         termination to exit. This does not actually allocate any memory.

     -refresh_encryption
         Rotates the bitmap encryption key, and attempts to cross-encrypt all
         existing window bitmaps under the new key. This is done periodically by
         talagent.
