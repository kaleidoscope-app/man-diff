CHECKGID(8)                  System Manager's Manual                 CHECKGID(8)

NAME
     checkgid â€“ validate group identifiers

SYNOPSIS
     checkgid group ...

DESCRIPTION
     Given one or more group identifers on the command line (e.g., "httpd" or
     "#-1"), figure out whether they'll be valid for the server to use at run-
     time.

     If a groupname isn't found, or we can't setgid() to it, return -1.  If all
     groups are valid, return 0.

     This may need to be run as the superuser for the setgid() to succeed;
     running it as any other user may result in a false negative.
