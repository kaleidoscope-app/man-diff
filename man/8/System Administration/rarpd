RARPD(8)                     System Manager's Manual                    RARPD(8)

NAME
     rarpd – Reverse ARP Daemon

SYNOPSIS
     rarpd [-adf] [interface]

DESCRIPTION
     Rarpd services Reverse ARP requests on the Ethernet connected to interface.
     Upon receiving a request, rarpd maps the target hardware address to an IP
     address via its name, which must be present in both the ethers(5) and
     hosts(5) databases.  If a host does not exist in both databases, the
     translation cannot proceed and a reply will not be sent.

     Additionally, a request is honored only if the server (i.e., the host that
     rarpd is running on) can "boot" the target; that is, if the directory
     /tftpboot/ipaddr exists, where is the target IP address.

     In normal operation, rarpd forks a copy of itself and runs in the
     background.  Anomalies and errors are reported via syslog(3).

OPTIONS
     -a      Listen on all the Ethernets attached to the system.  If ‘-a’ is
             omitted, an interface must be specified.

     -d      Run in debug mode, with all the output to stderr.  This option
             implies the -f option.

     -f      Run in the foreground.

FILES
     /etc/ethers
     /etc/hosts
     /tftpboot
