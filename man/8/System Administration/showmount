SHOWMOUNT(8)                 System Manager's Manual                SHOWMOUNT(8)

NAME
     showmount â€“ show remote NFS mounts on host

SYNOPSIS
     showmount [-Ae36] [-p -2|3|4] [-a | -d] [host]

DESCRIPTION
     showmount shows status information about the NFS server on host.  By
     default it prints the names of all hosts that have NFS file systems mounted
     on the host. See NFS: Network File System Protocol Specification, RFC 1094,
     Appendix A, and NFS: Network File System Version 3 Protocol Specification,
     Appendix I, for a detailed description of the protocol.

     -A      Search for NFS servers advertised via Bonjour.

     -a      List all mount points in the form: host:dirpath

     -d      List directory paths of mount points instead of hosts.

     -e      Show the host's exports list.

     -3      Use mount protocol Version 3, compatible with NFS Version 3.

     -6      Use only IPv6 addresses to contact servers.

     -p      Ping NFS server on the host based on provided version (2,3 or 4)
             using the NULL procedure.

SEE ALSO
     mount(1), mountd(8), nfsd(8), mDNSResponder(8)

BUGS
     The mount daemon running on the server only has an idea of the actual
     mounts, since the NFS server is stateless.  showmount will only display the
     information as accurately as the mount daemon reports it.

HISTORY
     The showmount utility first appeared in 4.4BSD.
