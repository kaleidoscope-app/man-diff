NAME
       snlatency - Measure Xsan Volume network latency

SYNOPSIS
       snlatency pathname [repeat]

DESCRIPTION
       The snlatency program allows measuring the round trip latency from the
       Xsan client to  the FSM process on the MDC host.  The file system to
       measure is selected via the pathname parameter.

       snlatency uses a special RPC to the MDC in a loop to measure the time to
       send the message, the time for the FSM process to service the request,
       and the time to send the response back up to the system call level.  The
       average of repeat calls is averaged and the latencies printed out in
       micro seconds.

       If the MDC is not local, then the NTP clock algorithm is used to adjust
       for the difference between the two host's clocks before calculating the
       results, it is not used when the MDC the same host.  The reason for this
       is that the NTP algorithm assumes the latency in both directions is the
       same and in effect averages them out.  Comparing the latencies seen
       between the client local to the MDC and remote clients will show how much
       of the latency is caused by network infrastructure.

EXIT VALUES
       snlatency will return 0 on success and non-zero on failure.
