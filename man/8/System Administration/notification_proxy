notification_proxy(8)        System Manager's Manual       notification_proxy(8)

NAME
     notification_proxy â€“ notification server

SYNOPSIS
     notification_proxy

DESCRIPTION
     notification_proxy enables a trusted remote Mac to read/write notifications
     on this Mac.  Trust requires that this Mac explicitly pair with the remote
     Mac.  The daemon is started automatically by launchd upon the trusted Mac
     requesting a connection to this service.

     This daemon also allows an untrusted remote Mac to read/write notifications
     while this Mac is still in setup. Once this Mac exits device setup, trust
     is required.

     This command is not intended to be invoked directly.

SEE ALSO
     notify(3).
