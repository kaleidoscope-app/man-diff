SLAPDN(8C)                                                            SLAPDN(8C)



NAME
       slapdn - Check a list of string-represented LDAP DNs based on schema
       syntax

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/slapdn [-d_debug-level] [-f_slapd.conf] [-F_confdir] [-N|-P]
       [-o_option[=value]] [-v] DN [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Slapdn is used to check the conformance of a DN based on the schema
       defined in slapd(8) and that loaded via slapd.conf(5).  It opens the
       slapd.conf(5) configuration file or the slapd-config (5) backend, reads
       in the schema definitions, and then parses the DN list given on the
       command-line.

OPTIONS
       -d_debug-level
              enable debugging messages as defined by the specified debug-level;
              see slapd(8) for details.

       -f_slapd.conf
              specify an alternative slapd.conf(5) file.

       -F_confdir
              specify a config directory.  If both -f and -F are specified, the
              config file will be read and converted to config directory format
              and written to the specified directory.  If neither option is
              specified, an attempt to read the default config directory will be
              made before trying to use the default config file. If a valid
              config directory exists then the default config file is ignored.

       -N     only output a normalized form of the DN, suitable to be used in a
              normalization tool; incompatible with -P.

       -o_option[=value]
              Specify an option with a(n optional) value.  Possible generic
              options/values are:

                     syslog=<subsystems>  (see `-s' in slapd(8))
                     syslog-level=<level> (see `-S' in slapd(8))
                     syslog-user=<user>   (see `-l' in slapd(8))


       -P     only output a prettified form of the DN, suitable to be used in a
              check and beautification tool; incompatible with -N.

       -v     enable verbose mode.

EXAMPLES
       To check a DN give the command:

            /usr/sbin/slapdn -f //etc/openldap/slapd.conf -v DN
