MAKEWHATIS(8)                System Manager's Manual               MAKEWHATIS(8)

NAME
     makewhatis â€“ create whatis database

SYNOPSIS
     makewhatis [-a] [-i column] [-n name] [-o file] [-v] [-L] [directories ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The makewhatis utility collects the names and short descriptions from all
     the unformatted man pages in the directories and puts them into a file used
     by the whatis(1) and apropos(1) commands.  Directories may be separated by
     colons instead of spaces.  If no directories are specified, the contents of
     the MANPATH environment variable will be used, or if that is not set, the
     default directory /usr/share/man will be processed.

     The options are as follows:

     -a               Appends to the output file(s) instead of replacing them.
                      The output will be sorted with duplicate lines removed,
                      but may have obsolete entries.

     -i column        Indents the description by column characters.  The default
                      value is 24.

     -n name          Uses name instead of whatis.

     -o file          Outputs all lines to the file instead of */man/whatis.

     -v               Makes makewhatis more verbose about what it is doing.

     -L               Process only localized subdirectories corresponding to the
                      locale specified in the standard environment variables.

ENVIRONMENT
     LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG
                  These variables control what subdirectories will be processed
                  if the -L option is used.

     MACHINE      If set, its value is used to override the current machine type
                  when searching machine specific subdirectories.

     MANPATH      Determines the set of directories to be processed if none are
                  given on the command line.

FILES
     /usr/share/man      Default directory to process if the MANPATH environment
                         variable is not set.
     */man/whatis        The default output file.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The makewhatis utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
