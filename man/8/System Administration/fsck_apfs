FSCK_APFS(8)                 System Manager's Manual                FSCK_APFS(8)

NAME
     fsck_apfs â€“ APFS consistency check

SYNOPSIS
     fsck_apfs [-n | -y] [-q] [-l] [-s] [-S] [-o] device

DESCRIPTION
     The fsck_apfs utility verifies and repairs APFS containers and volumes.

     fsck_apfs checks the specified APFS containers and volumes and tries to
     repair all detected inconsistencies.

     Because of inconsistencies between the block device and the buffer cache,
     the raw device should always be used.

     In its current state, fsck_apfs checks the integrity of various container
     data structures.

     The options are as follows:

           -q      Causes fsck_apfs to quickly check whether the device is
                   `clean'. If device is an APFS volume, fsck_apfs will quickly
                   check the APFS container and the specified APFS volume.  If
                   device is an APFS container, fsck_apfs will quickly check the
                   APFS container and all the APFS volumes in it.  By default,
                   no repairs are attempted during a quick check.

           -n      Never attempt to repair any damage that is found.

           -y      Always attempt to repair any damage that is found.

           -l      Enable live verification mode.  This makes it possible to
                   check an APFS container which is currently mounted read-
                   write, although no repairs can be made. Note that live
                   verification mode may cause your system to stop responding
                   until fsck_apfs completes.

           -s      Print space verification summary.

           -S      Skip iteration of snapshots (top-level snapshot structures
                   will still be checked), although no repairs can be made.

           -o      Repair overallocations; please do not run an older fsck_apfs
                   on newer systems with this option.

EXIT STATUS
     fsck_apfs exits with 0 on success, and >0 if error occurs.
