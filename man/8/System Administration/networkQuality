NAME
     networkQuality â€“ Network quality testing tool

SYNOPSIS
     networkQuality [-chksv] [-C configuration URL] [-I interface] [-r host]

DESCRIPTION
     networkQuality allows for measuring the different aspects of Network
     Quality, including:

     Maximal capacity (often described as speed)

     The responsiveness of the connection. Responsiveness measures the quality
     of your network by the number of roundtrips completed per minute (RPM)
     under working conditions. See https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212313

     Other aspects of the connection that affect the quality of experience.

     NOTE: This tool will connect to the Internet to perform its tests. This
     will use data on your Internet service plan.

     For more details about the RPM score and the methodology around the
     testing, see
     https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-cpaasch-ippm-responsiveness/

     The following options are available:

     -C configuration URL/path
              Use custom configuration URL or path (with scheme file://). See
              https://github.com/network-quality/server for server
              implementation details.

     -I interface
              Bind test to interface (e.g., en0, pdp_ip0,...)

              If not specified, the default interface will be used.

     -r host  Connect to host or IP, overriding DNS for initial config request

     -c       Produce computer-readable output.

     -h       Show help

     -k       Disable verification of the server identity via TLS.

     -s       Run tests sequentially instead of parallel upload/download.

     -v       Verbose output.
