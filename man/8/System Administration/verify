VERIFY(8)                    System Manager's Manual                   VERIFY(8)




NAME
       verify - Postfix address verification server

SYNOPSIS
       verify [generic Postfix daemon options]

DESCRIPTION
       The verify(8) address verification server maintains a record of what
       recipient addresses are known to be deliverable or undeliverable.

       Addresses are verified by injecting probe messages into the Postfix
       queue. Probe messages are run through all the routing and rewriting
       machinery except for final delivery, and are discarded rather than being
       deferred or bounced.

       Address verification relies on the answer from the nearest MTA for the
       specified address, and will therefore not detect all undeliverable
       addresses.

       The verify(8) server is designed to run under control by the Postfix
       master server. It maintains an optional persistent database.  To avoid
       being interrupted by "postfix stop" in the middle of a database update,
       the process runs in a separate process group.

       The verify(8) server implements the following requests:

       update address status text
              Update the status and text of the specified address.

       query address
              Look up the status and text for the specified address.  If the
              status is unknown, a probe is sent and an "in progress" status is
              returned.

SECURITY
       The address verification server is not security-sensitive. It does not
       talk to the network, and it does not talk to local users.  The verify
       server can run chrooted at fixed low privilege.

       The address verification server can be coerced to store unlimited amounts
       of garbage. Limiting the cache expiry time trades one problem (disk space
       exhaustion) for another one (poor response time to client requests).

       With Postfix version 2.5 and later, the verify(8) server no longer uses
       root privileges when opening the address_verify_map cache file. The file
       should now be stored under the Postfix-owned data_directory.  As a
       migration aid, an attempt to open a cache file under a non-Postfix
       directory is redirected to the Postfix-owned data_directory, and a
       warning is logged.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Problems and transactions are logged to syslogd(8).

BUGS
       Address verification probe messages add additional traffic to the mail
       queue.  Recipient verification may cause an increased load on down-stream
       servers in the case of a dictionary attack or a flood of backscatter
       bounces.  Sender address verification may cause your site to be
       blacklisted by some providers.

       If the persistent database ever gets corrupted then the world comes to an
       end and human intervention is needed. This violates a basic Postfix
       principle.

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
       Changes to main.cf are not picked up automatically, as verify(8)
       processes are long-lived. Use the command "postfix reload" after a
       configuration change.

       The text below provides only a parameter summary. See postconf(5) for
       more details including examples.
