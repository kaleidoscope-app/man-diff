NAME
     imklaunchagent

DESCRIPTION
     imklaunchagent is automatically invoked to launch input methods that are
     selected via direct user interaction. It is not intended to be invoked via
     other means and must not be terminated. imklaunchagent monitors abnormal
     behavior and will disallow an input method from launching if it repeatedly
     terminates unexpectedly within a short timespan.
