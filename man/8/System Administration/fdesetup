NAME
     fdesetup â€“ FileVault configuration tool

SYNOPSIS
     fdesetup verb [options]

DESCRIPTION
     fdesetup is used to enable or disable FileVault, to list, add, or remove
     enabled FileVault users, and to obtain status about the current state of
     FileVault. Most commands require root access and need to be authenticated
     with either a FileVault password, a personal recovery key (if enabled), and
     in some cases the private key from the installed institutional recovery
     key.  Some status related commands can be run from a non-root session.

     Certain commands on CoreStorage volumes allow you to authenticate and
     unlock by providing the -key option followed by the path to a keychain file
     containing the private key of the installed institutional recovery key.  Do
     not include the certificate in this keychain.

     By default, when enabling FileVault fdesetup will only return a personal
     recovery key. Given the proper certificate information, fdesetup can
     install an institutional recovery key.  You can also set it up without
     creating a personal recovery key using the -norecoverykey option, though
     this is not recommended unless you are also installing an institutional
     recovery key.  On APFS volumes, if you already have a personal recovery key
     created from a previous enablement, it will not remove or create a new
     personal recovery key, allowing you to reuse the existing key.  Either type
     of keys can be added or changed at a later time.

     With the -keychain option, an institutional recovery key can be set up by
     placing an X.509 asymmetric public certificate in the
     /Library/Keychains/FileVaultMaster.keychain file. security create-
     filevaultmaster-keychain can be used to create the keychain. Alternatively
     a certificate can be passed in by using the -certificate option and
     entering the path to the DER encoded certificate file. In this case the
     FileVaultMaster.keychain file will be created using the certificate. With
     your .cer file, the optional certificate data can be obtained using the
     base64 tool.  For example: 'base64 /path/to/mycert.cer > /mynewdata.txt',
     at which point you would copy the data string contained in the text file
     and place it into the Certificate <data></data> value area of the property
     list.  The certificate should be self signed, and the common name must be
     "FileVault Recovery Key"

     Because the user password may not be immediately available, read the
     DEFERRED ENABLEMENT section below for information on how to delay enabling
     FileVault until the user logs in or out.

     The status command will indicate if FileVault is On or Off.  If a FileVault
     master keychain is installed into the /Library/Keychains folder it will
     also report this back.  Note that this, by itself, does not indicate
     whether or not FileVault has been set up with an institutional recovery
     key.  The -extended option will display extended status information,
     including the time remaining for encrypting or decrypting.  The calculation
     of this remaining time may take a few minutes and is only an approximate
     value.

     The list command will display the short names and UUIDs of enabled
     FileVault users. You can use the -extended option to display a full list of
     existing user types along with some additional information.  This
     information will include if the recovery key was escrowed, though note that
     it will show "Yes" even if the information has not yet been successfully
     sent to the server.  You can also use the -offline option to get a list of
     currently locked and offline CoreStorage FileVault volumes.  You can use
     this information as part of the haspersonalrecoverykey or
     hasinstitutionalrecoverykey commands.

     The remove command will remove a user from FileVault given either the user
     name or the FileVault UUID.

     The sync command synchronizes Open Directory attributes (e.g. user
     pictures) with appropriate FileVault users, and removes FileVault users
     that were removed from Open Directory.   In most cases these changes will
     already be updated in FileVault.  sync does not add users to FileVault.

     Use the haspersonalrecoverykey or hasinstitutionalrecoverykey commands to
     see if FileVault has a personal or institutional recovery key set up.  If
     FileVault is active and the key is set, by default these commands will
     return "true" or "false".  Note that "false" may also be returned if any
     error occurs, or if FileVault is not yet fully enabled.   You can use the
     device option to specify either a mount path (e.g. /Volumes/myvolume), a
     bsd name identifier (e.g. disk0), or Logical Volume or Logical Volume
     Family UUID (obtained using either the list command, or using diskutil(8)).
     If you specify a device parameter and it finds the institutional recovery
     key, a hex representation of the public key hash will be returned in lieu
     of "true".

     If a user currently has the system unlocked using the recovery key, the
     usingrecoverykey command will return "true".

     The changerecovery command changes or adds either the personal or
     institutional recovery key.  You can only have one recovery key of each
     type, so any associated existing key will be removed.  The removerecovery
     command will remove any existing recovery key of the type specified.  It is
     not recommended that you remove all recovery keys since, if you lose your
     FileVault password, you may not be able to access your information.   On
     APFS volumes using 10.14 or later, the existing recovery key can be used as
     authentication to change or remove the personal recovery key.

     On supported hardware, fdesetup allows restart of a FileVault-enabled
     system without requiring unlock during the subsequent boot using the
     authrestart command. WARNING: FileVault protections are reduced during
     authenticated restarts. In particular, fdesetup deliberately stores at
     least one additional copy of a permanent FDE (full disk encryption) unlock
     key in both system memory and (on supported systems) the System Management
     Controller (SMC).  fdesetup must be run as root and itself prompts for a
     password to unlock the FileVault root volume.  Use pmset
     destroyfvkeyonstandby to prevent saving the key across standby modes. Once
     authrestart is authenticated, it launches shutdown(8) and, upon successful
     unlock, the unlock key will be removed.  You can also use this as an option
     to the enable command if the system supports this feature.  The
     supportsauthrestart command will check the system to see if it supports the
     authrestart command option, however you should note that even if this
     returns true, FileVault must still be enabled for authrestart to work.

VERBS
     Each command verb is listed with its description and individual arguments.

                [-authrestart] [-keychain | [-certificate path_to_cer_file]]
                [[-defer file_path] [-forceatlogin max_cancel_attempts]
                [-dontaskatlogout]] [-norecoverykey] [-verbose]
                Enables FileVault.  This command will fail if no recovery
                partition was found on your disk.   Additionally, all Secure
                Token users must contain valid passwords.

     disable    [-verbose]
                Disables FileVault.

     status     [-extended] [-verbose]
                Returns current status about FileVault.   On APFS volumes, the
                -extended option will give continuous updates and estimated
                completion times during encryption and decryption phases.

     sync
                Synchronizes information from Open Directory to FileVault.

     add        -usertoadd added_username ... | -inputplist [-verbose]
                Adds additional FileVault users.   A FileVault user password or
                recovery key must be used to authenticate.

     remove     -uuid user_uuid | -user username [-verbose]
                Removes enabled user from FileVault.   It will not remove the
                user if it's the last OS user on the volume.

     changerecovery -personal | -institutional -user [[-keychain] |
                [-certificate path_to_cer_file]] [-key path_to_keychain_file]
                [-inputplist] [-verbose]
                Adds or updates the current recovery key.   Either personal
                and/or institutional options must be specified.  When changing
                the personal recovery key, the updated personal recovery key
                will be automatically generated.   When changing either key, the
                old value will be removed and replaced.  On CoreStorage volumes
                the -key option can be used to unlock FileVault.   More
                information on this is described elsewhere in this document.

     removerecovery -personal -user | -institutional [[-key
                path_to_keychain_file] | [-inputplist]] [-verbose]
                Removes the current recovery key.   Either personal and/or
                institutional options must be specified.  The -key option can be
                optionally used to unlock FileVault.  More information on this
                is described elsewhere in this document.

     authrestart [-inputplist] [-delayminutes number_of_minutes_to_delay]
                [-verbose]
                If FileVault is enabled on the current volume, it restarts the
                system, bypassing the initial unlock.   The optional
                -delayminutes option can be used to delay the restart command
                for a set number of minutes.  A value of 0 represents
                'immediately', and a value of -1 represents 'never'.  The
                command may not work on all systems.

     isactive   [-verbose]
                Returns status 0 if FileVault is enabled along with the string
                "true".  Will return status 1 if FileVault is Off, along with
                "false".

     haspersonalrecoverykey [-device] [-verbose]
                Returns the string "true" if FileVault contains a personal
                recovery key.

     hasinstitutionalrecoverykey [-device] [-verbose]
                By default, this will return the string "true" if FileVault
                contains an institutional recovery key.   On CoreStorage volumes
                specified using the --device option, this will return the hex
                representation of the public key hash instead of "true".   The
                hash option is not supported for APFS volumes.   This will
                return "false" if there is no institutional recovery key
                installed.

     usingrecoverykey [-verbose]
                Returns the string "true" if FileVault is currently unlocked
                using the personal recovery key.

     supportsauthrestart
                Returns the string "true" if the system supports the
                authenticated restart option.   Note that even if true is
                returned, this does not necessarily mean that authrestart will
                work since it requires that FileVault be enabled.

     validaterecovery [-inputplist] [-verbose]
                Returns the string "true" if the personal recovery key is
                validated.  The validated recovery key must be in the form xxxx-
                xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx.

     showdeferralinfo
                If the defer mode is set, this will show the current settings.

     version
                Displays current tool version.

OPTIONS
     -defer file_path
             Defer enabling FileVault until the user password is obtained, and
             recovery key and system information will be written to the file
             path.

     -user user_shortname
             Short user name.

     -uuid user_uuid
             User UUID in canonical form: 11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555.

     -usertoadd added_user
             Additional user(s) to be added to FileVault.

     -inputplist
             Acquire configuration information from stdin when enabling or
             adding users to FileVault.

     -prompt
             Always prompt for information.

     -forcerestart
             Force a normal restart after FileVault has been successfully
             configured.   Only valid for CoreStorage volumes.

     -authrestart
             Do an authenticated restart after a successful enable occurs.

     -outputplist
             Outputs the recovery key and additional system information to
             stdout in a plist dictionary.  If the recovery key changes, the
             dictionary will also contain a Change key and the EnableDate key
             will contain the date of the change.   Where possible, you should
             avoid writing this file to a persistent location since it may pose
             additional security risk, and at the very least, securely remove
             the file as soon as possible.

     -keychain
             Use the institutional recovery key stored in
             /Library/Keychains/FileVaultMaster.keychain.

     -certificate path_to_cer_file
             Use the certificate data located at the path. Any existing
             /Library/Keychains/FileVaultMaster.keychain file will be moved away
             with the location logged in the system log.  Do not set this option
             if your certificate data is located in the input plist information.
             The common name of the certificate must be "FileVault Recovery Key"

     -key path_to_keychain_file
             Use the keychain file located at the path containing the private
             key for the currently installed institutional recovery key to
             unlock and authenticate FileVault.

     -norecoverykey
             Do not return a personal recovery key.   On APFS volumes, you can
             use this option to reuse an existing recovery key previously
             created.

     -forceatlogin max_cancel_attempts
             When using the -defer option, prompt the designated user at login
             time to enable FileVault.  The user has at most max_cancel_attempts
             to cancel and bypass enabling FileVault before it will be required
             to log in.   If this value is 0, the user's next login will require
             that they enable FileVault before being allowed to use their
             account.   Other special values include -1 to ignore this option,
             and 9999, which means that the user should never be forced to
             enable FileVault (instead the user will just be prompted each time
             at login until FileVault is enabled).

     -dontaskatlogout
             When using the -defer option, the default action will be to prompt
             the designated user at user logout time for their password in order
             to enable FileVault.  If this option is used, the logout enablement
             window is not shown.  The assumption is that you are instead using
             the -forceatlogin option to prompt at user login time to enable
             FileVault.

     -extended
             Return extended output information for certain commands.   When
             using this while checking status on enabling or disabling FileVault
             on APFS volumes, a rough estimate of the time remaining will be
             displayed.  This value may take a few minutes to initially
             calculate.   Hit Ctrl-C to stop the status display.

     -offline
             Display the current offline and locked FileVault volumes. Currently
             only used for the list command.

     -device bsd_name_or_mount_path_or_lvf_or_lv_UUID
             Device location to be applied for the command.  This can be in the
             form "disk1", "/Volumes/MyVolume", or when asking for a CoreStorage
             recovery user, a UUID for the Logical Volume or Logical Volume
             Family of a volume.   Not all commands can use this option.

     -delayminutes number_of_minutes_to_delay
             The integer number of minutes to delay the authenticated restart.
             If this option is not set or the value is 0, the auth restart will
             happen immediately.   A value of -1 will never attempt to
             automatically restart; instead the auth restart operation will
             occur whenever the user next restarts.

DEFERRED ENABLEMENT
     The -defer option can be used with the enable command option to delay
     enabling FileVault until after the current (or next) local user logs in or
     out, thus avoiding the need to enter a password when the tool is run.
     Depending on the options set, the user will either be prompted at logout
     time for the password, or the user will be prompted to enable FileVault
     when they log in. If the volume is not already a CoreStorage volume, the
     system may need to be restarted to start the encryption process. Dialogs
     are automatically dismissed and canceled after 60 seconds if no interaction
     occurs.

     The -defer option sets up a single user to be added to FileVault. If there
     was no user specified (e.g. without the -user option), then the currently
     logged in user will be added to the configuration and becomes the
     designated user. If there is no user specified and no users are logged in
     at the time of configuration, then the next user that logs in will become
     the designated user.

     As recovery key information is not generated until the user password is
     obtained, the -defer option requires a path where this information will be
     written to. The property list file will be created as a root-only readable
     file and should be placed in a secure location.  You can use the
     showdeferralinfo command to view the current deferral configuration
     information.

     Options that can be used in conjunction with the -defer option include:
     -keychain, -certificate, -forcerestart, -forceatlogin, -dontaskatlogout,
     -user, and -norecoverykey.

     Note that if the designated user is being prompted at logout to enable
     FileVault, and doesn't complete the setup, FileVault will not be enabled,
     but the configuration will remain and be used again for the designated
     user's next logout (or login if the -forceatlogin option is enabled),
     thereby 'nagging' the user to enable FileVault.   When using the
     -forceatlogin option, the user is given a certain number of attempts to
     enable FileVault, in which they can cancel the operation and continue to
     use their system without FileVault.  When the number of cancel attempts is
     reached, the user will not be able to log into their account until
     FileVault is enabled.    The current value of the user's remaining attempts
     can be viewed using the showdeferralinfo command.   Special values for the
     -forceatlogin option include setting it to '0' to force the enablement
     immediately at next login, a '-1' disables the check entirely, and a
     special value of '9999' means that the user will never be required to
     enable FileVault, though it will continually prompt the user until
     FileVault is enabled.   If a personal recovery key is used, the user should
     probably be warned ahead of time that, upon successful enablement, they
     will need to write down and keep in a safe place the FileVault recovery key
     shown on the screen.

     The designated user must be a local user (or a mobile account user).

     To remove an active deferred enablement configuration, you can use the
     disable command, even if FileVault is not currently enabled.

     Starting with macOS 10.15, when using the -defer option at logout time,
     fdesetup may not finish the enablement until after the system returns to
     the login window.  If you are displaying the recovery key to the user, it
     will not appear until the enable operation has completed.

             to certain comamnds.

     Care should be taken with passwords that may be used within files.
     Precautions should be taken in your scripts to try to pass plist data
     directly from one tool to another to avoid writing this information to a
     persistent location.

AUTHORIZATION POLICY
     Starting in macOS 10.15, you cannot use fdesetup to enable FileVault
     encryption unless one of the following occurs:

     1) The responsible application is authorized for "Full Disk Access" in the
     System Settings Privacy pane.

     2) System Integrity Protection (SIP) is disabled.

     3) fdesetup was run due to a device configuration profile installation that
     was either DEP enrolled or MDM user approved.

     4) The user has explicitly authorized the enablement of FileVault via a
     confirmation dialog.

EXAMPLES
     fdesetup enable
              Enable FileVault after prompting for an OpenDirectory user name
              and password, and return the personal recovery key.

     fdesetup enable -keychain -norecoverykey
              Enables FileVault using an institutional recovery key in the
              FileVaultMaster.keychain file. No personal recovery key will be
              created.

     fdesetup enable -defer /MykeyAndInfo.plist
              Enables FileVault when the current user logs out and successfully
              enters their password and then writes the personal recovery key
              and other relevant information to the file.

     fdesetup enable -defer /MykeyAndInfo.plist -showrecoverykey -forceatlogin 3
              -dontaskatlogout
              Will prompt to enable FileVault when the user logs in, allowing a
              maximum of 3 aborted enable attempts before requiring FileVault be
              enabled.  After the 3 attempts, the user will not be able to log
              in to the client until either FileVault is enabled, or the
              deferral information is removed (via fdesetup disable).

     fdesetup enable -certificate /mycertfile.cer
              Enables FileVault with an institutional recovery key based off the
              certificate data in the DER encoded file. A
              FileVaultMaster.keychain file will be created automatically.

     fdesetup enable -inputplist < /someinfo.plist
              Enables FileVault using information from the property list read in
              from stdin.

     fdesetup changerecovery -institutional -keychain
              Adds or updates the institutional recovery key from the existing
              FileVaultMaster.keychain.

     fdesetup status
              Shows the current status of FileVault.

     fdesetup list -extended
              Lists the current FileVault users, including recovery key records,
              in an extended format.

     fdesetup remove -uuid A6C75639-1D98-4F19-ACD5-1892BAE27991
              Removes the user with the UUID from the FileVault users list.

              and active.

     fdesetup add -usertoadd betty
              Adds the user betty to the existing FileVault setup.

     fdesetup changerecovery -personal -inputplist < /authinfo.plist
              Changes the existing recovery key and generates a new recovery
              key.

     fdesetup validaterecovery
              Gets the existing personal recovery key and returns "true" if the
              recovery key appears to be valid.
