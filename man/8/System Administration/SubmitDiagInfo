NAME
     SubmitDiagInfo â€“ sends diagnostic information to Apple

SYNOPSIS
     SubmitDiagInfo

DESCRIPTION
     SubmitDiagInfo is a system process which runs periodically.  If the user
     has opted-in for automatic reporting of diagnostic and usage information,
     then SubmitDiagInfo collects and sends to Apple any recent diagnostic
     information which has not yet been sent to Apple.  SubmitDiagInfo also
     cleans up any diagnostic and usage information which was created more than
     one month ago and is no longer needed.

     Sending diagnostic and usage reports to Apple helps us improve the quality
     and performance of our products and services.  It helps Apple identify
     common usage trends and issues that enable us to allocate our resources
     efficiently, and it helps us provide better support services to you and
     other customers.  All of the diagnostic and usage information is collected
     anonymously from your computer in a way that does not personally identify
     you.  Reports may include the following information:

     -   Details about application or system crashes, freezes, or kernel panics.
     -   Information about events on your computer (e.g. whether a certain
         function, such as waking your computer was successful or not).
     -   Usage information (e.g. data about how Apple and third party software,
         hardware and services are being used).

     Automatic reporting of diagnostic information is off by default and no
     information is sent to Apple unless a user has opted-in to automatic
     collection of diagnostic information.  A user is offered the opportunity to
     opt-in for automatic collection of additional diagnostic and usage
     information after the user has manually sent a crash, hang or panic report
     to Apple.  Users may at any time opt in or out of automatic reporting in
     the Security & Privacy pane of the System Preferences application under the
     "Privacy" tab.

     All diagnostic and usage information which is eligible for automatic
     reporting is visible in the Console application under the "DIAGNOSTIC AND
     USAGE INFORMATION" heading in the application's sidebar.  (The information
     appears here even if a user has not yet opted-in for automatic reporting.)
     For security purposes, some system diagnostic information will only be
     visible to admin users and will only be submitted when an admin user is
     logged in.

     Users who need technical support should use http://www.apple.com/support or
     other authorized support channels.  Developers who are ADC members should
     submit bug reports using http://bugreporter.apple.com in order to allow for
     two way communication between Apple and the bug reporter.
