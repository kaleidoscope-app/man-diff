IOREG(8)                     System Manager's Manual                    IOREG(8)

NAME
     ioreg â€“ show I/O Kit registry

SYNOPSIS
     ioreg [-abfilrtxy] [-c class] [-d depth] [-k key] [-n name] [-p plane]
           [-w width]

DESCRIPTION
     ioreg displays the I/O Kit registry.  It shows the hierarchical registry
     structure as an inverted tree.  The provider-client relationships among
     those objects is shown as follows:

     +-o provider
       |
       +-o client

     By default, object properties are not shown.  The use of the -c, -k, -l, or
     -n options cause ioreg to show properties for objects that match the
     specified criteria.

     By supplying the -r option, the user may specify the object which will
     appear at the root of the tree with the -c, -k, or -n options.  If root
     matches more than one object, multiple trees will be displayed.

     The options are as follows:

     -a    Archive the output in XML.

     -b    Show the object name in bold.

     -c    Show the object properties only if the object is an instance of, or
           derives from, the specified C++ class (e.g. IOService).

     -d    Limit tree traversal to the specified depth.  The depth limit is
           applied with respect to each subtree root individually.  Therefore,
           supplying a depth of 1 will cause ioreg to display only (sub)tree
           root nodes; children will not be shown.

     -f    Enable smart formatting.  ioreg knows how to format certain
           properties so that the output is more readable and meaningful,
           decoding data fields where appropriate.  Currently supported are
           `reg', `assigned-addresses', `slot-names', `ranges', `interrupt-map',
           `interrupt-parent`, and `interrupts'.

     -i    Show the object inheritance.

     -k    Show the object properties only if the object has the specified key.
           Substrings do not match; the specified key must be a full property
           name.

     -l    Show properties for all displayed objects.

     -n    Show the object properties only if the object has the specified name.
           The object location, if any, is considered part of the name, thus
           pci@f0000000 and pci@f4000000 are distinct names.

     -p    Traverse the registry over the specified plane.  The default plane
           value is ``IOService''.  The other planes, such as ``IODeviceTree'',
           can be found under the ``IORegistryPlanes'' property of the root
           object (ioreg -d 1 -k IORegistryPlanes).

     -r    Show subtrees rooted by objects that match the specified criteria.
           If none of -c, -k, or -n are supplied, -r has no effect.

     -t    Show tree location of each subtree.  This option causes ioreg to
           display all nodes between the I/O Kit Root and the root of the
           displayed subtree, i.e. the subtree's parent, grandparent, etc.

     -w    Clip the output to the specified line width.  The default width value
           is the current screen size.  A value of 0 specifies an unlimited line
           width.

     -x    Show data and numbers as hexadecimal.
     Do not consider DriverKit classes with -c.
