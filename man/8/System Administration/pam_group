NAME
     pam_group – Group PAM module

SYNOPSIS
     [service-name] function-class control-flag pam_group [options]

DESCRIPTION
     The Group PAM module supports the account management function class.  In
     terms of the function-class parameter, this is the “account” class.

     The Group account management module permits or denies users based on their
     membership to a particular group (or groups) specified with the group
     option.  If no groups are specified the default group (“wheel”) will be
     used.

     The following options may be passed to this account management module:

     deny    Reverse the meaning of the test, i.e., reject the applicant if and
             only if he or she is a member of the specified group.  This can be
             useful to exclude certain groups of users from certain services.

     fail_safe
             If the specified group does not exist, or has no members, act as if
             it does exist and the applicant is a member.

     group=groupname
             Specify the name of the group to check.  This can be a comma-
             separated list (i.e. “group=admin,wheel”).

     root_only
             Skip this module entirely if the target account is not the
             superuser account.

     ruser   Check the membership of the applicant (PAM_RUSER), rather than the
             target account (PAM_USER)
