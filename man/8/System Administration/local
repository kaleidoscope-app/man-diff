LOCAL(8)                     System Manager's Manual                    LOCAL(8)




NAME
       local - Postfix local mail delivery

SYNOPSIS
       local [generic Postfix daemon options]

DESCRIPTION
       The local(8) daemon processes delivery requests from the Postfix queue
       manager to deliver mail to local recipients.  Each delivery request
       specifies a queue file, a sender address, a domain or host to deliver to,
       and one or more recipients.  This program expects to be run from the
       master(8) process manager.

       The local(8) daemon updates queue files and marks recipients as finished,
       or it informs the queue manager that delivery should be tried again at a
       later time. Delivery status reports are sent to the bounce(8), defer(8)
       or trace(8) daemon as appropriate.

CASE FOLDING
       All delivery decisions are made using the bare recipient name (i.e. the
       address localpart), folded to lower case.  See also under ADDRESS
       EXTENSION below for a few exceptions.

SYSTEM-WIDE AND USER-LEVEL ALIASING
       The system administrator can set up one or more system-wide
       sendmail-style alias databases.  Users can have sendmail-style ~/.forward
       files.  Mail for name is delivered to the alias name, to destinations in
       ~name/.forward, to the mailbox owned by the user name, or it is sent back
       as undeliverable.

       The system administrator can specify a comma/space separated list of
       ~/.forward like files through the forward_path configuration parameter.
       Upon delivery, the local delivery agent tries each pathname in the list
       until a file is found.

       Delivery via ~/.forward files is done with the privileges of the
       recipient.  Thus, ~/.forward like files must be readable by the
       recipient, and their parent directory needs to have "execute" permission
       for the recipient.

       The forward_path parameter is subject to interpolation of $user
       (recipient username), $home (recipient home directory), $shell (recipient
       shell), $recipient (complete recipient address), $extension (recipient
       address extension), $domain (recipient domain), $local (entire recipient
       address localpart) and $recipient_delimiter. The forms ${name?value} and
       ${name:value} expand conditionally to value when $name is (is not)
       defined.  Characters that may have special meaning to the shell or file
       system are replaced by underscores.  The list of acceptable characters is
       specified with the forward_expansion_filter configuration parameter.

       An alias or ~/.forward file may list any combination of external
       commands, destination file names, :include: directives, or mail
       addresses.  See aliases(5) for a precise description. Each line in a
       user's .forward file has the same syntax as the right-hand part of an
       alias.

       When an address is found in its own alias expansion, delivery is made to
       the user instead. When a user is listed in the user's own ~/.forward
       file, delivery is made to the user's mailbox instead.  An empty
       ~/.forward file means do not forward mail.

       In order to prevent the mail system from using up unreasonable amounts of
       memory, input records read from :include: or from ~/.forward files are
       broken up into chunks of length line_length_limit.

       While expanding aliases, ~/.forward files, and so on, the program
       attempts to avoid duplicate deliveries. The duplicate_filter_limit
       configuration parameter limits the number of remembered recipients.

MAIL FORWARDING
       For the sake of reliability, forwarded mail is re-submitted as a new
       message, so that each recipient has a separate on-file delivery status
       record.

       In order to stop mail forwarding loops early, the software adds an
       optional Delivered-To: header with the final envelope recipient address.
       If mail arrives for a recipient that is already listed in a Delivered-To:
       header, the message is bounced.

MAILBOX DELIVERY
       The default per-user mailbox is a file in the UNIX mail spool directory
       (/var/mail/user or /var/spool/mail/user); the location can be specified
       with the mail_spool_directory configuration parameter. Specify a name
       ending in / for qmail-compatible maildir delivery.

       Alternatively, the per-user mailbox can be a file in the user's home
       directory with a name specified via the home_mailbox configuration
       parameter. Specify a relative path name. Specify a name ending in / for
       qmail-compatible maildir delivery.

       Mailbox delivery can be delegated to an external command specified with
       the mailbox_command_maps and mailbox_command configuration parameters.
       The command executes with the privileges of the recipient user
       (exceptions: secondary groups are not enabled; in case of delivery as
       root, the command executes with the privileges of default_privs).

       Mailbox delivery can be delegated to alternative message transports
       specified in the master.cf file.  The mailbox_transport_maps and
       mailbox_transport configuration parameters specify an optional message
       transport that is to be used for all local recipients, regardless of
       whether they are found in the UNIX passwd database.  The
       fallback_transport_maps and fallback_transport parameters specify an
       optional message transport for recipients that are not found in the
       aliases(5) or UNIX passwd database.

       In the case of UNIX-style mailbox delivery, the local(8) daemon prepends
       a "From sender time_stamp" envelope header to each message, prepends an
       X-Original-To: header with the recipient address as given to Postfix,
       prepends an optional Delivered-To: header with the final envelope
       recipient address, prepends a Return-Path: header with the envelope
       sender address, prepends a > character to lines beginning with "From ",
       and appends an empty line.  The mailbox is locked for exclusive access
       while delivery is in progress. In case of problems, an attempt is made to
       truncate the mailbox to its original length.

       In the case of maildir delivery, the local daemon prepends an optional
       Delivered-To: header with the final envelope recipient address, prepends
       an X-Original-To: header with the recipient address as given to Postfix,
       and prepends a Return-Path: header with the envelope sender address.

EXTERNAL COMMAND DELIVERY
       The allow_mail_to_commands configuration parameter restricts delivery to
       external commands. The default setting (alias, forward) forbids command
       destinations in :include: files.

       Optionally, the process working directory is changed to the path
       specified with command_execution_directory (Postfix 2.2 and later).
       Failure to change directory causes mail to be deferred.

       The command_execution_directory parameter value is subject to
       interpolation of $user (recipient username), $home (recipient home
       directory), $shell (recipient shell), $recipient (complete recipient
       address), $extension (recipient address extension), $domain (recipient
       domain), $local (entire recipient address localpart) and
       $recipient_delimiter. The forms ${name?value} and ${name:value} expand
       conditionally to value when $name is (is not) defined.  Characters that
       may have special meaning to the shell or file system are replaced by
       underscores.  The list of acceptable characters is specified with the
       execution_directory_expansion_filter configuration parameter.

       The command is executed directly where possible. Assistance by the shell
       (/bin/sh on UNIX systems) is used only when the command contains shell
       magic characters, or when the command invokes a shell built-in command.

       A limited amount of command output (standard output and standard error)
       is captured for inclusion with non-delivery status reports.  A command is
       forcibly terminated if it does not complete within command_time_limit
       seconds.  Command exit status codes are expected to follow the
       conventions defined in <sysexits.h>.  Exit status 0 means normal
       successful completion.

       Postfix version 2.3 and later support RFC 3463-style enhanced status
       codes.  If a command terminates with a non-zero exit status, and the
       command output begins with an enhanced status code, this status code
       takes precedence over the non-zero exit status.

       A limited amount of message context is exported via environment
       variables. Characters that may have special meaning to the shell are
       replaced by underscores.  The list of acceptable characters is specified
       with the command_expansion_filter configuration parameter.

       SHELL  The recipient user's login shell.

       HOME   The recipient user's home directory.

       USER   The bare recipient name.

       EXTENSION
              The optional recipient address extension.

              The bare recipient name.

       LOCAL  The entire recipient address localpart (text to the left of the
              rightmost @ character).

       ORIGINAL_RECIPIENT
              The entire recipient address, before any address rewriting or
              aliasing (Postfix 2.5 and later).

       RECIPIENT
              The entire recipient address.

       SENDER The entire sender address.

       Additional remote client information is made available via the following
       environment variables:

       CLIENT_ADDRESS
              Remote client network address. Available as of Postfix 2.2.

       CLIENT_HELO
              Remote client EHLO command parameter. Available as of Postfix 2.2.

       CLIENT_HOSTNAME
              Remote client hostname. Available as of Postfix 2.2.

       CLIENT_PROTOCOL
              Remote client protocol. Available as of Postfix 2.2.

       SASL_METHOD
              SASL authentication method specified in the remote client AUTH
              command. Available as of Postfix 2.2.

       SASL_SENDER
              SASL sender address specified in the remote client MAIL FROM
              command. Available as of Postfix 2.2.

       SASL_USERNAME
              SASL username specified in the remote client AUTH command.
              Available as of Postfix 2.2.

       The PATH environment variable is always reset to a system-dependent
       default path, and environment variables whose names are blessed by the
       export_environment configuration parameter are exported unchanged.

       The current working directory is the mail queue directory.

       The local(8) daemon prepends a "From sender time_stamp" envelope header
       to each message, prepends an X-Original-To: header with the recipient
       address as given to Postfix, prepends an optional Delivered-To: header
       with the final recipient envelope address, prepends a Return-Path: header
       with the sender envelope address, and appends no empty line.

EXTERNAL FILE DELIVERY
       The delivery format depends on the destination filename syntax.  The
       default is to use UNIX-style mailbox format.  Specify a name ending in /
       for qmail-compatible maildir delivery.

       The allow_mail_to_files configuration parameter restricts delivery to
       external files. The default setting (alias, forward) forbids file
       destinations in :include: files.

       In the case of UNIX-style mailbox delivery, the local(8) daemon prepends
       a "From sender time_stamp" envelope header to each message, prepends an
       X-Original-To: header with the recipient address as given to Postfix,
       prepends an optional Delivered-To: header with the final recipient
       envelope address, prepends a > character to lines beginning with "From ",
       and appends an empty line.  The envelope sender address is available in
       the Return-Path: header.  When the destination is a regular file, it is
       locked for exclusive access while delivery is in progress. In case of
       problems, an attempt is made to truncate a regular file to its original
       length.

       In the case of maildir delivery, the local daemon prepends an optional
       Delivered-To: header with the final envelope recipient address, and
       prepends an X-Original-To: header with the recipient address as given to
       Postfix.  The envelope sender address is available in the Return-Path:
       header.

ADDRESS EXTENSION
       The optional recipient_delimiter configuration parameter specifies how to
       separate address extensions from local recipient names.

       For example, with "recipient_delimiter = +", mail for name+foo is
       delivered to the alias name+foo or to the alias name, to the destinations
       listed in ~name/.forward+foo or in ~name/.forward, to the mailbox owned
       by the user name, or it is sent back as undeliverable.

DELIVERY RIGHTS
       Deliveries to external files and external commands are made with the
       rights of the receiving user on whose behalf the delivery is made.  In
       the absence of a user context, the local(8) daemon uses the owner rights
       of the :include: file or alias database.  When those files are owned by
       the superuser, delivery is made with the rights specified with the
       default_privs configuration parameter.

STANDARDS
       RFC 822 (ARPA Internet Text Messages)
       RFC 3463 (Enhanced status codes)

DIAGNOSTICS
       Problems and transactions are logged to syslogd(8).  Corrupted message
       files are marked so that the queue manager can move them to the corrupt
       queue afterwards.

       Depending on the setting of the notify_classes parameter, the postmaster
       is notified of bounces and of other trouble.

SECURITY
       The local(8) delivery agent needs a dual personality 1) to access the
       private Postfix queue and IPC mechanisms, 2) to impersonate the recipient
       and deliver to recipient-specified files or commands. It is therefore
       security sensitive.

       The local(8) delivery agent disallows regular expression substitution of
       $1 etc. in alias_maps, because that would open a security hole.

       The local(8) delivery agent will silently ignore requests to use the
       proxymap(8) server within alias_maps. Instead it will open the table
       directly.  Before Postfix version 2.2, the local(8) delivery agent will
       terminate with a fatal error.

BUGS
       For security reasons, the message delivery status of external commands or
       of external files is never checkpointed to file. As a result, the program
       may occasionally deliver more than once to a command or external file.
       Better safe than sorry.

       Mutually-recursive aliases or ~/.forward files are not detected early.
       The resulting mail forwarding loop is broken by the use of the
       Delivered-To: message header.

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
       Changes to main.cf are picked up automatically, as local(8) processes run
       for only a limited amount of time. Use the command "postfix reload" to
       speed up a change.
