DIRS_CLEANER(8)              System Manager's Manual             DIRS_CLEANER(8)

NAME
     dirs_cleaner â€“ remove contents of directories

SYNOPSIS
     dirs_cleaner path ...

DESCRIPTION
     The dirs_cleaner utility recursively deletes the entire contents of each
     directory argument, while the directories themselves are not deleted. A
     cleaned directory may be re-created in the process of cleaning; if so, it
     gets a new inode number. Recursive traversals do not cross mount points.
     Each directory is identified directly or via a symbolic link.

     The dirs_cleaner utility exits with one of the following values:

     0       Each input directory was successfully cleaned.

     >0      An error occurred.
