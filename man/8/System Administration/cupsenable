NAME
       cupsdisable, cupsenable - stop/start printers and classes

SYNOPSIS
       cupsdisable [ -E ] [ -U username ] [ -c ] [ -h server[:port] ] [ -r
       reason ] [ --hold ] destination(s)
       cupsenable [ -E ] [ -U username ] [ -c ] [ -h server[:port] ] [ --release
       ] destination(s)

DESCRIPTION
       cupsenable starts the named printers or classes while cupsdisable stops
       the named printers or classes.

OPTIONS
       The following options may be used:

       -E   Forces encryption of the connection to the server.

       -U username
            Uses the specified username when connecting to the server.

       -c   Cancels all jobs on the named destination.

       -h server[:port]
            Uses the specified server and port.

       --hold
            Holds remaining jobs on the named printer.  Useful for allowing the
            current job to complete before performing maintenance.

       -r "reason"
            Sets the message associated with the stopped state.  If no reason is
            specified then the message is set to "Reason Unknown".

       --release
            Releases pending jobs for printing.  Use after running cupsdisable
            with the --hold option to resume printing.

CONFORMING TO
       Unlike the System V printing system, CUPS allows printer names to contain
       any printable character except SPACE, TAB, "/", or "#".  Also, printer
       and class names are not case-sensitive.

       The System V versions of these commands are disable and enable,
       respectively.  They have been renamed to avoid conflicts with the bash(1)
       build-in commands of the same names.

       The CUPS versions of disable and enable may ask the user for an access
       password depending on the printing system configuration.  This differs
       from the System V versions which require the root user to execute these
       commands.
