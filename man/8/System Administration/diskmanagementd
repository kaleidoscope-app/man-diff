NAME
     diskmanagementd â€“ DiskManagement.framework server

SYNOPSIS
     diskmanagementd

DESCRIPTION
     diskmanagementd is the back-end daemon to the DiskManagement framework.  It
     is launched on demand whenever there is at least one client of the
     DiskManagement framework in the system and exits automatically when there
     are no more such clients.

     diskmanagementd considers a client to have stopped using DiskManagement if
     it exited normally, exited abnormally (perhaps it crashed), or if it
     released all of its DiskManagement framework objects.

     There are no configuration options.  Users should not run this daemon
     manually.
