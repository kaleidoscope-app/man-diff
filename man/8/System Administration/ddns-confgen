DDNS-CONFGEN(8)                       BIND9                      DDNS-CONFGEN(8)



NAME
       ddns-confgen - ddns key generation tool

SYNOPSIS
       tsig-keygen [-a algorithm] [-h] [-r randomfile] [name]

       ddns-confgen [-a algorithm] [-h] [-k keyname] [-q] [-r randomfile]
                    [-s name | -z zone]

DESCRIPTION
       tsig-keygen and ddns-confgen are invocation methods for a utility that
       generates keys for use in TSIG signing. The resulting keys can be used,
       for example, to secure dynamic DNS updates to a zone or for the rndc
       command channel.

       When run as tsig-keygen, a domain name can be specified on the command
       line which will be used as the name of the generated key. If no name is
       specified, the default is tsig-key.

       When run as ddns-confgen, the generated key is accompanied by
       configuration text and instructions that can be used with nsupdate and
       named when setting up dynamic DNS, including an example update-policy
       statement. (This usage similar to the rndc-confgen command for setting up
       command channel security.)

       Note that named itself can configure a local DDNS key for use with
       nsupdate -l: it does this when a zone is configured with update-policy
       local;.  ddns-confgen is only needed when a more elaborate configuration
       is required: for instance, if nsupdate is to be used from a remote
       system.

OPTIONS
       -a algorithm
           Specifies the algorithm to use for the TSIG key. Available choices
           are: hmac-md5, hmac-sha1, hmac-sha224, hmac-sha256, hmac-sha384 and
           hmac-sha512. The default is hmac-sha256. Options are
           case-insensitive, and the "hmac-" prefix may be omitted.

       -h
           Prints a short summary of options and arguments.

       -k keyname
           Specifies the key name of the DDNS authentication key. The default is
           ddns-key when neither the -s nor -z option is specified; otherwise,
           the default is ddns-key as a separate label followed by the argument
           of the option, e.g., ddns-key.example.com. The key name must have the
           format of a valid domain name, consisting of letters, digits, hyphens
           and periods.

       -q
           (ddns-confgen only.) Quiet mode: Print only the key, with no
           explanatory text or usage examples; This is essentially identical to
           tsig-keygen.

       -r randomfile
           Specifies a source of random data for generating the authorization.
           If the operating system does not provide a /dev/random or equivalent
           device, the default source of randomness is keyboard input.
           randomdev specifies the name of a character device or file containing
           random data to be used instead of the default. The special value
           keyboard indicates that keyboard input should be used.

       -s name
           (ddns-confgen only.) Generate configuration example to allow dynamic
           updates of a single hostname. The example named.conf text shows how
           to set an update policy for the specified name using the "name"
           nametype. The default key name is ddns-key.name. Note that the "self"
           nametype cannot be used, since the name to be updated may differ from
           the key name. This option cannot be used with the -z option.

       -z zone
           (ddns-confgen only.) Generate configuration example to allow dynamic
           updates of a zone: The example named.conf text shows how to set an
           update policy for the specified zone using the "zonesub" nametype,
           allowing updates to all subdomain names within that zone. This option
           cannot be used with the -s option.
