SPRAY(8)                     System Manager's Manual                    SPRAY(8)

NAME
     spray â€“ send many packets to host

SYNOPSIS
     spray [-c count] [-d delay] [-l length] host ...

DESCRIPTION
     Spray sends multiple RPC packets to host and records how many of them were
     correctly received and how long it took.

     The options are as follows:

     -c count
             Send count packets.

     -d delay
             Pause delay microseconds between sending each packet.

     -l length
             Set the length of the packet that holds the RPC call message to
             length bytes.  Not all values of length are possible because RPC
             data is encoded using XDR.  Spray rounds up to the nearest possible
             value.

     Spray is intended for use in network testing, measurement, and management.
     This command can be very hard on a network and should be used with caution.
