NVRAM(8)                     System Manager's Manual                    NVRAM(8)

NAME
     nvram â€“ manipulate firmware NVRAM variables

SYNOPSIS
     nvram [-x] [-p] [-f filename] [-d name] [-c] [name [= value [...]]]

DESCRIPTION
     The nvram command allows manipulation of firmware NVRAM variables.  It can
     be used to get or set a variable.  It can also be used to print all of the
     variables or set a list of variables from a file.  Changes to NVRAM
     variables are only saved by clean restart or shutdown.

     In principle, name can be any string.  In practice, not all strings will be
     accepted.  Some variables require administrator privilege to get or set.

     The given value must match the data type required for name.  Binary data
     can be set using the %xx notation, where xx is the hex value of the byte.
     The type for new variables is always binary data.

OPTIONS
     -d name            Deletes the named firmware variable.

     -f filename        Set firmware variables from a text file.  The file must
                        be a list of "name value" statements.  The first space
                        on each line is taken to be the separator between "name"
                        and "value".  If the last character of a line is \, the
                        value extends to the next line.

     -x                 Use XML format for reading and writing variables.  This
                        option must be used before the -p or -f options, since
                        arguments are processed in order.

     -c                 Delete all of the firmware variables.

     -p                 Print all of the firmware variables.

EXAMPLES
             example% nvram boot-args="-s rd=*hd:10"

             Set the boot-args variable to "-s rd=*hd:10".  This would specify
             single user mode with the root device in hard drive partition 10.

                     example% nvram my-variable="String One%00String Two%00%00"

                     Create a new variable, my-variable, containing a list of
                     two C-strings that is terminated by a NUL.

                             example% nvram -d my-variable

                             Deletes the variable named my-variable.
