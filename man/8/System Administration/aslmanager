ASLMANAGER(8)                System Manager's Manual               ASLMANAGER(8)

NAME
     aslmanager – Apple System Log data life-cycle manager

SYNOPSIS
     aslmanager [-s store_dir] [-a [archive_dir]] [-ttl days] [-store_ttl days]
                [-module_ttl days] [-size max_size] [-asldb] [-module [name]]
                [-checkpoint] [-d [level]] [-dd [level]]

DESCRIPTION
     aslmanager manages rotated files and ASL data written by the syslogd
     server.  It is started automatically at various times by syslogd.  It may
     also be invoked from the command line by the superuser (root).  It manages
     the life-cycle of data in the ASL database, rotated log files, and ASL
     directory data stores.  Configuration information for aslmanager comes from
     the /etc/asl.conf configuration file, any ASL output module configuration
     files in the /etc/asl directory, and from command-line options that may be
     specified to override some settings found in the configuration files.  In
     normal operation, it first checks the ASL database in /var/log/asl, then it
     checks the files and directories specified by /etc/asl.conf and each ASL
     output module.

     If the -asldb flag is specified, then only the ASL database will be
     processed.

     If the -module flag is specified, then the ASL database will not be
     processed.  All ASL output modules, or a single module if name is
     specified, will be processed.

     If -checkpoint is specified, then aslmanager will signal syslogd to
     checkpoint files for all modules, or for a single named module, before
     processing.

     The -d flag causes aslmanager to print debug messages tracing it's actions
     as they are performed.  An integer value (1, 2, or 3) may follow the -d
     flag.  Higher values cause more fine-grained messages to be printed.  The
     default value is 1.  The -dd flag directs aslmanager to do a “dry run”.
     Debug messages are printed as with -d, but no actions are actually
     performed.  An optional debug level may follow the -dd flag.

   ASL DATABASE MANAGEMENT
     aslmanager scans the ASL database in /var/log/asl, or some other path
     specified by the setting of the “store_path” parameter in asl.conf, or by
     the path supplied following the -s flag.  Data files that are older than
     the time-to-live for the database are either archived or removed.  Files
     that contain messages with explicit expire times are removed or archived
     monthly after all their contents expire.  The default 7 day time-to-live
     value may be overridden by the setting of the “store_ttl” parameter in
     asl.conf or by supplying a value following the -store_ttl flag or the -ttl
     flag (which overrides the time-to-live for both the ASL database and for
     all ASL modules).  A time-to-live value of zero allows files to remain in
     the store with no time limit.

     A maximum size for the entire database is provided by the setting of the
     “max_store_size” parameter in asl.conf, or as a value following the -size
     flag.  This will cause aslmanager to archive (if enabled) and remove files
     to keep the database size below the specified limit.  The default value is
     150000000 bytes.  A value of zero means the size is unlimited.  An
     unlimited size specification should be used with great caution, since a
     runaway process could quickly fill all available disk space.  Files are
     removed in order starting from oldest to newest.  Files with the same date
     are removed in standard lexicographic sort order by file name.

     Files are either removed entirely or copied to an archive directory.  If
     the -a flag is specified with no argument, files are copied to the
     /var/log/asl.archive directory.  An alternate directory path may be
     specified following the -a flag.  The archive parameter setting in asl.conf
     enables or disables archiving.  The archive parameter requires a value of
     "1" to enable archiving, or a value of "0" to disable it.  An option
     archive directory path may follow the "0" or "1".

   ASL OUTPUT MODULE MANAGEMENT
     For each ASL output module, or a single module specified as an argument
     following -module, aslmanager first locates all checkpoint files produced
     by syslogd for that module.  aslmanager checks all ASL directory data
     stores and all rotated log files - those with a “rotate” option in the
     module's configuration rules.  Checkpoint files are renamed if necessary to
     conform to the naming style specified for the file by a “style” option in
     the module's configuration file.  aslmanager will compress the file if
     directed by a “compress” option, and it will move the file to a destination
     directory if a “dest” option is specified for the file.  Following this,
     aslmanager will delete expired files.  The time-to-live for files is 7 days
     by default, but may be specified using the “ttl” option for the file in the
     module's configuration rules.  If -module_ttl or -ttl are specified command
     line, then value specified as an argument is used as a time-to-live
     instead.  -module_ttl specifies time-to-live for module processing.  -ttl
     specifies time-to-live for both the ASL database and for modules.

     Finally, if the “all_max” option is specified for the output file,
     aslmanager checks the total size of all the rotated versions, and will
     delete them, (oldest first) to limit the total size as specified by
     “all_max”.  When processing ASL directory data stores, aslmanager will
     similarly delete data files after the expiry of their time-to-live, and
     will delete data files (oldest first) to limit the total size as specified
     by “all_max”.

HISTORY
     The aslmanager utility appeared in Mac OS X 10.6.  Support for log file and
     ASL directory life-cycle management was added in OS X 10.9.
