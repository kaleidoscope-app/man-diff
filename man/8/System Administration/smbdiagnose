NAME
     smbdiagnose – gather information to aid in diagnosing SMB file sharing
     issues

SYNOPSIS
     smbdiagnose -h
     smbdiagnose [-f path] [-s]

DESCRIPTION
     The smbdiagnose tool gathers system information and network traffic in
     order to assist Apple when investigating issues related to SMB file
     sharing.  A great deal of information is harvested, spanning system state,
     system configuration, and network traffic related to SMB file sharing.

   What smbdiagnose Collects:
           •   A network packet trace of SMB file sharing traffic that occurs
               during the time the tool is run.  This packet trace may include
               file names and file data.  It may also include the authentication
               exchange used to log into the SMB server.
           •   Enhanced debug logs for the SMB server process.
           •   If the -s option is specified, the default set of information
               collected by sysdiagnose(1).

   What smbdiagnose Doesn't Collect:
           •   No authentication credentials are harvested from the system

OPTIONS
     -h      Print full usage.
     -f path Write the diagnostic to the specified path.  The default is
             “~/Desktop”.
     -s      Collect sysdiagnose(1) information.  The default is not to collect
             sysdiagnose(1) information.

EXIT STATUS
     smbdiagnose exits with status 0 if there were no internal errors
     encountered during the diagnostic, or >0 when an error unrelated to
     external state occurs or unusable input is provided by the user.
