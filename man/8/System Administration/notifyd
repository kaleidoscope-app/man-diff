notifyd(8)                   System Manager's Manual                  notifyd(8)

NAME
     notifyd â€“ notification server

SYNOPSIS
     notifyd [-d] [-log_file path] [-shm_pages npages]

DESCRIPTION
     notifyd is the server for the Mac OS X notification system described in
     notify(3).  The server is started automatically by launchd during system
     startup.

     The -d option causes notifyd to log debugging messages to a log file.
     Messages are not logged to ASL to avoid potential deadlocks, since the ASL
     system makes use of the notify(3) system.

     The default log file is /var/log/notifyd.log.  An alternate log file path
     may be specified following the -log_file flag.

     The -shm_pages npages option sets the number of shared memory pages used
     for passive notification.  The default is one page.  If a value of zero is
     specified, shared memory is disabled and passive notifications are
     performed using IPC between the client and the server.
