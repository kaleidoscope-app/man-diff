OD_USER_HOMES(8)             System Manager's Manual            OD_USER_HOMES(8)

NAME
     od_user_homes â€“ executable map program for auto_home records synthesized
     from user records

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/libexec/od_user_homes [username]

DESCRIPTION
     od_user_homes is a program that takes a user name specified by username
     and, if there's a user record for that user in Open Directory, and that
     user record contains a HomeDirectory attribute, and the <path> portion of
     the HomeDirectory attribute is empty or just /, prints the URL from that
     attribute, and exits with an exit status of 0.  If there is no user record
     for that user, or the user record doesn't contain a HomeDirectory
     attribute, or the <path> portion is neither empty nor just /, or if an
     error occurs, nothing is printed, and od_user_homes exits with a user
     status of 1.  This is intended to be used as an executable map for
     auto_home.
