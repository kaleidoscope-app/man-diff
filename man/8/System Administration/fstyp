NAME
     fstyp â€“ identify a file system

SYNOPSIS
     fstyp device

DESCRIPTION
     The fstyp utility attempts to determine what sort of volume is present on
     the given device.  It operates by iterating over directories that are
     typically part of the path, searching for files matching the pattern
     fstyp_* and running them.  If it finds a match, it will print out the file
     system type name and exit with a return value of 1.  If it does not find a
     match, it will not print out anything, and the return value will be 0.
