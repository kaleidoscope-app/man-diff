KERNELMANAGERD(8)     KernelManagement daemon for managing kexts and collections



DESCRIPTION
       kernelmanagerd is the kernel extension server.  It runs as a standalone
       launchd(8) daemon to handle requests from the kernel, and from other
       user-space processes to load kernel extensions (kexts) if they are
       available in a loaded kext collection (see kmutil(8)).  If a kext is
       requested for load that is not yet available for loading, kernelmanagerd
       will build the kext into the auxiliary kext collection for use on the
       next reboot.  It is also responsible for launching driver extensions on
       the system.

       The KernelManagement utility kmutil(8) can interact with kernelmanagerd
       for requesting loads and unloads of kernel extensions, and for querying
       the daemon’s state.

       kernelmanagerd watches the /Library/Extensions directory for changes, to
       support installation and removal of kexts with installers.

PATHS
       /System/Library/KernelCollections
              is the standard system repository of kext collections.

       /System/Library/Extensions/
              is the standard system repository of kernel extensions.

       /Library/KernelCollections
              is the directory containing the auxiliary kext collection.

       /Library/Extensions/
              is a writable repository of kernel extensions suitable for use as
              an installer destination.

       /System/Library/Frameworks/KernelManagement.framework/Resources/com.apple.kernelmanagement.plist
              is a configuration file to modify the repositories and default
              paths used by kernelmanagerd and kmutil(8).

       /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.kernelmanagerd.plist
              is the path to the daemon’s launchd.plist(5).
