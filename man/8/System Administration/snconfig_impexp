SNCONFIG_IMPEXP(8)           System Manager's Manual          SNCONFIG_IMPEXP(8)



NAME
       snconfig_impexp - Xsan Configuration Import/Export Tool

SYNOPSIS
       snconfig_impexp action [options]

DESCRIPTION
       The snconfig_impexp command allows machine configuration of some of the
       various configuration files that Xsan uses.  Current values can be
       returned in JSON format via stdout.  A JSON object can be passed to stdin
       to cause the tool to update the configuration.  All this is done as
       directed by the actions described below.

       In almost all cases, a JSON object is written to stdout.  It will have
       keys describing the success or failure of the requested action.  The
       return_code key is zero if the action succeeded or one if the action
       failed.  If the action failed, an error key will be present describing
       the problem.  On a non-fatal error, a warnings key will be present.
       These keys will be ignored in a JSON object passed to snconfig_impexp.

       When snconfig_impexp modifies files, it first places backup-ups of the
       files into the
       /System/Library/Filesystems/acfs.fs/Contents/config_history directory.

ACTIONS
       -R     This action causes snconfig_impexp to read various Xsan
              configuration files and return their contents in a JSON object
              written to stdout.

       -W     This action takes a JSON object read from stdin, parses it, and
              writes its contents into the appropriate configuration files.  The
              format of the JSON object is the same as that returned by the -R
              action.  All top-level keys (other than the
              snconfig_impexp_version key), are optional.  If a top-level key is
              present, the key's values are written to the appropriate
              configuration files, replacing anything that was there.  If a top-
              level key is not present, then no changes are made to the
              configuration represent by the key.  After all configuration
              changes are made, the current state is returned exactly as if -R
              was specified.

OPTIONS
       -h     This option causes snconfig_impexp to print a friendly help
              message and exit.  This is the only output which is not in JSON
              format.

       -v     Format JSON output in a human-readable fashion.

EXIT VALUES
       snconfig_impexp will return 0 on success and non-zero on failure.

EXAMPLES
       A fully-populated output of snconfig_impexp looks like:

          # snconfig_impexp -vR
          {
              "snconfig_impexp_version": 1,
              "nss_coordinators": [
                  {
                      "ip": "10.11.12.13"
                  },
                  {
                      "ip": "10.11.12.14",
                      "cluster": "cluster12",
                      "addom": "my_addom"
                  },
                  {
                      "ip": "192.168.20.5",
                      "masklen": 29
                  }
              ],
              "cluster": {
                  "default_cluster": "cluster12",
                  "default_addom": "my_addom"
              },
              "fsms": [
                  {
                      "fsname": "snfs1"
                  },
                  {
                      "fsname": "snfs2"
                  },
                  {
                      "fsname": "snfs3",
                      "cluster": "cluster12",
                      "addom": "my_addom",
                      "priority": 100
                  }
              ],
              "return_code": 0
          }

       An unsuccessful run (because it was run as a non-privileged user) looks
       like:

          # snconfig_impexp -R | snconfig_impexp -vW
          {
              "snconfig_impexp_version": 1,
              "return_code": 1,
              "error": "nss_coordinators: error opening file '/usr/cvfs/config/fsnameservers-15229-1494358067': Permission denied"
          }
