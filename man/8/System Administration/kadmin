NAME
     kadmin – Kerberos administration utility

SYNOPSIS
     kadmin [-p string | --principal=string] [-K string | --keytab=string]
            [-c file | --config-file=file] [-k file | --key-file=file]
            [-r realm | --realm=realm] [-a host | --admin-server=host]
            [-s port number | --server-port=port number] [-l | --local]
            [-h | --help] [-v | --version] [command]

DESCRIPTION
     The kadmin program is used to make modifications to the Kerberos database,
     either remotely via the kadmind(8) daemon, or locally (with the -l option).

     Supported options:

     -p string, --principal=string
             principal to authenticate as

     -K string, --keytab=string
             keytab for authentication principal

     -c file, --config-file=file
             location of config file

     -k file, --key-file=file
             location of master key file

     -r realm, --realm=realm
             realm to use

     -a host, --admin-server=host
             server to contact

     -s port number, --server-port=port number
             port to use

     -l, --local
             local admin mode

     If no command is given on the command line, kadmin will prompt for commands
     to process. Some of the commands that take one or more principals as
     argument (delete, ext_keytab, get, modify, and passwd) will accept a glob
     style wildcard, and perform the operation on all matching principals.

     Commands include:

     add [-r | --random-key] [--random-password] [-p string | --password=string]
     [--key=string] [--max-ticket-life=lifetime] [--max-renewable-life=lifetime]
     [--attributes=attributes] [--expiration-time=time]
     [--pw-expiration-time=time] principal...

           Adds a new principal to the database. The options not passed on the
           command line will be promped for.

     add_enctype [-r | --random-key] principal enctypes...

           Adds a new encryption type to the principal, only random key are
           supported.

     delete principal...

           Removes a principal.

     del_enctype principal enctypes...

           Removes some enctypes from a principal; this can be useful if the
           service belonging to the principal is known to not handle certain
           enctypes.

     ext_keytab [-k string | --keytab=string] principal...

           Creates a keytab with the keys of the specified principals.  Requires
           get-keys rights.

     get [-l | --long] [-s | --short] [-t | --terse] [-o string |
     --column-info=string] principal...

           Lists the matching principals, short prints the result as a table,
           while long format produces a more verbose output. Which columns to
           print can be selected with the -o option. The argument is a comma
           separated list of column names optionally appended with an equal sign
           (‘=’) and a column header. Which columns are printed by default
           differ slightly between short and long output.

           The default terse output format is similar to -s -o principal=, just
           printing the names of matched principals.

           Possible column names include: principal, princ_expire_time,
           pw_expiration, last_pwd_change, max_life, max_rlife, mod_time,
           mod_name, attributes, kvno, mkvno, last_success, last_failed,
           fail_auth_count, policy, and keytypes.

     modify [-a attributes | --attributes=attributes]
     [--max-ticket-life=lifetime] [--max-renewable-life=lifetime]
     [--expiration-time=time] [--pw-expiration-time=time] [--kvno=number]
     principal...

           Modifies certain attributes of a principal. If run without command
           line options, you will be prompted. With command line options, it
           will only change the ones specified.

           Possible attributes are: new-princ, support-desmd5, pwchange-service,
           disallow-svr, requires-pw-change, requires-hw-auth,
           requires-pre-auth, disallow-all-tix, disallow-dup-skey,
           disallow-proxiable, disallow-renewable, disallow-tgt-based,
           disallow-forwardable, disallow-postdated

           Attributes may be negated with a "-", e.g.,

           kadmin -l modify -a -disallow-proxiable user

     passwd [--keepold] [-r | --random-key] [--random-password] [-p string |
     --password=string] [--key=string] principal...

           Changes the password of an existing principal.

     password-quality principal password

           Run the password quality check function locally.  You can run this on
           the host that is configured to run the kadmind process to verify that
           your configuration file is correct.  The verification is done
           locally, if kadmin is run in remote mode, no rpc call is done to the
           server.

     privileges

           Lists the operations you are allowed to perform. These include add,
           add_enctype, change-password, delete, del_enctype, get, get-keys,
           list, and modify.

     rename from to

           Renames a principal. This is normally transparent, but since keys are
           salted with the principal name, they will have a non-standard salt,
           and clients which are unable to cope with this will fail. Kerberos 4
           suffers from this.

     check [realm]

           Check database for strange configurations on important principals. If
           no realm is given, the default realm is used.

     When running in local mode, the following commands can also be used:

     dump [-d | --decrypt] [dump-file]

           Writes the database in “human readable” form to the specified file,
           or standard out. If the database is encrypted, the dump will also
           have encrypted keys, unless --decrypt is used.

     init [--realm-max-ticket-life=string] [--realm-max-renewable-life=string]
     realm

           Initializes the Kerberos database with entries for a new realm. It's
           possible to have more than one realm served by one server.

     load file

           Reads a previously dumped database, and re-creates that database from
           scratch.

     merge file

           Similar to load but just modifies the database with the entries in
           the dump file.

     stash [-e enctype | --enctype=enctype] [-k keyfile | --key-file=keyfile]
     [--convert-file] [--master-key-fd=fd] [--random-password]
     [--no-print-password]

           Writes the Kerberos master key to a file used by the KDC.
