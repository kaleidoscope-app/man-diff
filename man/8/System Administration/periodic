PERIODIC(8)                  System Manager's Manual                 PERIODIC(8)

NAME
     periodic – run periodic system functions

SYNOPSIS
     periodic directory ...

DESCRIPTION
     The periodic utility is intended to be called by launchd(8) to execute
     shell scripts located in the specified directory.

     One or more of the following arguments must be specified:

     daily        Perform the standard daily periodic executable run.  This
                  usually occurs early in the morning (local time).

     weekly       Perform the standard weekly periodic executable run.  This
                  usually occurs very early on Saturday mornings.

     monthly      Perform the standard monthly periodic executable run.  This
                  usually occurs on the first day of the month.

     path         An arbitrary directory containing a set of executables to be
                  run.

     If an argument is an absolute directory name it is used as is, otherwise it
     is searched for under /etc/periodic and any other directories specified by
     the local_periodic setting in periodic.conf(5) (see below).

     The periodic utility will run each executable file in the directory or
     directories specified.  If a file does not have the executable bit set, it
     is silently ignored.

     Each script is required to exit with one of the following values:

     0     The script has produced nothing notable in its output.  The
           ⟨basedir⟩_show_success variable controls the masking of this output.

     1     The script has produced some notable information in its output.  The
           ⟨basedir⟩_show_info variable controls the masking of this output.

     2     The script has produced some warnings due to invalid configuration
           settings.  The ⟨basedir⟩_show_badconfig variable controls the masking
           of this output.

     >2    The script has produced output that must not be masked.

     If the relevant variable (where ⟨basedir⟩ is the base directory in which
     the script resides) is set to “NO” in periodic.conf, periodic will mask the
     script output.  If the variable is not set to either “YES” or “NO”, it will
     be given a default value as described in periodic.conf(5).

     All remaining script output is delivered based on the value of the
     ⟨basedir⟩_output setting.

     If this is set to a path name (beginning with a ‘/’ character), output is
     simply logged to that file.  newsyslog(8) knows about the files
     /var/log/daily.log, /var/log/weekly.log and /var/log/monthly.log, and if
     they exist, it will rotate them at the appropriate times.  These are
     therefore good values if you wish to log periodic output.

     If the ⟨basedir⟩_output value does not begin with a ‘/’ and is not empty,
     it is assumed to contain a list of email addresses, and the output is
     mailed to them.  If ⟨basedir⟩_show_empty_output is set to “NO”, then no
     mail will be sent if the output was empty.

     If ⟨basedir⟩_output is not set or is empty, output is sent to standard
     output.

ENVIRONMENT
     The periodic utility sets the PATH environment to include all standard
     system directories, but no additional directories, such as /usr/local/bin.
     If executables are added which depend upon other path components, each
     executable must be responsible for configuring its own appropriate
     environment.

FILES
     /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.periodic-*.plist
                                      the periodic utility is typically called
                                      via these launchd(8) jobs

     /etc/periodic                    the top level directory containing daily,
                                      weekly, and monthly subdirectories which
                                      contain standard system periodic
                                      executables

     /etc/defaults/periodic.conf      the periodic.conf system registry contains
                                      variables that control the behaviour of
                                      periodic and the standard daily, weekly,
                                      and monthly scripts

     /etc/periodic.conf               this file contains local overrides for the
                                      default periodic configuration

EXIT STATUS
     Exit status is 0 on success and 1 if the command fails.

EXAMPLES
     The /etc/defaults/periodic.conf system registry will typically have a
     local_periodic variable reading:

           local_periodic="/usr/local/etc/periodic"

     To log periodic output instead of receiving it as email, add the following
     lines to /etc/periodic.conf:

           daily_output=/var/log/daily.log
           weekly_output=/var/log/weekly.log
           monthly_output=/var/log/monthly.log

     To only see important information from daily periodic jobs, add the
     following lines to /etc/periodic.conf:

           daily_show_success=NO
           daily_show_info=NO
           daily_show_badconfig=NO

DIAGNOSTICS
     The command may fail for one of the following reasons:

     usage: periodic <directory of files to execute>  No directory path argument
     was passed to periodic to specify where the script fragments reside.

     <directory> not found  Self explanatory.

BUGS
     Since one specifies information about a directory using shell variables
     containing the string, ⟨basedir⟩, ⟨basedir⟩ must only contain characters
     that are valid within a sh(1) variable name, alphanumerics and underscores,
     and the first character may not be numeric.
