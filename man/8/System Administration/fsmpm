NAME
       fsmpm - Xsan File System Port Mapper daemon

SYNOPSIS
       fsmpm [-nc] [host-ip [debug [sync [diskscan [extHA]]]]]

DESCRIPTION
       The FSM Portmapper is a server daemon residing on each Xsan File System
       client and server. It registers an RPC identifier to the system's portmap
       daemon. The fsmpm publishes a well known port where the Xsan File System
       Manager (FSM) daemons can register their volume name and port access
       number. All clients then talk to their local FSS port mapper to discover
       access information for their associated service.  This process runs in
       the background and is started at boot time. It is enabled or disabled
       (along with the volume) via chkconfig(8) or init.d using the acfs key
       word.

OPTIONS
       Apple Internal Use Only - contact support before adding or modifying
       command line arguments to fsmpm.  Changes from the defaults may result in
       intermittent or total failure of Xsan.  Options may change abruptly
       between releases.

       -n     Don't send a SIGQUIT signal to fsm processes that appear to be
              hung; normally if an fsm process doesn't exit within 60 seconds
              after breaking the connection to the fsmpm, the fsmpm sends a
              SIGQUIT signal to the fsm.

       -c     Assume the client kernel module has not been loaded and skip any
              operations related to it.

       host-ip
              The IP address used to access this host.  The default is to try to
              resolve the system's hostname to an address. If set to 127.1, no
              nameserver will be used and no heartbeats will be sent.  (default:
              no hostname)

       debug  Bitmask specifying which debug messages to print. (default: 0)

       sync   The name of a file whose creation is used to detect when the fsmpm
              has successfully started.  (default: no file)

       diskscan
              How often (in seconds) to rescan for changed paths.  0 disables
              the disk scan.  (default: 0)

       extHA  External HA mode prevents the fsmpm from automatically starting
              FSMs in the fsmlist, as well as disabling calls for elections.  1
              enables external HA mode; 0 disables it.  (default: 0)

       NOTE: Defaults specified with '--'.

FSNAMESERVERS
       The fsmpm reads the file /Library/Preferences/Xsan/fsnameservers to
       establish file system name servers for the Xsan file system services.
       This list is used to coordinate the whereabouts of Xsan file system
       servers.

       A name server list must be established on each client that has Xsan
       installed so that all clients can discover the location of the Xsan FSM
       servers. It is important that this list is consistent across the SAN.
       Inconsistent fsnameservers configuration may result in the inability for
       some clients to find a file system service. See fsnameservers(4) for
       specifics of the file format.

FSMLIST
       The fsmpm is responsible for launching the FSM daemon(s). If
       /Library/Preferences/Xsan/fsmlist exists then the fsmpm reads from the
       list file and starts the FSM daemons that are specified. If no
       /Library/Preferences/Xsan/fsmlist file exists then the fsmpm tries to
       launch the FSM daemon for the volume named default. See fsmlist(4) for
       specifics of the file format.

Unique Identifier (UUID)
       The fsmpm creates or accesses the /Library/Preferences/Xsan/snfs_uuid
       file. This contains a Xsan unique identifier (UUID) for this host.  The
       file should not initially exist on a host that deploys StorNext.  If
       configuration information is copied from one host to another, this file
       should either not be copied or be deleted on the new host.

ENVIRONMENT
       These variables are for use by Apple support personnel only.

       FSMPM_MAX_LOGFILES
          Controls the number of old nssdbg.out log files that will be saved by
          fsmpm when the current log file reaches its maximum size.  The default
          is 4.

       FSMPM_MAX_LOGSIZE
          Controls the maximum size that the nssdbg.out file can grow to before
          a new log file will be started.  The value is a number followed by an
          optional suffix (K for Kilobytes, M for Megabytes, G for Gigabytes),
          or the string unlimited, indicating that the file can grow without
          bound.  The default is 1M and the minimum is 64K.

       FSMPM_ACTIVE_FSM_CLIENT_TIMEOUT
          Adjusts the logic that determines when an FSM should be considered
          lost and an election started to determine a new active FSM. The value
          is specified in seconds.

DEBUG
       Debugging traces are written to the file
       /Library/Logs/Xsan/debug/nssdbg.out.  The amount of debug information is
       controlled by the /Library/Logs/Xsan/debug/verbose file.  This file
       contains the list of debug traces to turn on.  If the file does not
       exist, none of the optional debug traces are enabled.  Blank lines and
       comments that begin with a # are ignored.  Everything else is treated as
       a name for what debug traces to turn on.  Names are separated by
       whitespace or commas, and may be listed on multiple lines.  Unknown names
       are silently ignored.

       general
              Print general trace information.  This include information about
              acquiring port numbers for coordinators, listing FSMs, mapping IDs
              hostnames, disk requests, portmap inquiries, device event
              handlers, and other events.

       input  Print a trace for every NSS packet received.

       output Print a trace for every NSS packet sent.

       mbr    Print traces about Heartbeat Membership changes.

       vote   Print traces about FSM elections.

       ldap_cred
              Print traces for LDAP credential processing.

       proxy  Print traces about proxy processing (Distributed LAN client).

       cctl   Print traces about the cluster-wide central control (nss_cctl).

       hamon_reset
              Print traces for HAMON resets.

       helper Print traces about starting and stopping helper processes.

       ahb    Print traces about NSS accelerated heartbeats.

       protobuf
              Print details of all NSS2 packets as they are created and parsed.

       all    Enable all debug tracing

       Numeric values are also recognized as specific debug bits to set.  This
       is mainly for backwards compatibility.  A value of -1 or 0xffffffff is
       the same as specifying all.

       If there are no recognized names or numeric values in the verbose file,
       e.g. if it exists but is empty, then the mbr and vote traces will be
       enabled.

       An example of a verbose file:

          # Comments are ignored
          vote, mbr # Turn on the vote and membership traces
             general
          foo bar # Unknown items are silently ignored

          # These are very noisy
          #input
          #output

          0x1000 # turn on an undefined bit

FILES
       /Library/Preferences/Xsan/fsnameservers
       /Library/Preferences/Xsan/fsforeignservers
       /Library/Preferences/Xsan/fsmlist
       /Library/Preferences/Xsan/nss_cctl*.xml
       /Library/Logs/Xsan/debug/nssdbg.out
       /Library/Logs/Xsan/debug/snfs_uuid
       /Library/Logs/Xsan/debug/verbose

NOTES
       When a SIGHUP signal is received, the configuration files will be re-
       read.  This allows, for example, the FSM list to be modified, or
       debugging levels to be changed.
