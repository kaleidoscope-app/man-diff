SNFSNAMESCANNER(8)           System Manager's Manual          SNFSNAMESCANNER(8)



NAME
       SNFSNAMESCANNER - Scan for unusual names in a Xsan Volume

SYNOPSIS
       /System/Library/Filesystems/acfs.fs/Contents/lib/snfsnamescanner -ipu
              [-L 1] pathname |-h

DESCRIPTION
       snfsnamescanner scans the Xsan file system starting at the specified
       pathname for file and directory names that are:

       — Illegal Windows names.  Names that do not conform to the Windows naming
         convention.

       — Names with Unicode Private User Area (PUA) code points.  Illegal
         Windows names that are created by Mac and Linux SMB clients.

       — Names with invalid UTF-8 values.  Names created by StorNext Linux and
         Mac clients using invalid UTF-8 hex sequences.

       If snfsnamescanner finds a name with one of the specified problems, it
       creates a script which can be used to change the name of the file.

       pathname is the path to the root directory of a mount Xsan file system.

       Snfsnamescanner can only be run on a Linux system.  You may need to
       become user root to access all the files and directories in the file
       system.  Run snfsnamescanner on the active MDC for the fastest scan
       times.

OPTIONS
       -i     Scan the specified file system for illegal Windows file names.
              The file names with illegal file names are placed in the file
              illegalFileNames.sh.  This file can be used for changing the file
              name to a legal Windows file name.

       -p     Scan the specified file system for file names with PUA code points
              in the name.  The file names with PUA code points are put in the
              file puaFileNames.sh.  This file can be used for changing the file
              name to an equivalent name with ASCII characters.

       -u     Scan the specified file system for file names with invalid UTF-8
              values in the name.  The file names with invalid UTF-8 values are
              put in the file utf8FileNames.sh.

       -L 1   Convert Latin-1 characters to UTF-8.  Use in conjunction with the
              -u option.  Treat any invalid UTF-8 byte sequence as a Latin-1
              character.  Translate each Latin-1 character to a valid UTF-8
              sequence.  Use this option only if you are sure the character
              encoding is Latin-1.

       -h     Display help

       You can specify one or more of the -i, -p or -u options at the same time.
       Specifying more than one option is more efficient than running
       snfsnamescanner multiple times.

Examples:
       To scan for illegal Windows file names:

          snfsnamescanner -i /stornext/snfs1

       The list of illegal file names is written to ./illegalFileNames.sh.  Each
       line in illlegalFileNames.sh will have identical source and target file
       names.  You will have to decide on how to change the target file name to
       a legal Windows file name.

       To scan for PUA code points in file system names:

          snfsnamescanner -p /stornext/snfs1

       The list of file names with PUA code points is written to
       ./puaFileNames.sh.  This script can be used without modification.  Run
       this script on the same system it was created since it uses the mount
       point to the file system.  This script will replace each PUA code point
       in a file or directory name with the equivalent PUA code point ASCII
       character.

       To scan for file names with invalid UTF-8 values:

          snfsnamescanner -u /stornext/snfs1

       The list of file names with invalid UTF-8 values is written to
       ./utf8FileNames.sh.  If the -L option is not used, each line in
       utf8FileNames.sh will have identical source and target file names.  You
       will have to decide on how to change the invalid UTF-8 values to valid
       UTF-8 values.

       The target names in the illlegalFileNames.sh file, and possibly the
       utf8FileNames.sh file, will need to be changed before running the script.
       There are many ways to do this.  Here is an example on how to use the
       Linux sed(1) command to change the target file names in the
       illlegalFileNames.sh file.

       To change the target file names in the ./illegalFileNames.sh file, run
       the following command.

              sed -i -f sedscript ./illegalFileNames.sh

       Where the contents of the sedscript should looks something like this:

              s-\(\t'/stornext/snfs1/.*\)<-\1#-
              s-\(\t'/stornext/snfs1/.*\)>-\1@-
              s-\(\t'/stornext/snfs1/.*\):-\1!-
              s-\(\t'/stornext/snfs1/.*\)"-\1%-
              s-\(\t'/stornext/snfs1/.*\)|-\1+-
              s-\(\t'/stornext/snfs1/.*\)?-\1~-
              s-\(\t'/stornext/snfs1/.*\)\*-\1A-
              s-\(\t'/stornext/snfs1/.*\) '$-\1_'-
              s-\(\t'/stornext/snfs1/.*\)\.'$-\1p'-

       Change the string "/stornext/snfs1" to match the mount point in the
       ./illegalFileNames.sh file.  The substitution characters are just an
       example.  You can change the sed substitution characters to any set of
       characters you like, although it would be best if each substitution is
       unique.  You may need to run this sed script multiple times.  Each pass
       will only change a single occurance of the character on a line.  You may
       want to grep the ./illegalFileNames.sh file to see which Windows reserved
       characters are present in the file and modify the sed script accordingly.
