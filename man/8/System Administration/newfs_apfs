DESCRIPTION
     The newfs_apfs command creates a new APFS container on the device and/or
     adds a new APFS volume to a container.

     The first, more traditional, form of newfs_apfs formats the given special
     as a container with a single volume inside it.  The second form creates a
     container only, with no volumes.  The third form is used to non-
     destructively add additional volumes inside an existing container.  The
     fourth form reformats an existing volume by effectively deleting and re-
     creating it; in this usage (only) special indicates a volume inside the
     container.

     The special parameter should be the path to a disk device node, such as
     /dev/disk1s2, although can be specified as simply disk1s2.

     The options are as follows:

     -b block-size      The block size of the container.  All volumes within
                        this container will use this block size.  The default is
                        4096 bytes.

     -o options         Additional volume formatting options.  Currently only:
                          conformance    The volume will be UNIX conformant.

     -i                 Creates a case-insensitive volume.  This is the default
                        on macOS.

     -e                 Creates a case-sensitive volume.

     -U uid             The UID of the root volume.  Defaults to current UID.

     -G uid             The GID of the root volume.  Defaults to current GID.

     -q volume-quota    Places a quota, or upper limit, on the size of the
                        volume.  If specified then no more than this much space
                        will be used for its content, even if there is
                        additional free space in the container; however it is
                        not guaranteed that the entire quota will always be
                        available.  By default a volume has no assigned quota.

     -r volume-reserve  Reserves an amount of space for this volume.  If
                        specified it is guaranteed that at least this much space
                        will be available for its content; the volume may also
                        grow beyond this size (up to its quota limit, if any) if
                        additional free space in the container.  By default a
                        volume has no assigned reserve.

     -s volume-size     The fixed size of the volume.  If specified then the
                        volume is guaranteed that exactly this much space will
                        be available for its content.  Setting -s is equivalant
                        to setting both -q and -r to that same value.  If not
                        specified then the available space is dynamic and
                        determined by the usage of other volumes within the same
                        container (space-sharing).

     -v volume-name     The name of the volume.  The default is "untitled".

     -A                 Add a volume to an existing container.  There is a limit
                        to the number of volumes that may reside inside a
                        container.

     -C                 Create a container only, with no volume.  newfs_apfs -A
                        may be used later to format volumes inside that
                        container.

     -E                 Enable volume encryption.  The volume metadata is also
                        encrypted.

     -S password        Key used for volume encryption.  If the password option
                        is omitted for an encrypted volume, a prompt will
                        request a password for the new volume.  This option is
                        unsecure because other non-privileged users (on multi-
                        user systems) have means to see command-line arguments,
                        including passwords, and is therefore not recommended
                        for use (use the prompt instead).

     -F special         Format as a Fusion device (with the secondary device
                        specified here).

     -R role            Set the OS "role" of the volume within the container.
                        The role may be one of the following characters:
                          b   Preboot - will contain information used to help
                              boot System volumes
                          r   Recovery - will contain the RecoveryOS
                          v   VM - will contain swapfiles and hibernate image

EXIT STATUS
     The newfs_apfs utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     The following formats a new container and a volume named "Macintosh" on the
     /dev/disk1s2 device:
           newfs_apfs -v Macintosh disk1s2

     And then this adds another volume, named "Data" with a fixed size of 100
     GB, to that container:
           newfs_apfs -v Data -s 100g -A disk1s2
