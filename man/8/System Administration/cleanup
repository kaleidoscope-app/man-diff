CLEANUP(8)                   System Manager's Manual                  CLEANUP(8)




NAME
       cleanup - canonicalize and enqueue Postfix message

SYNOPSIS
       cleanup [generic Postfix daemon options]

DESCRIPTION
       The cleanup(8) daemon processes inbound mail, inserts it into the
       incoming mail queue, and informs the queue manager of its arrival.

       The cleanup(8) daemon always performs the following transformations:

       •      Insert missing message headers: (Resent-) From:, To:, Message-Id:,
              and Date:.

       •      Transform envelope and header addresses to the standard
              user@fully-qualified-domain form that is expected by other Postfix
              programs.  This task is delegated to the trivial-rewrite(8)
              daemon.

       •      Eliminate duplicate envelope recipient addresses.

       •      Remove message headers: Bcc, Content-Length, Resent-Bcc,
              Return-Path.

       The following address transformations are optional:

       •      Optionally, rewrite all envelope and header addresses according to
              the mappings specified in the canonical(5) lookup tables.

       •      Optionally, masquerade envelope sender addresses and message
              header addresses (i.e. strip host or domain information below all
              domains listed in the masquerade_domains parameter, except for
              user names listed in masquerade_exceptions).  By default, address
              masquerading does not affect envelope recipients.

       •      Optionally, expand envelope recipients according to information
              found in the virtual(5) lookup tables.

       The cleanup(8) daemon performs sanity checks on the content of each
       message. When it finds a problem, by default it returns a diagnostic
       status to the client, and leaves it up to the client to deal with the
       problem. Alternatively, the client can request the cleanup(8) daemon to
       bounce the message back to the sender in case of trouble.

STANDARDS
       RFC 822 (ARPA Internet Text Messages)
       RFC 2045 (MIME: Format of Internet Message Bodies)
       RFC 2046 (MIME: Media Types)
       RFC 2822 (Internet Message Format)
       RFC 3463 (Enhanced Status Codes)
       RFC 3464 (Delivery status notifications)
       RFC 5322 (Internet Message Format)

DIAGNOSTICS
       Problems and transactions are logged to syslogd(8).

BUGS
       Table-driven rewriting rules make it hard to express if then else and
       other logical relationships.

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
       Changes to main.cf are picked up automatically, as cleanup(8) processes
       run for only a limited amount of time. Use the command "postfix reload"
       to speed up a change.

       The text below provides only a parameter summary. See postconf(5) for
       more details including examples.

COMPATIBILITY CONTROLS

              sender address (this feature is removed with Postfix version 2.2,
              is turned off by default with Postfix version 2.1, and is always
              turned on with older Postfix versions).

BEFORE QUEUE MILTER CONTROLS
       As of version 2.3, Postfix supports the Sendmail version 8 Milter (mail
       filter) protocol. When mail is not received via the smtpd(8) server, the
