MOUNTD(8)                    System Manager's Manual                   MOUNTD(8)

NAME
     mountd â€“ service remote NFS mount requests

SYNOPSIS
     Obsolete.  See nfsd(8).

DESCRIPTION
     The mountd daemon was formerly the server for NFS mount requests from NFS
     clients.  This functionality has been moved into the NFS server daemon
     nfsd(8).

     Please refer to nfsd(8) for NFS server documenation.

     The following is a list of former mountd options that are now available as
     nfsd(8) options:

           mountd option        nfsd option            Description
           -n                   -N                     allow non-root mounts
           -r                   -R                     allow regular file mounts
           exportsfile          -F exportsfile         alternate exports file

     However, such configuration options are normally specified via nfs.conf(5).

     When the NFS server is started, it loads the export host addresses and
     options into the kernel using the nfssvc(2) system call.  After changing
     the list of exports (either directly or indirectly via a change in netgroup
     membership), the administrator should send a hangup signal to the nfsd
     daemon to get it to reload the export information:

           kill -s HUP `cat /var/run/nfsd.pid`

     For backwards compatibility, the following should also work:

           kill -s HUP `cat /var/run/mountd.pid`

     Any errors encountered while processing the export entries will be logged
     via syslog(3).

FILES
     /etc/exports         the list of exported filesystems
     /var/run/mountd.pid  the pid of the currently running mountd
     /var/run/mountdtab   the current list of outstanding mounts served
     /var/run/mountdexptab
                          information about exported file systems and
                          directories (UUIDs, handles, ...)

SEE ALSO
     nfsd(8), exports(5), nfs.conf(5), nfsstat(1), portmap(8), showmount(8)

HISTORY
     The mountd utility first appeared in 4.4BSD.  It's functionality was merged
     into nfsd(8) in Darwin 9.
