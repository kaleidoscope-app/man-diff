NAME
     localemanager â€“ Configure OpenDirectory Server Locales

SYNOPSIS
     localemanager operation [-l localename] [-subnet 1.2.3.4/5]
                   [-server servername] [-i IP address]

DESCRIPTION
     localemanager creates, destroys, and edits OpenDirectory Server Locale
     information.  Locales are collections of OpenDirectory servers to assist
     clients in locating the nearest OpenDirectory Server.

     To use OpenDirectory Server Locales, simply create a locale on an OD server
     with the createLocale operation.  Then add servers and subnets to the
     locale.  All localemanager operations are performed on the local
     OpenDirectory node.

     The first time a locale is created, a DefaultLocale will automatically be
     created as well.  The DefaultLocale will be used for any clients that don't
     match a subnet in any other locale.

     Before a locale can be configured, the server must already be an
     OpenDirectory server.

     Locales can be defined on each of the OD servers or on a single OD server
     in the group of OD master/replicas.  For the latter, the locale information
     will get replicated to all of the other servers but locales will need to be
     "enabled" on the other servers by running the command localemanager
     enableLocales.

     Commands:

     help    Displays the commands and options.

     createLocale
             Creates a new locale on the local OD server.  This command requires
             the -l option.

     deleteLocale
             Deletes a locale from the local OD server.  This command requires
             the -l option.

     showLocale
             Displays the current locale(s).  The -l option can be used to
             display a specific locale.  If -l is not specified, all locales are
             displayed.

     enableLocales
             Enables the use of locales on an OD server.  This command is
             automatically run the first time any localemanager command is run
             on an OD server.  Therefore this command only needs to be run if no
             other localemanager commands have been (or will be) run on this
             server.

     addSubnet
             Adds a new subnet to the specified locale.  This command requires
             the -l -subnet options.

     removeSubnet
             Removes a subnet from the specified locale.  This command requires
             -l -subnet options.

     addServer
             Adds a server to the specified locale. This command requires the -l
             -server options.  If the -i option is specified, that IP address
             will be used by locale clients.  This may be useful for multi-homed
             servers to restrict locale clients to a specific network interface.
             If the -i option is not specified the IP address(es) will be looked
             up.

     removeServer
             Removes a server from the specified locale.  This command requires
             -l -server options.  If the -i option is specified, only that IP
             address will be removed from the locale.  If the -i option is no
             specified, all of the server's IP addresses will be removed from
             the locale.

     Options:

     -l locale
             Locale name.

     -subnet 192.168.0.0/16
             Subnet specified in CIDR notation.

     -server server.example.com
             Server fully-qualified domain name.

     -i 192.168.1.1
             Use this IP address for the server.  Typically used to limit locale
             clients to a specific interface on a multi-homed server.
