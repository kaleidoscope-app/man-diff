MOUNT_FTP(8)                 System Manager's Manual                MOUNT_FTP(8)

NAME
     mount_ftp â€“ mount a FTP filesystem

SYNOPSIS
     mount_ftp [-i] [-o options] ftp://host[:port][/path] node

DESCRIPTION
     The mount_ftp command mounts a FTP-enabled server directory at
     ftp://host[:port][/path] at the mount point indicated by node.

     If the -i option is not used, all the required information to establish a
     login to the remote server must be available in the ftp URL, including
     username & password if needed.

     The user ID for all files and folders is set to the user's real user ID.
     The group ID for all files and directories is set to unknown, and the
     permissions default to read and execute for user, group and other.

     The options are:

     -i      Interactive mode, you are prompted for the username and password if
             you did not supply one in the url.

     -o      Options passed to mount(2) are specified with the -o option
             followed by a comma separated string of options. See the mount(8)
             man page for possible options and their meanings. The rdonly option
             will be set even if it was not specified because mount_ftp does not
             allow files to be opened with write access on servers.

     ftp://host[:port][/path]
             The FTP-enabled server directory to mount as a volume. If port is
             not specified, then port 21 is used. If path is not specified, then
             the path "/" is used.

     node    Path to mount point.

EXAMPLES
     The following example illustrates how to mount the FTP-enabled server
     directory ftp.apple.com/ at the mount point /Volumes/mntpnt/

           mount_ftp ftp://ftp.apple.com/ /Volumes/mntpnt/

RETURN VALUES
     0                  mount_ftp successfully mounted the server directory.

     [ENOENT]           The server directory could not be mounted by mount_ftp
                        because the node path is invalid.

     [ENODEV]           The server directory could not be mounted by mount_ftp
                        because it is not FTP-enabled or because it does not
                        exist, or because node does not have proper access.

     [ECANCELED]        The server directory could not be mounted by mount_ftp
                        because the user did not provide proper authentication
                        credentials.
