CVFSID(8)                    System Manager's Manual                   CVFSID(8)



NAME
       cvfsid - Display SNFS System Identifier

SYNOPSIS
       /System/Library/Filesystems/acfs.fs/Contents/bin/cvfsid [-?Ghnl]

DESCRIPTION
       cvfsid provides a mechanism for displaying the SNFS identifier for the
       executing system.  For customers using client-based licensing, SNFS
       identifiers are used to generate individual client licenses.  This
       identifier string is submitted to Apple Technical Support for license
       authorization keys.  See the installation instructions for additional
       information on SNFS licensing.

OPTIONS
       -h, -? Display help

       -G     Gather mode.  NOTE: Not intended for general use.  Only use when
              recommended by Apple Support.

       -l     List the local host's Authorizing IDs, IP addresses, and MACs.
              (Linux only.)

       -n     Display the network interface information in a compact, machine
              readable form.  (Linux only.)

       When executed without options, cvfsid prints the information required to
       generate a license for the host on which it is executed.  Simply execute
       the program on each participating system, and either Email or Fax the
       identifiers to Apple Technical Support for authorization keys.

       After the license keys are received cut-and-paste them into the file
       /Library/Preferences/Xsan/license.dat on the system that runs the CVFS
       File System Manager.
