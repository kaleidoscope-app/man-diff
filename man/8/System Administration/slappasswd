SLAPPASSWD(8C)                                                    SLAPPASSWD(8C)



NAME
       slappasswd - OpenLDAP password utility

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/slappasswd [-v] [-u] [-g|-s secret|-T file] [-h_hash]
       [-c_salt-format] [-n]

DESCRIPTION
       Slappasswd is used to generate an userPassword value suitable for use
       with ldapmodify(1), slapd.conf(5) rootpw configuration directive or the
       slapd-config(5) olcRootPW configuration directive.

OPTIONS
       -v     enable verbose mode.

       -u     Generate RFC 2307 userPassword values (the default).  Future
              versions of this program may generate alternative syntaxes by
              default.  This option is provided for forward compatibility.

       -s_secret
              The secret to hash.  If this, -g and -T are absent, the user will
              be prompted for the secret to hash.  -s, -g and -T are mutually
              exclusive flags.

       -g     Generate the secret.  If this, -s and -T are absent, the user will
              be prompted for the secret to hash.  -s, -g and -T are mutually
              exclusive flags.  If this is present, {CLEARTEXT} is used as
              scheme.  -g and -h are mutually exclusive flags.

       -T_"file"
              Hash the contents of the file.  If this, -g and -s are absent, the
              user will be prompted for the secret to hash.  -s, -g and -T and
              mutually exclusive flags.

       -h_"scheme"
              If -h is specified, one of the following RFC 2307 schemes may be
              specified: {CRYPT}, {MD5}, {SMD5}, {SSHA}, and {SHA}.  The default
              is {SSHA}.

              Note that scheme names may need to be protected, due to { and },
              from expansion by the user's command interpreter.

              {SHA} and {SSHA} use the SHA-1 algorithm (FIPS 160-1), the latter
              with a seed.

              {MD5} and {SMD5} use the MD5 algorithm (RFC 1321), the latter with
              a seed.

              {CRYPT} uses the crypt(3).

              {CLEARTEXT} indicates that the new password should be added to
              userPassword as clear text.  Unless {CLEARTEXT} is used, this flag
              is incompatible with option -g.

       -c_crypt-salt-format
              Specify the format of the salt passed to crypt(3) when generating
              {CRYPT} passwords.  This string needs to be in sprintf(3) format
              and may include one (and only one) %s conversion.  This conversion
              will be substituted with a string of random characters from
              [A-Za-z0-9./].  For example, '%.2s' provides a two character salt
              and '$1$%.8s' tells some versions of crypt(3) to use an MD5
              algorithm and provides 8 random characters of salt.  The default
              is '%s', which provides 31 characters of salt.

       -n     Omit the trailing newline; useful to pipe the credentials into a
              command.

LIMITATIONS
       The practice of storing hashed passwords in userPassword violates
       Standard Track (RFC 4519) schema specifications and may hinder
       interoperability.  A new attribute type, authPassword, to hold hashed
       passwords has been defined (RFC 3112), but is not yet implemented in
       slapd(8).

       It should also be noted that the behavior of crypt(3) is platform
       specific.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
       Use of hashed passwords does not protect passwords during protocol
       transfer.  TLS or other eavesdropping protections should be in-place
       before using LDAP simple bind.

       The hashed password values should be protected as if they were clear text
       passwords.
