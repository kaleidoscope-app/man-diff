DESCRIPTION
     Newfs_hfs builds an HFS Plus file system on the specified special device.
     Before running newfs_hfs the disk should be partitioned using the Disk
     Utility application or pdisk(8).

     The file system default parameters are calculated based on the size of the
     disk partition. Typically the defaults are reasonable, however newfs_hfs
     has several options to allow the defaults to be selectively overridden.
     The options are as follows:

     -N [partition-size]
                 Causes the file system parameters to be printed out without
                 really creating the file system.  If the argument following the
                 -N starts with a decimal digit, it is assumed to be a partition
                 size.  The paritition size may be given in decimal, octal (with
                 leading `0'), or hexadecimal (with leading `0x').  The
                 partition size argument can be specified in 512-byte blocks
                 (with a `b' suffix), petabytes (`p' suffix), terabytes (`t'
                 suffix), gigabytes (`g' suffix), megabytes (`m' suffix), or
                 kilobytes (`k' suffix).  All suffixes indicate binary, not
                 decimal, multipliers (e.g., `1k' is 1024 bytes).  If no suffix
                 is specified, the value is assumed to be in bytes; if an
                 illegal suffix is specified, it results in a size of 0 bytes.

                 If the partition size is given, then no special device argument
                 shall be provided.  If no partition size is given, then the
                 size of the given special device is used instead, and the
                 special device will not be written to.

     -U uid      Set the owner of the file system's root directory to uid.

     -G gid      Set the group of the file system's root directory to gid.

     -M mask     Specify the octal access permissions mask for the file system's
                 root directory.

     -P          Set kHFSContentProtectionBit in the volume's attributes, which
                 will cause the volume to be mounted with the "protect" option
                 if the kernel supports it.

     -s          Creates a case-sensitive HFS Plus filesystem. By default a
                 case-insensitive filesystem is created.  Case-sensitive HFS
                 Plus file systems require a Mac OS X version of 10.3 (Darwin
                 7.0) or later.

     -b block-size
                 The allocation block size of the file system.  The default
                 value is 4096.

     -c clump-size-list
                 This specifies the clump and/or initial sizes, in allocation
                 blocks, for the various metadata files.  Clump sizes are
                 specified with the -c option followed by a comma separated list
                 of the form arg=blocks.

                 Example:  -c c=5000,e=500

                 a=blocks    Set the attribute file clump size.

                 b=blocks    Set the allocation bitmap file clump size.

                 c=blocks    Set the catalog file clump size.

                 d=blocks    Set the data fork clump size.

                 e=blocks    Set the extent overflow file clump size.

                 r=blocks    Set the resource fork clump size.

     -i first-cnid
                 This specifies the initial catalog node ID for user files and
                 directories. The default value is 16.

     -I initial-size-list
                 This specifies the initial size, in allocation blocks, for the
                 various metadata files.  Initial sizes are specified with the
                 -I option followed by a comma separated list of the form
                 arg=blocks.

                 Example:  -I c=5000,e=500

                 a=blocks    Set the initial attribute file size.

                 c=blocks    Set the initial catalog file size.

                 e=blocks    Set the initial extent overflow file size.

     -J [journal-size]
                 Creates a journaled HFS+ volume.  The default journal size
                 varies, based on the size of the volume.  Appending an 'M' to
                 the journal size implies megabytes (i.e. 64M is 64 megabytes).
                 The maximum journal size is 1024 megabytes.

     -D journal-device
                 Creates the journal on special device journal-device.

     -n node-size-list
                 This specifies the b-tree node sizes, in bytes, for the various
                 b-tree files.  Node sizes are specified with the -n option
                 followed by a comma separated list of the form arg=bytes. The
                 node size must be a power of two and no larger than 32768
                 bytes.

                 Example:  -n c=8192,e=4096

                 a=bytes     Set the attribute b-tree node size.

                 c=bytes     Set the catalog b-tree node size.

                 e=bytes     Set the extent overflow b-tree node size.

     -v volume-name
                 Volume name (file system name) in ascii or UTF-8 format.

HISTORY
     The newfs_hfs command appeared in Mac OS X Server 1.0 .  As of Mac OS X
     10.6, this utility no longer generates HFS standard file systems.
