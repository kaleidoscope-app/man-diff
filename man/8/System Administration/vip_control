VIP_CONTROL(8)               System Manager's Manual              VIP_CONTROL(8)



NAME
       vip_control - manipulate virtual IP information for Xsan

SYNOPSIS
       /System/Library/Filesystems/acfs.fs/Contents/bin/vip_control option

DESCRIPTION
       vip_control provides a mechanism for editing, listing, activating and
       deactivating virtual IPs (VIPs) for the Xsan system.  Virtual IPs may be
       helpful for applications needing access to the primary MDC when running
       in an HA configuration.  Changes made to VIPs are not automatically
       copied over to an MDC's HA peer.  As such, any changes that are made to
       the VIP configuration need to be done on both HA MDCs.  vip_control does
       not update firewall rules.  Changes to VIP configurations may require
       additional changes to the firewall rules of the system.

OPTIONS
       -h     Display help

       -a     Activate all configured VIPs

       -d     Deactivate all configured VIPs

       -i     Show VIP status along with physical NIC status

       -l     Show configured VIPs in a compact format

       -u vip_str
              Update the VIP configuration with the vip_str string.  This
              replaces the contents of the VIP configuration file.  The format
              of vip_str is as follows:

                 MAC address, IPV4 VIP, netmask, IPV6 VIP, prefix length

       Each field in a VIP entry is separated by a comma, and each VIP entry can
       be separated by either a newline or a semicolon.  Typically, the
       semicolon is used.

       The following is an example of setting up two VIPs:

          # vip_control -u "0030482D38F6,10.0.0.2,255.255.255.0,,;0030482d38f7,10.1.0.2,255.255.255.0,,;"

NOTES
       When changing the ha_vip.txt on Quantum Appliance you also need to make
       sure that the iptables rules are updated to reflect the new information.
       You can use the following command to reset the VIP

          # /opt/DXi/scripts/netcfg.sh --reset_snvip

FILES
       /Library/Preferences/Xsan/ha_vip.txt /opt/DXi/scripts/netcfg.sh
