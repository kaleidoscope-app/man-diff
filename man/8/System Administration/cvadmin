CVADMIN(8)                   System Manager's Manual                  CVADMIN(8)



NAME
       cvadmin - Administer an Xsan File System

SYNOPSIS
       cvadmin [-H FSMHostName] [-F VolumeName] [-M] [-n] [-x] [-f filename]
              [-e command1 -e command2...]

DESCRIPTION
       cvadmin is an interactive command used for general purpose administration
       of an Xsan volume including:

       1. displaying file system and client status

       2. activating a file system currently in stand-by mode

       3. viewing storage pool attributes

       4. enabling File System Manager (FSM) tracing

       5. displaying disk and path information for the local system

       6. forcing FSM failover

       7. fetching FSM usage and performance statistics

       8. temporarily enabling or disabling global file locking

       9. generating a report of open files

       10. listing currently held file locks

       11. starting, restarting and stopping of daemon processes

       12. resetting RPL information

OPTIONS
       Invoke cvadmin to start the interactive session and list the running File
       System Managers (FSMs).  (Note: Xsan system services must be started
       prior to running cvadmin.  In particular, the local fsmpm(8) process must
       be active.)

       The initial output shows the running FSMs grouped by the cluster in which
       they are located. The hostnames or IP addresses are those that are
       advertised to clients. When more than one location is listed, one or more
       these will be marked as preferred. This means that this address is on the
       metadata network and should be used, if possible, by a client to make a
       connection to the FSM. The remaining addresses can be used if a
       connection can not be made using a preferred address.

       Note: An administrator can filter out addresses that are not to be
       advertised by using the snfs_metadata_network_filter.json(5)
       configuration file.

       Then (optionally) use the select command described below to pick an FSM
       to connect to.  Once connected, the command will display basic
       information about the selected volume and prompt for further commands.

       Note that a few commands such as paths, disks, start, and stop require
       information obtained from the local fsmpm(8) only, so there is is no need
       to select an FSM prior to using them.

USAGE
       -H FSMHostName
              Connect to the FSM located on the machine FSMHostName. By default
              cvadmin will attempt to connect to an FSM located on the local
              machine.

       -F VolumeName
              Automatically set the volume VolumeName as the active volume in
              cvadmin.

       -M     When listing file systems with the select command, display
              [managed] next to each file system with DataMigration enabled.
              This option is currently only intended for use by support
              personnel.

       -f filename
              Read commands from filename

       -e command
              Execute command(s) and exit

       -n     Show numerical addresses instead of trying to determine symbolic
              host

       -x     Enable extended commands.

COMMANDS
       The cvadmin commands can be used to display and modify the Xsan active
       configuration. When a modification is made, it exists only as long as the
       FSM is running. More permanent changes can be made in the configuration
       file. Refer to the snfs_config(5) man page for details. The following
       commands are supported.

       The syntax for volume_name is: name[@cluster[/addom]]


       activate volume_name [hostname_or_IP_address]
              Activate a volume volume_name.  This command may cause an FSM to
              activate.  If the FSM is already active, no action is taken.

       activate volume_name number_of_votes
              Apple Internal only.  Bypass the election system and attempt to
              activate the fsm on this node.

       cluster select [N|[+]cluster_name]
              Select a cluster to be used by other commands when the cluster
              name isn't explicitly given with the FSM name.  Normally only a
              known cluster name can be selected, but preceding it with a '+'
              will force an unknown cluster name to be used.  A cluster name of
              none or 0 will de-select the currently selected cluster name.
              Using no arguments or just select will show all known clusters.
              Cluster_name is [@]cluster[/addom].

       cluster filter [N|cluster_name]
              Set a filter for the output of the select command.  When a cluster
              filter is set, only FSMs in that cluster will be displayed by
              select.  The filter can be set to all the clusters in an
              administrative domain by using  A cluster name of none or 0 will
              disable the filter.  Using no arguments or just filter will show
              all known clusters.  Cluster_name is [@]cluster[/addom].

       coord [[on] hostname_or_IP_address]
              Display the list of NSS coordinators on the local host or on the
              specified host.

       clientunmount gentle_time_in_seconds

       clientunmount hard gentle_time_in_seconds force_time_in_seconds
              Instruct clients of the selected volume to unmount. The first form
              of the command waits gentle_time_in_seconds seconds for clients to
              unmount the volume. Clients receive a message from the fsm
              directing them to normally unmount the volume.  During this time,
              no new client connections are permitted. If all clients unmount
              within that time, the fsm continues with new connections
              forbidden.

              In the second form of the command, the fsm moves to a second stage
              if any clients fail to unmount. In this stage, clients are
              instructed to unmount the volume forcibly. The fsm waits
              force_time_in_seconds seconds, and then completes the operation.
              Client connections remain forbidden at the end of this operation.

              After completing this command, the administrator should stop the
              volume.

       debug [[+|-] flag [ ... ]]
              View or set the File System Manager's debugging flags. Entering
              the command with no flag will return current settings, the
              location of the FSM log file and a legend describing what each
              setting does.  By entering the command with a flag list, the FSM
              Debugging Flags will be set accordingly.  Each flag can be either
              a name or numeric value.  Names will be mapped to their numeric
              value, and may be abbreviated as long as they remain unique.
              Numeric values are specified using a standard decimal or
              hexadecimal (0x) value of up to 32 bits.  Using '+' or '-' enables
              ('+') or disables ('-') only the selected flags, leaving all other
              flags unchanged.

              NOTE - Setting Debugging Flags will severely impact the FSM's
              performance!  Do this only when directed by a Apple specialist.

       discon Forcefully disconnect a client from the FSM.  With no arguments,
              discon displays the list of connected clients. When supplied an
              index, discon will immediately disconnect the specified client.
              Only use when recommended by Technical Support.  Also see the
              "repblocked" command.

       disks [refresh]
              Display the Xsan disk volumes local to the system that cvadmin is
              attached to. Using the optional refresh argument will force the
              fsmpm to re-scan all volumes before responding. If the fsmpm's
              view of the disks in any file system changes compared with the
              FSM's view of that client's disks as a result of the refresh, a
              disconnect and reconnect to the FSM will take place to
              resynchronise the file system state.

       disks [refresh] fsm
              Display the Xsan meta-data disk volumes in use by the fsm.  If the
              optional refresh argument is used, additional paths to these
              volumes may be added by the fsm.

       fail [volume_name|index_number]
              Initiate an FSM Failover of volume volume_name. This command may
              cause a stand-by FSM to activate. If an FSM is already active, the
              FSM will shut down. A stand-by FSM will then take over. If a
              stand-by FSM is not available the primary FSM will re-activate
              after failover processing is complete.

       files  Report counts of files, directories, symlinks and other objects
              which are anchored by a user type inode. These include named
              streams, block and character device files, fifos or pipes and
              named sockets.  If the file system is undergoing conversion to
              StorNext 5.0, conversion progress is displayed and counters
              reflect the count of converted objects.

       fsmlist [volume_name] [ on hostname_or_IP_address]
              Display the state of FSM processes, running or not.  Optionally
              specify a single volume_name to display.  Optionally specify the
              host name or IP address of the system on which to list the FSM
              processes.

       filelocks
              Query cluster-wide file/record lock enforcement.  Currently
              cluster-wide file locks are automatically used on Unix.  Windows
              file/record locks are optional.

              If enabled, byte-range file locks are coordinated through the FSM,
              allowing a lock set by one client to block overlapping locks by
              other clients.  If disabled, then byte-range locks are local to a
              client and do not prevent other clients from getting byte-range
              locks on a file, however they do prevent overlapping lock attempts
              on the same client.

       help (?)
              The help or ? command will display a command usage summary.

       latency-test [index_number|all] [seconds]
              Run an I/O latency test between the FSM process and one client or
              all clients.  The default test duration is 2 seconds.

       metadata
              Report metadata usage.  Also provide an estimate on the value of
              bufferCacheSize that will allow all metadata to be cached.

       mdarchive [status|backup|rebuild|prune]
              Run commands targeting the metadata archive associated with the
              selected FSM.  Running mdarchive without command arguments will
              display the full path location of the metadata archive.

       mdarchive status
              The status command prints the progress of the current metadata
              archive activity, if any. If generating a new metadata archive or
              restoring an existing one, the percentage complete will be
              displayed. Otherwise, the current update backlog is displayed.

       mdarchive rebuild [new]
              If metadataArchiveDays is set to zero then the rebuild command
              will force the FSM to discard the existing metadata archive and
              generate a new one, otherwise the FSM will rebuild the existing
              metadata archive in a way that will preserve history across the
              rebuild. Rebuilds can be performed online while clients are active
              in the file system.

              When metadataArchiveDays is set to a value greater than zero,
              requesting a new rebuild will cause the FSM to delete the current
              metadata archive before starting the rebuild. All metadata history
              that existed prior to the new rebuild will be lost but the rebuild
              will shrink the mdarchive down to its minimum size. Requesting a
              new rebuild has no effect when metadataArchiveDays is set to zero
              because the existing metadata archive is always deleted before
              starting the rebuild in that case.

              WARNING: When using the new argument to the rebuild command, all
              metadata history that existed prior to the rebuild will be lost.
              This will prevent external applications like snaudit and snhistory
              from reporting events that occurred prior to the rebuild and will
              prevent snrecover from recovering files that were deleted prior to
              the rebuild.

       mdarchive rebuild wait
              Wait for an ongoing rebuild to complete and report status
              periodically.

       mdarchive backup [full|partial] pathname
              For an FSM with a current mdarchive, request a backup copy be
              generated as a compressed tar file.  The pathname must specify an
              existing directory on the FSM node and include the file name to be
              created.  A full dump contains all the content, a partial dump
              contains all the content changed since the last backup.

       mdarchive backup wait
              Wait for an ongoing mdarchive backup to complete and report
              progress periodically.

       mdarchive prune
              The prune command will force the removal of expired historical
              data from the metadata archive. This command is ignored and a
              message is written to the system log file if metadataArchiveDays
              is set to zero in the configuration file or if it is issued while
              an mdarchive build, file recovery, or metadata restore is in
              progress.

       paths  Display the Xsan disk volumes visible to the local system.  The
              display is grouped by <controller> identity, and will indicate the
              "Active" or "Passive" nature of the path if the Raid Controller
              has been recognized as configured in Active/Active mode with AVAT
              enabled.

       proxy [long]
              Display Disk Proxy servers and optionally display the disks they
              serve for this volume.

       proxy who hostname
              The "who" option displays all proxy connections for the specified
              host.

       qbm trace [clientid]
              Create a QBM internal trace file on the MDC.  If clientid is
              specified (where clientid is the client's login id), a client
              trace is also also generated.  This command creates an SNQBM_xxx
              file in the debug directory.  Currently, only Windows clients
              generate internal traces.  This command is for Quantum use only.

       qbm show stripe-group-num
              Show the QBM allocation table for a stripe group given the stripe-
              group index.  All bandwidth (BW) is in MB/sec.  The display
              includes the following sub-tables:

              Stripe Group (SG) Table: SG max (capacity), BW currently free, the
              total BW in the reserve pools, and the total over-subscripted
              (over capacity) amount.

              Priority (Pri) Table: table class name, count of clients in the
              priority, total bandwidth allocated at this priority, minimum BW,
              maximum BW, extra (over min) BW, reserved BW used/total reserve
              allocated to this priority, and current BW used.

              Client Entry: list number, IP address, client login number,
              bandwidth information - minimum, maximum and current BW, restore
              BW, flag (l - client asked for less, m - client asked for more, g
              - client given more BW over minimum BW).

       qbm newconfig
              Re-read the <_file_system_name_>_qbm.conf file and update the
              clients.

       qos    Display per-stripe group QOS statistics.  Per-client QoS
              statistics are also displayed under each qos-configured stripe
              group.

       quit   This command will disconnect cvadmin from the FSM and exit.

       ras enq [ nomerge ] event "detail string"
              Generate an SNFS RAS event.  If "nomerge" is specified, multiple
              instances of the RAS event are not merged into a single ticket.
              For internal use only.

       ras enq [ nomerge ] event reporting_FRU violating_FRU "detail string"
              Generate a generic RAS event.  If "nomerge" is specified, multiple
              instances of the RAS event are not merged into a single ticket.
              For internal use only.

       repblocked
              Generate a report of files that may be causing open operations to
              block due to an unresponsive client that is slow to acknowledge a
              request to change state.  Such clients should be inspected to
              determine whether there is a reason for their lack of response.
              One common cause of unresponsiveness is that Xsan clients have
              entered sleep mode. The settings on these clients should be
              adjusted so they never sleep. If the client is known to be hung,
              the connection to the FSM can be reset using the discon command.

       repfl  Generate a report that displays the file locks currently held.
              Note: this command is only intended for debugging purposes by
              support personnel.  In future releases, the format of the report
              may change or the command may be removed entirely. Running the
              repfl command will write out a report file and display the output
              filename.

       repof  Generate a report that displays all files that are currently open
              on each Xsan client.  Running the repof command will write out a
              report file and display the output filename containing that
              report.
              The information displayed for each file is: the pathname, inode
              number, the number of "writers" (which is the # of times this
              client has opened the file for write -- usually 1 or 0), and stat
              information.
              Next a line is printed showing the open state across all clients.
              The open state contains: the count of different clients with this
              file open, the # of those clients that are writers, and which
              client, if non-zero, has the file open exclusively or that owns
              the ioToken.  The open state flags are displayed followed by a set
              of strings indicating the meaning of some of the bits in the flags
              field.  Some examples:

              flags 0x2000: shared_read
              flags 0x5000: I/O token shared_excl
              flags 0x5009: revoking I/O token shared_excl
              flags 0x9: revoking OLD Exclusive

              If revoking is indicated, that means the client(s) has been sent a
              message and a response is being awaited.  If client is zero with
              revoking, a message was sent to one or more clients in
              shared_read.
              See also the repblocked command.

              In future releases, the format of the report may change.

       resetrpl [clear]
              Repopulate Reverse Path Lookup (RPL) information.  The optional
              clear argument causes existing RPL data to be cleared before
              starting repopulation.  Note: resetrpl is only available when
              cvadmin is invoked with the -x option.  Running resetrpl may
              significantly delay FSM activation.  This command is not intended
              for general use.  Only run resetrpl when recommended by Technical
              Support.

       restartd daemon [once]
              Restart the daemon process.  For internal use only.

       select [volume_name|N]
              Select an active FSM to view and modify.  If no argument is
              specified, a numbered list of FSMs and running utilities will be
              displayed. If there is only one active volume in the list, it will
              automatically be selected.

              When a running utility is displayed by the select command, it will
              show the following information. First the name of the file system
              is displayed. Following that, in brackets "[]", is the name of the
              utility that is running. Third, a letter indicating the access
              type of the operation. The options here are (W) for read-write
              access, (R) for read-only access and (U) for unique access.
              Finally, the location and process id of the running utility is
              displayed.

              If volume_name is specified, then cvadmin will connect to the
              current active FSM for that volume.  If N (a number) is specified,
              cvadmin will connect to the Nth FSM in the list.  However, only
              active FSMs may be selected in this form.

       show [poolname] [long]
              Display information about the storage pools associated with the
              selected volume. If a storage pool name poolname is given only
              that storage pool's information will be given. Omitting the
              poolname argument will display all storage pools associated with
              the active file system. Using the long modifier will additionally
              display detailed information about the disk units associated with
              displayed storage pools.

       start volume_name [on hostname_or_IP_address]
              Start a File System Manager for the volume volume_name.  When the
              command is running on an MDC of an HA cluster, the local FSM is
              started, and then an attempt is made to start the FSM on the peer
              MDC as identified by the /Library/Preferences/Xsan/ha_peer file.
              When the optional hostname_or_IP_address is specified, the FSM is
              started on that MDC only.  The volume's configuration file must be
              operational and placed in
              /Library/Preferences/Xsan/<volume_name>.cfg before invoking this
              command.  See snfs_config(5) for information on how to create a
              configuration file for an Xsan volume.

       startd daemon [once]
              Start the daemon process.  For internal use only.

       stat   Display the general status of the volume. The output will show the
              number of clients connected to the volume. This count includes any
              administrative programs, such as cvadmin. Also shown are some of
              the static file-system-wide values such as the block size, number
              of storage pools, number of mirrored storage pools and number of
              disk devices.  The output also shows total blocks and free blocks
              for the entire volume.

       stats client_IP_address [clear]
              Display read/write statistics for the selected file system.  This
              command connects to the host FSMPM who then collects statistics
              from the file system client. The ten most active files by bytes
              read and written and by the number of read/write requests are
              displayed.  If clear is specified, zero the stats after printing.

       stop volume_name [on hostname_or_IP_address]
              Stop the File System Manager for volume_name.  This will shut down
              the FSM for the specified volume on every MDC.  When the optional
              hostname or IP address is specified, the FSM is stopped on that
              MDC only.  Further operations to the volume will be blocked in
              clients until an FSM for the volume is activated.

       stopd daemon
              Start the daemon process.  For internal use only.

       winidmap __username__
              Show the MDC-mapped user id and group information for the
              username.

       who    Query client list for the active volume. The output will show the
              following information for each client.

              Type      -  Type of connection. The client types are:
                 FSM - File System Manager(FSM) process
                 ADM - Administrative(cvadmin) connection
                 CLI - Volume client connection. May be followed by a CLI
                       type character:
                       S - Disk Proxy Server
                       C - Disk Proxy Client
                       H - Disk Proxy Hybrid Client. This is a client that has
                           been configured as a proxy client but is operating
                           as a SAN client.
              Location  - The client's hostname or IP address that was used by
              this client to connect to the FSM.
              Up Time   - The time since the client connection was initiated

EXAMPLES
       Invoke the cvadmin command for volume named snfs1.


          [root@dev-snc-daiquiri-n1 debug]# cvadmin -F snfs1
