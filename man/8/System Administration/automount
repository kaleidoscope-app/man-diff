AUTOMOUNT(8)                 System Manager's Manual                AUTOMOUNT(8)

NAME
     automount â€“ mount autofs on the appropriate mount points

SYNOPSIS
     automount [-v] [-c] [-u] [-t timeout]

DESCRIPTION
     automount reads the /etc/auto_master file, and any local or network maps it
     includes, and mounts autofs on the appropriate mount points to cause mounts
     to be triggered.  It will also attempt to unmount any top-level autofs
     mounts that correspond to maps no longer found.

OPTIONS
     -v      Print more detailed information about actions taken by automount.

     -c      Tell automountd(8) to flush any cached information it has.

     -u      Unmount all non-busy automounted mounts.  Top-level triggers are
             preserved.

     -t timeout
             Set to timeout seconds the time after which an automounted file
             system will be unmounted if it hasn't been referred to within that
             period of time.  The default is 10 minutes (600 seconds).

FILES
     /etc/autofs.conf
             configuration file for automount and automountd.

     /etc/auto_master
             The master map contains a list of directories to be controlled by
             autofs and their associated direct map or indirect maps.
