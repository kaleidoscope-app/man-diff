SYNOPSIS
     AssetCacheManagerUtil [-a|--all] [-j|--json] [-l|--linger] command

DESCRIPTION
     AssetCacheManagerUtil controls the macOS Content Cache.
     AssetCacheManagerUtil must be run by root except as noted below.  The
     options are:

     -a|--all
             Show all events, not just the end result of the specified command.

     -j|--json
             Print results in machine-parseable JSON format to stdout.

     -l|--linger
             Linger after completing command, to show other events.

     The commands are:

     activate
             Activates the content cache.  Content caching is deactivated by
             default.  After you activate content caching, restart devices on
             your network to take advantage of content caching immediately.
             Devices on your network will discover this content cache over time.
             Devices that are restarted will use this content cache immediately.

     deactivate
             Deactivates the content cache.

     isActivated
             Reports the content cache's activation status.  Does not require
             root.

     canActivate
             Reports whether the content cache is eligible for activation.  Does
             not require root.

     flushCache
             Flushes the content cache.

     flushPersonalCache
             Flushes all personal (iCloud) content from the content cache.

     flushSharedCache
             Flushes all shared (non-iCloud) content from the content cache.

     status  Reports the content cache's status.  Does not require root.

     settings
             Reports the content cache's settings.  Does not require root.

     reloadSettings
             Forces the content cache to reload its settings.

     moveCacheTo path
             Moves the cache to path.  The path must end with
             /Library/Application Support/Apple/AssetCache/Data.  The contents
             of path are deleted and replaced with the cache.

     absorbCacheFrom path read-only|and-destroy
             Imports the cache from path.  The path must end with either
             /Library/Application Support/Apple/AssetCache/Data or
             /Library/Server/Caching/Data.  If the last argument is read-only
             the cache at path is not modified, otherwise it is emptied.  This
             command only starts the absorption, which proceeds and finishes in
             the background.  Use the log(1) command to view progress, for
             example: log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.apple.AssetCache"'
             --style compact --last 5m
