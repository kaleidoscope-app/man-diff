NAME
     osaapplet – Open Scripting Architecture (OSA) applet interpreter

SYNOPSIS
     osaapplet path

DESCRIPTION
     osaapplet provides the standard script application “shell” for an Open
     Scripting Architecture (OSA) script.  It provides a menu bar and optional
     splash dialog, and handles routing incoming Apple events to the script,
     notably the run and open events.  It is normally used as the interpreter
     for a script file, like this:

           #!/usr/libexec/osaapplet

     The script, which may be compiled script data, may either follow the
     interpreter line or be a separate file in the traditional bundle location
     Resources/Scripts/main.scpt.  osaapplet assumes that it is running inside a
     bundle; running it without a bundle may produce unexpected results.

HISTORY
     osaapplet was introduced in OS X 10.10.
