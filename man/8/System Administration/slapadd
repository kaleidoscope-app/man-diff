SLAPADD(8C)                                                          SLAPADD(8C)



NAME
       slapadd - Add entries to a SLAPD database

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/slapadd [-b_suffix] [-c] [-d_debug-level] [-f_slapd.conf]
       [-F_confdir] [-g] [-j_lineno] [-l_ldif-file] [-n_dbnum]
       [-o_option[=value]] [-q] [-s] [-S_SID] [-u] [-v] [-w]

DESCRIPTION
       Slapadd is used to add entries specified in LDAP Directory Interchange
       Format (LDIF) to a slapd(8) database.  It opens the given database
       determined by the database number or suffix and adds entries
       corresponding to the provided LDIF to the database.  Databases configured
       as subordinate of this one are also updated, unless -g is specified.  The
       LDIF input is read from standard input or the specified file.

       All files eventually created by slapadd will belong to the identity
       slapadd is run as, so make sure you either run slapadd with the same
       identity slapd(8) will be run as (see option -u in slapd(8)), or change
       file ownership before running slapd(8).

       Note: slapadd will also perform the relevant indexing whilst adding the
       database if any are configured. For specfic details, please see
       slapindex(8).

OPTIONS
       -b_suffix
              Use the specified suffix to determine which database to add
              entries to.  The -b cannot be used in conjunction with the -n
              option.

       -c     enable continue (ignore errors) mode.

       -d_debug-level
              enable debugging messages as defined by the specified debug-level;
              see slapd(8) for details.

       -f_slapd.conf
              specify an alternative slapd.conf(5) file.

       -F_confdir
              specify a config directory.  If both -f and -F are specified, the
              config file will be read and converted to config directory format
              and written to the specified directory.  If neither option is
              specified, an attempt to read the default config directory will be
              made before trying to use the default config file. If a valid
              config directory exists then the default config file is ignored.
              If dry-run mode is also specified, no conversion will occur.

       -g     disable subordinate gluing.  Only the specified database will be
              processed, and not its glued subordinates (if any).

       -j_lineno
              Jump to the specified line number in the LDIF file before
              processing any entries. This allows a load that was aborted due to
              errors in the input LDIF to be resumed after the errors are
              corrected.

       -l_ldif-file
              Read LDIF from the specified file instead of standard input.

       -n_dbnum
              Add entries to the dbnum-th database listed in the configuration
              file.  The -n cannot be used in conjunction with the -b option.
              To populate the config database slapd-config(5), use -n 0 as it is
              always the first database. It must physically exist on the
              filesystem prior to this, however.

       -o_option[=value]
              Specify an option with a(n optional) value.  Possible generic
              options/values are:

                     syslog=<subsystems>  (see `-s' in slapd(8))
                     syslog-level=<level> (see `-S' in slapd(8))
                     syslog-user=<user>   (see `-l' in slapd(8))

                     schema-check={yes|no}
                     value-check={yes|no}

       The schema-check option toggles schema checking (default on);
       the value-check option toggles value checking (default off).
       The latter is incompatible with -q.

       -q     enable quick (fewer integrity checks) mode.  Does fewer consistency checks
              on the input data, and no consistency checks when writing the database.
              Improves the load time but if any errors or interruptions occur the resulting
              database will be unusable.

       -s     disable schema checking.  This option is intended to be used when loading
              databases containing special objects, such as fractional objects on a
              partial replica.  Loading normal objects which do not conform to
              schema may result in unexpected and ill behavior.

       -S_SID Server ID to use in generated entryCSN.  Also used for contextCSN
              if -w is set as well.  Defaults to 0.

       -u     enable dry-run (don't write to backend) mode.

       -v     enable verbose mode.

       -w     write syncrepl context information.
              After all entries are added, the contextCSN
              will be updated with the greatest CSN in the database.

LIMITATIONS
       Your slapd(8) should not be running when you do this to ensure
       consistency of the database.

       slapadd may not provide naming or schema checks.  It is advisable to use
       ldapadd(1) when adding new entries into an existing directory.

EXAMPLES
       To import the entries specified in file ldif into your slapd(8) database
       give the command:

            /usr/sbin/slapadd -l ldif
