APFS_CONDENSER(8)            System Manager's Manual           APFS_CONDENSER(8)

NAME
     apfs_condenser â€“ insert the contents of an existing B-tree into a new B-
     tree to improve B-tree space utilization

SYNOPSIS
     apfs_condenser [-s snap_name] [-w watchdog_timeout] [-v] -p device_path
                    -i filesystem_slice

DESCRIPTION
     The apfs_condenser command sequentially inserts the contents of an existing
     B-tree into a new B-tree to improve B-tree space utilization.  The
     apfs_condenser requires the container to be unmounted and an encrypted
     volume to be unlocked.  The filesystem_slice parameter is 1-based and the
     device_path parameter is the path of the device representing the container.

     The options are as follows:

     -s snap_name          If compaction succeeds, the snapshot will be deleted.
                           Usually used in the OTA environment.

     -v                    Increase verbosity of the output.

     -w timeout            Force the compaction to abort after the supplied
                           timeout in seconds.

EXIT STATUS
     The apfs_condenser utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     The following condenses the first APFS volume with /dev/disk1 as the
     synthesized container path :
           apfs_condenser -p /dev/disk1 -i 1

HISTORY
     The apfs_condenser utility first appeared in OS X 10.14.
