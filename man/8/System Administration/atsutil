DESCRIPTION
     atsutil tool controls some aspects of the font registration system.  It may
     be used remove font registration databases and caches, or list active
     fonts.

     fonts enumerates all fonts available to processes in the OS. It also
     performs a consistency check of the fonts available via font management
     APIs.

     files. Removing databases may cause the loss of font registration state:

     and font libraries. New databases will be regenerated from fonts installed
     the standard font directories after the user logs out, restarts, or the
     fontd server is restarted.
