MOUNT_NTFS(8)                System Manager's Manual               MOUNT_NTFS(8)

NAME
     mount_ntfs – mount an NTFS file system

SYNOPSIS
     mount_ntfs [-s] [-o options] special node

DESCRIPTION
     The mount_ntfs command attaches the NTFS file system residing on the device
     special to the global file system namespace at the location indicated by
     node.  This command is normally executed by mount(8) at boot time, but can
     be used by any user to mount an NTFS file system on any directory that they
     own (provided, of course, that they have appropriate access to the device
     that contains the file system).

     The options are as follows:

     -s      Mount the volume using case sensitive semantics.  This means that
             you can create files that have names that only differ in case such
             as for example "foo" and "Foo".  Without this option the volume is
             mounted using case insensitive semantics in which case if you
             create a file with name "foo" you then cannot create a file named
             "Foo" or rather if you do create a file named "Foo" it would
             overwrite the existing file "foo".

     -o      Options are specified with a -o flag followed by a comma separated
             string of options.  See the mount(8) man page for possible options
             and their meanings.
