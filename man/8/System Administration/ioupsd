IOUPSD(8)                    System Manager's Manual                   IOUPSD(8)

NAME
     ioupsd â€“ daemon to track UPS state

DESCRIPTION
     ioupsd monitors UPS's.  PowerManagement's configd plugin automatically
     launches ioupsd whenever a UPS is connected to the system. Most HID-
     compliant USB UPS's are supported at a basic level by OS X; further support
     must be provided by manufacturers.  If a UPS is unsupported, OS X will not
     automatically launch ioupsd.
