RACOON(8)                    System Manager's Manual                   RACOON(8)

NAME
     racoon – IKE (ISAKMP/Oakley) key management daemon

SYNOPSIS
     racoon [-46BdFLv] [-f configfile] [-l logfile]

DESCRIPTION
     racoon is used to setup and maintain an IPSec tunnel or transport channel,
     between two devices, over which network traffic is conveyed securely.  This
     security is made possible by cryptographic keys and operations on both
     devices.  racoon relies on a standardized network protocol (IKE) to
     automatically negotiate and manage the cryptographic keys (e.g. security
     associations) that are necessary for the IPSec tunnel or transport channel
     to function.  racoon speaks the IKE (ISAKMP/Oakley) key management
     protocol, to establish security associations with other hosts.  The SPD
     (Security Policy Database) in the kernel usually triggers racoon.  racoon
     usually sends all informational messages, warnings and error messages to
     syslogd(8) with the facility LOG_DAEMON and the priority LOG_INFO.
     Debugging messages are sent with the priority LOG_DEBUG.  You should
     configure syslog.conf(5) appropriately to see these messages.

     -4

     -6      Specify the default address family for the sockets.

     -B      Install SA(s) from the file which is specified in racoon.conf(5).

     -d      Increase the debug level.  Multiple -d arguments will increase the
             debug level even more.

     -F      Run racoon in the foreground.

     -f configfile
             Use configfile as the configuration file instead of the default.

     -L      Include file_name:line_number:function_name in all messages.

     -l logfile
             Use logfile as the logging file instead of syslogd(8).

     -v      This flag causes the packet dump be more verbose, with higher
             debugging level.

     racoon assumes the presence of the kernel random number device rnd(4) at
     /dev/urandom.

RETURN VALUES
     The command exits with 0 on success, and non-zero on errors.

FILES
     /private/etc/racoon/racoon.conf       default configuration file.
     /private/etc/racoon/psk.txt           default pre-shared key file.

SEE ALSO
     ipsec(4), racoon.conf(5), syslog.conf(5), setkey(8), syslogd(8)

HISTORY
     The racoon command first appeared in the “YIPS” Yokogawa IPsec
     implementation.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
     The use of IKE phase 1 aggressive mode is not recommended, as described in
     http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/886601.
