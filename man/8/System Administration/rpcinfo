DESCRIPTION
     rpcinfo makes an RPC call to an RPC server and reports what it finds.
     Unless otherwise specified or noted below the default rpcbind protocol
     version is 3.  With no or only generic options, call the rpcbind dump
     procedure on the specified host or “localhost” if host is not specified and
     display the results.  For versions 3 and 4 display the program number, the
     version, the “netid”, the universal address that the services is listening
     on, symbolic name of the program if known, and then the owner that
     registered the ⟨program, version, netid, address⟩ tuple.  For version 2 of
     the protocol list the program, version, protocol, port, and symbolic
     program name.  See the option below for a typically more useful output.
     rpcbind defaults the netid to “tcp” for the dump procedure.

     The program argument can be either a name or a number.

     If a version is specified, rpcinfo attempts to call that version of the
     specified program.  Otherwise, if the version is optional rpcinfo attempts
     to find all the registered version numbers for the specified program by
     calling version 0 (which is presumed not to exist; if it does exist,
     rpcinfo attempts to obtain this information by calling an extremely high
     version number instead) and attempts to call each registered version.

     A required transport option is needed for the second and third lines of the
     synopsis which is used to ping, i.e., call the null procedure of the
     specified program and version. The results will be displayed on stdout. If
     version is not specified each valid version found as described above will
     be called.  The third synopsis will use the supplied universal address over
     the transport specified by netid to call the null procedure of the
     specified program in the same manner as above. In addition the last two
     lines of the synopsis can “ping” the server as described in the Legacy
     Options section below.

GENERIC OPTIONS
     version
             Attempt to use the supplied rpcbind version. Note some options
             below are version specific and this option may be ignored. If
             specifying version 2 (portmapper), netid below must be one of “udp”
             or “tcp”.

     -T netid
             Specify the netid to use. Supported netids are “udp”, “tcp”,
             “udp6”, and “tcp6”.

     seconds
             Timeout used in creating client handles and the client calls to
             rpcbind. Current default is 12 seconds.

     Generic options may be supplied with any of the rpcinfo options below,
     though some options will override their values.

LEGACY OPTIONS
     The options below imply version 2 (portmapper) rpcbind calls. They are
     compatible with older versions of rpcinfo.

     {-p |} [-T netid] [host]
             Probe the portmapper on host, and print a list of all registered
             RPC programs.  If host is not specified, it defaults to the value
             “localhost”.

     {-u |} host program [version]
             Make an RPC call to the NULL procedure of program on the specified
             host using UDP, and report whether a response was received.

     {-t |} host program [version]
             Make an RPC call to the NULL procedure of program on the specified
             host using TCP, and report whether a response was received.

     {-n |} portnum
             Use portnum as the port number for the -t and -u options instead of
             the port number given by the portmapper.

OPTIONS
     {-b |} program version
             Make an RPC multicast over INET6 to the RPCB_MULTICAST_ADDR,
             “FF02::202”, and broadcast over INET using UDP to procedure 0 of
             the specified program and version and report all hosts that
             respond.  rpcifno will first use RPCBIND version 3 and then call
             the broadcast procedure of the portmapper protocol to collect older
             hosts. There is a reply cache kept so duplicates will not be
             returned unless the cache fills.

             Note that the -b option by its self is compatible with the older
             portmapper.  However, specifying
              2 will short circuit the rpcbind version 3 calls and only call the
             portmapper.

     {-d |} [-T netid] program version
             Delete registration for the RPC service of the specified program
             and version.  If the netid is specified, only unregister the
             program and version over that transport.  This option can be
             exercised only by the super-user or the user who registered the the
             RPC service.

     [-T netid] [host] program version
             Get the universal address that the client can use to contact the
             program and version from host over netid.  If host is not specified
             localhost is assumed. If netid is not specified “udp” is assumed.
             If the specified version is not available but some other version
             is, return the universal address for one of those versions of the
             program.

     [-T netid] [host] program version
             Get the universal address that the client can use to contact the
             program and version from host over netid.  If host is not specified
             localhost is assumed. If netid is not specified “udp” is assumed.
             If the version is not available then that will be indicated. This
             requires the remote rpcbind support version 4.

     -h      Print out the synopsis of this program.

             Print out the synopsis and an explanation of the options.

     [-T netid] [host] program version
             Send a indirect call to the null procedure of program and version
             on the specified host or localhost.  This requires the remote
             rpcbind to support version 4.

     {-l |} [-T netid] [host] program version
             List the transports available over the transport family specified
             by the netid for the given program and version on the optional host
             or localhost if not specified.  Requires the remote rpcbind to
             support version 4.  The default transport family is INET.

     {-m |}  Print the metrics of rpcbind daemon for the specified host or
             localhost if not specified.  Requires support for rpcbind version 4
             on the remote.

     {-s |}  Print a summary of programs registered on host or “localhost” if
             host is not specified.  For each program registered list any
             versions followed by any transports supported by that program. Try
             to list the symbolic name of the transport and the owner that
             registered the program.

     [host]  Return rpcbind's version of time on the specified host.

EXAMPLES
     To show all of the RPC services registered on the local machine use:

           example% rpcinfo

     To show all of the RPC services registered on the machine named klaxon use:

           example% rpcinfo klaxon

     More usefully to show the services registered on klaxon use:

           example% rpcinfo -s klaxon

     To show all of the RPC services from an older host only running version 2
     of rpcbind on a host named horn use:

           example% rpcinfo -p horn

     To show all machines on the local net that are running the NFS File service
     use:

           example% rpcinfo -b nfs 'version'

     where 'version' is one of the current nfs versions of interest.

     To delete the registration for version 1 of the rquotad service use:

           example% rpcinfo -d rquotad 1

BUGS
     In summary mode the maximum number of versions and transports is 16. The
     first 16 versions and the first 16 transports received from the server are
     displayed and the rest is silently ignored.

     In the second synopsis line, for a host that is specified as a link-local
     INET6 address will always return “no route to host”.

     In releases prior to SunOS 3.0, the Network File System (NFS) did not
     register itself with the portmapper; rpcinfo cannot be used to make RPC
     calls to the NFS server on hosts running such releases.
