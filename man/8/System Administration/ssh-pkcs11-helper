SSH-PKCS11-HELPER(8)         System Manager's Manual        SSH-PKCS11-HELPER(8)

NAME
     ssh-pkcs11-helper â€“ OpenSSH helper for PKCS#11 support

SYNOPSIS
     ssh-pkcs11-helper [-v]

DESCRIPTION
     ssh-pkcs11-helper is used by ssh-agent(1) to access keys provided by a
     PKCS#11 token.

     ssh-pkcs11-helper is not intended to be invoked by the user, but from
     ssh-agent(1).

     A single option is supported:

     -v      Verbose mode.  Causes ssh-pkcs11-helper to print debugging messages
             about its progress.  This is helpful in debugging problems.
             Multiple -v options increase the verbosity.  The maximum is 3.

             Note that ssh-agent(1) will automatically pass the -v flag to
             ssh-pkcs11-helper when it has itself been placed in debug mode.

SEE ALSO
     ssh(1), ssh-add(1), ssh-agent(1)

HISTORY
     ssh-pkcs11-helper first appeared in OpenBSD 4.7.
