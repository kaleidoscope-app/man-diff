EXFAT.UTIL(8)                System Manager's Manual               EXFAT.UTIL(8)

NAME
     exfat.util â€“ ExFAT file system utility

SYNOPSIS
     exfat.util -p device removable writable
     exfat.util -k device
     exfat.util -s device
     exfat.util -m device directory removable writable nosuid nodev
     exfat.util -u device

DESCRIPTION
     The exfat.util command supports the probing of ExFAT file systems, and
     getting or setting a volume UUID.

     Options:

     -p device removable writable
             Probe the device to determine whether it contains an ExFAT file
             system.  The removable and writable arguments are ignored for
             compatibility with other file system utilities.  If the device
             appears to contain an ExFAT file system, the exit status is 255.
             If the file system contains a label (volume name), that name is
             written to standard output.  If the device does not appear to
             contain an ExFAT file system, the exit status is 254.  An exit
             status of 252 indicates that an I/O error occurred.

     -k device
             Return the volume UUID of the ExFAT file system on device.  If the
             device appears to contain an ExFAT file system, the volume's UUID
             is written to standard output (as formatted by uuid_unparse(3)),
             and the exit status is 253.  If the root directory contains a
             Volume GUID entry, that GUID is the value returned; otherwise, the
             32-bit volume serial number stored in the boot sector is converted
             to a UUID and returned.  If the device does not appear to contain
             an ExFAT file system, the exit status is 254.  An exit status of
             252 indicates that an I/O error occurred.

             device may be mounted or unmounted.  If it is mounted, the UUID is
             obtained through the file system using the getattrlist(2) call.  If
             the device is not mounted, exfat.util reads from the device
             directly.

     -s device
             Set a new UUID for the ExFAT file system on device, which must not
             be mounted.  This generates a new UUID using uuid_generate(3) and
             stores that UUID in a Volume GUID entry in the root directory
             (creating one if one does not exist, or updating an existing
             entry).  If the UUID is successfully set, the exit status is 253.
             If the device does not appear to contain an ExFAT file system, the
             exit status is 254.  An exit status of 252 indicates that device
             was already mounted, or an I/O error occurred.

     -m device directory removable writable nosuid nodev
             Deprecated.  Mount the ExFAT file system from device onto
             directory.  The removable argument should be either removable if
             the device is removable, or fixed otherwise.  The actual argument
             value is currently ignored.  The writable argument must be either
             readonly or writable which mounts the volume read-only or
             read/write, respectively.  The nosuid argument must be either suid
             or nosuid.  That argument is passed as a mount option.  The nodev
             argument must be either dev or nodev.  That argument is passed as a
             mount option.

     -u device
             Deprecated.  Unmount the file system on device.  If the unmount is
             successful, the exit status is 253.

FILES
     The exfat.util command is installed in the
     /System/Library/Filesystems/exfat.fs/Contents/Resources directory, which is
     typically not in a shell's search path.

COMPATIBILITY
     The -m and -u options are deprecated.  The preferred way to mount an ExFAT
     volume is to let diskarbitrationd(8) mount it automatically when the device
     is discovered, or use the diskutil(8) command to explicitly mount a device.
     You may also use the mount(8) or mount_exfat(8) commands directly.  The
     preferred way to unmount an ExFAT volume is with the diskutil(8) command.
     Note that using the umount(8) command usually will not work because various
     process are likely to have open files, which will prevent the unmount.  The
     diskutil(8) command will send a notification that causes many such
     processes to close their open files so that the unmount will succeed.

SEE ALSO

     uuid_unparse(3), uuid_generate(3), getattrlist(2)

HISTORY
     The exfat.util utility first appeared in Mac OS X 10.6.3.

BUGS
     The choice of non-zero exit status to indicate success was an unfortunate
     design decision.

     The -u option usually does not work since several processes in Mac OS X
     leave files open on mounted volumes, thus preventing the unmount.  The
     diskutil(8) command is preferred for unmounting.
