REPQUOTA(8)                  System Manager's Manual                 REPQUOTA(8)

NAME
     repquota â€“ summarize quotas for a file system

SYNOPSIS
     repquota [-g] [-u] [-v] filesystem ...
     repquota [-g] [-u] [-v] -a

DESCRIPTION
     Repquota prints a summary of the disk usage and quotas for the specified
     file systems.

     Available options:

     -a      Print the quotas of all the filesystems configured with a quota
             mount option file at its root.

     -g      Print only group quotas (the default is to print both group and
             user quotas if they exist).

     -u      Print only user quotas (the default is to print both group and user
             quotas if they exist).

     -v      Print a header line before printing each filesystem quotas.

     For each user or group, the current number of files and amount of space (in
     kilobytes) is printed, along with any quotas created with edquota(8).

     Only members of the operator group or the super-user may use this command.

FILES
     Each of the following quota files is located at the root of the mounted
     filesystem.  The mount option files are empty files whose existence
     indicates that quotas are to be enabled for that filesystem.

     .quota.user       data file containing user quotas
     .quota.group      data file containing group quotas
     .quota.ops.user   mount option file used to enable user quotas
     .quota.ops.group  mount option file used to enable group quotas

SEE ALSO

DIAGNOSTICS

HISTORY
     The repquota command appeared in 4.2BSD.
