mDNSNetMonitor(8)            System Manager's Manual           mDNSNetMonitor(8)

NAME
     mDNSNetMonitor â€“ dumps mDNS traffic on a network

SYNOPSIS
     mDNSNetMonitor [-i interface] [host]

DESCRIPTION
     mDNSNetMonitor prints out a description of the contents of mDNS packets on
     a network interface. It is similiar to tcpdump in that it continuously
     captures packets until it is interrupted by a SIGINT signal (generated, for
     example, by typing your interrupt character, typically  control-C)  or a
     SIGTERM signal (typically generated with the kill(1) command).

     When mDNSNetMonitor finishes capturing packets, it will report counts of
     packets captured per mDNS packet type, service type and source device.

     Note that mDNSNetMonitor will not capture unicast mDNS packets.

OPTION
     -i interface    Displays packets on specified interface.

Example
     To print all packets arriving at or departing from sundown:
         % mDNSNetMonitor sundown
