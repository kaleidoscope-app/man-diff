DESCRIPTION
     This tool allows command-line configuration of the Active Directory.
     dsconfigad has the same functionality for configuring the Active Directory
     as the Directory Utility application.  It requires "admin" privileges to
     the local workstation and to the Directory to make changes.

     A list of flags and their descriptions:

     -add fqdn
              The fully-qualified DNS name of the Domain to be used when adding
              the computer to the Directory (e.g., domain.ads.example.com).

     -alldomains enable | disable
              This flag determines whether the plugin allows authentication from
              any domain in the forest.  When this is enabled, individual
              domains will not be visible, only "All Domains". If it is
              disabled, you will have the ability to select the specific domains
              that can authenticate to this computer. Enabled by default.

     -computer computerid
              The "computerid" to add the specified Domain

     -force   Force the process (i.e., join the existing account or remove the
              binding)

     -ggid attribute
              This specifies the attribute to be used for the GID of the group.
              By default, a group GID is generated from the Active Directory
              GUID of the group.

     -gid attribute
              This specifies the attribute to be used for the GID of the user.
              By default, a GID is derived from the primaryGroupID of the user
              (typically Domain Users).

     -groups group1,group2,...
              Use the listed groups to determine who has local administrative
              privileges on this computer.  Groups can be specified by domain to
              ensure security is not compromised, e.g., "domain
              admins@domain.ads.demo.com"

     -help    Lists the options for calling dsconfigad

     -leave   Leaves the current domain (preserving the computer record in the
              directory).

     -localhome enable | disable
              This flag determines whether the plugin forces all home
              directories to be local to the computer (i.e., /Users/username)
              (enabled by default).

     -localpassword password
              Password to use in conjunction with the specified local username.
              If this is not specified, you will be prompted for entry.  Note
              that using this option has a security risk due to a small window
              where the password could be captured from running process list.
              Consider using the prompting mechanism to ensure passwords are not
              exposed unexpectedly.

     -localuser username
              Username of a local account that has administrative privileges to
              this computer

     -mobile enable | disable
              This flag determines whether the plugin will enable mobile account
              support for offline logon (disabled by default).  This flag is a
              hint.  If the appopriate Workgroup Management settings exist for a
              user, this will not override, as directory settings for the user
              take precendence.

     -mobileconfirm enable | disable
              This flag determines whether the plugin will warn the user when a
              mobile account is going to be created.  This flag is a hint as
              discussed in -mobile

     -namespace forest | domain
              Sets the primary account username naming convention.  By default
              it is set to "domain" naming which assumes no conflicting user
              accounts across all domains.  If your Active Directory forest has
              conflicts setting this to "forest" will prefix all usernames with
              "DOMAIN\" to ensure unique naming between domains (e.g.,
              "ADDOMAIN\user1").  Warning:  this will change the primary name of
              the user for all logins.  Changing this setting on an existing
              system will cause any existing homes to be unused on the local
              machine.

     -noggid  Turn off any previously mapped attribute and generate the group
              GID from the Active Directory GUID.

     -nogid   Turn off any previously mapped attribute and use the GID from the
              directory.

     -nogroups
              Disable use of the current groups for determining administrative
              privileges on this computer.

     -nopreferred
              Turn off any previously specified server and default to dynamic
              server discovery.

     -nouid   Turn off any previously mapped attribute and generate the UID from
              the Active Directory GUID.

     -ou dn   The LDAP DN of the container to use for adding the computer.  If
              this is not specified, it will default to the container
              "CN=Computers" within the domain that was specified (e.g.,
              "CN=Computers,DC=domain,DC=ads,DC=demo,DC=com"

     -packetencrypt allow | disable | require | ssl
              By default packet encryption is allowed but not required, but can
              be required or disabled (for example if debugging a problem).
              This ensures that the data to/from the server is encrypted and
              signed guaranteeing the content was not tampered with and cannot
              be seen by other computers on the network.

     -packetsign allow | disable | require
              By default packet signing is allowed but not required, but can be
              required or disabled (for example if debugging a problem).  This
              ensures that the data to/from the server is not tampered with by
              another computer before received it is received.

     -passinterval value
              Set how often the computer trust account password should be
              changed (default 14).

     -password password
              Password to use in conjunction with the specified username.  If
              this is not specified, you will be prompted for entry.  Note that
              using this option has a security risk due to a small window where
              the password could be captured from running process list.
              Consider using the prompting mechanism to ensure passwords are not
              exposed unexpectedly.

     -preferred server
              Use the specified server for all Directory lookups and
              authentications.  If the server is no longer available, it will
              fail-over to other servers.

     -protocol afp | smb | nfs
              This flag determines how a home directory is mounted on the
              desktop.  By default SMB is used, but AFP can be used for use with
              Mac OS X Server or 3rd Party AFP solutions on Windows Servers
              (previously known as mountstyle)

     -restrictDDNS
              Restricts Dynamic DNS updates to specific interfaces (e.g., en0,
              en1, en2, etc.).  To disable restrictions pass "" as the list.

     -remove  Remove this computer from the current Domain

     -sharepoint enable | disable
              Enable or disable mounting of the network home as a sharepoint.

     -shell value
              Use the specified shell (e.g., "/bin/bash") if a shell attribute
              does not exist in the directory for the user logging into this
              computer.  Use a shell value of "none" to disable use of a default
              shell, preserving values that are only specified in the directory.

     -show    Shows the current configuration of the Active Directory

     -uid attribute
              This specifies the attribute to be used for the UID of the user.
              By default, a UID is generated from the Active Directory GUID.

     -username username
              Username of a Network account that has administrative privileges
              to add/remove this computer to/from the specified Domain

     -useuncpath enable | disable
              This flag determines whether the plugin uses the UNC specified in
              the Active Directory when mounting the network home.  If this is
              disabled, the plugin will look for Apple schema extensions to
              mount the home directory.

     -xml     Output in XML rather than plain text.  Valid only with -show.

EXAMPLES
     Adding a computer to a Directory:

     dsconfigad -add domain.ads.example.com -computer ThisComputer -username
     "administrator" -ou "CN=Computers,OU=Engineering,DC=ads,DC=example,DC=com"

     Giving a set of groups administrative access to the local computer:

     dsconfigad -groups "DOMAIN\domain admins,FOREST\enterprise
     admins,DOMAIN\desktop techs"
