POSTSCREEN(8)                System Manager's Manual               POSTSCREEN(8)




NAME
       postscreen - Postfix zombie blocker

SYNOPSIS
       postscreen [generic Postfix daemon options]

DESCRIPTION
       The Postfix postscreen(8) server provides additional protection against
       mail server overload. One postscreen(8) process handles multiple inbound
       SMTP connections, and decides which clients may talk to a Postfix SMTP
       server process.  By keeping spambots away, postscreen(8) leaves more SMTP
       server processes available for legitimate clients, and delays the onset
       of server overload conditions.

       This program should not be used on SMTP ports that receive mail from
       end-user clients (MUAs). In a typical deployment, postscreen(8) handles
       the MX service on TCP port 25, and smtpd(8) receives mail from MUAs on
       the submission service (TCP port 587) which requires client
       authentication.  Alternatively, a site could set up a dedicated,
       non-postscreen, "port 25" server that provides submission service and
       client authentication, but no MX service.

       postscreen(8) maintains a temporary whitelist for clients that have
       passed a number of tests.  When an SMTP client IP address is whitelisted,
       postscreen(8) hands off the connection immediately to a Postfix SMTP
       server process. This minimizes the overhead for legitimate mail.

       By default, postscreen(8) logs statistics and hands off each connection
       to a Postfix SMTP server process, while excluding clients in mynetworks
       from all tests (primarily, to avoid problems with non-standard SMTP
       implementations in network appliances).  This default mode blocks no
       clients, and is useful for non-destructive testing.

       In a typical production setting, postscreen(8) is configured to reject
       mail from clients that fail one or more tests. postscreen(8) logs
       rejected mail with the client address, helo, sender and recipient
       information.

       postscreen(8) is not an SMTP proxy; this is intentional.  The purpose is
       to keep spambots away from Postfix SMTP server processes, while
       minimizing overhead for legitimate traffic.

SECURITY
       The postscreen(8) server is moderately security-sensitive.  It talks to
       untrusted clients on the network. The process can be run chrooted at
       fixed low privilege.

STANDARDS

       RFC 1123 (Host requirements)
       RFC 1652 (8bit-MIME transport)
       RFC 1869 (SMTP service extensions)

       RFC 3463 (Enhanced Status Codes)
       RFC 5321 (SMTP protocol, including multi-line 220 banners)

DIAGNOSTICS
       Problems and transactions are logged to syslogd(8).

BUGS
       The postscreen(8) built-in SMTP protocol engine currently does not
       announce support for AUTH, XCLIENT or XFORWARD.  If you need to make
       these services available on port 25, then do not enable the optional
       "after 220 server greeting" tests.

       The optional "after 220 server greeting" tests may result in unexpected
       delivery delays from senders that retry email delivery from a different
       IP address.  Reason: after passing these tests a new client must
       disconnect, and reconnect from the same IP address before it can deliver
       mail. See POSTSCREEN_README, section "Tests after the 220 SMTP server
       greeting", for a discussion.

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
       Changes to main.cf are not picked up automatically, as postscreen(8)
       processes may run for several hours.  Use the command "postfix reload"
       after a configuration change.

       The text below provides only a parameter summary. See postconf(5) for
       more details including examples.

       NOTE: Some postscreen(8) parameters implement stress-dependent behavior.
       This is supported only when the default parameter value is
       stress-dependent (that is, it looks like ${stress?{X}:{Y}}, or it is the
       $name of an smtpd parameter with a stress-dependent default).  Other
       parameters always evaluate as if the stress parameter value is the empty
       string.

       ($smtpd_discard_ehlo_keyword_address_maps)
              Lookup tables, indexed by the remote SMTP client address, with
              case insensitive lists of EHLO keywords (pipelining, starttls,
              auth, etc.) that the postscreen(8) server will not send in the
              EHLO response to a remote SMTP client.

       postscreen_discard_ehlo_keywords ($smtpd_discard_ehlo_keywords)
              A case insensitive list of EHLO keywords (pipelining, starttls,
              auth, etc.) that the postscreen(8) server will not send in the
              EHLO response to a remote SMTP client.

       Available in Postfix version 3.1 and later:

       dns_ncache_ttl_fix_enable (no)
              Enable a workaround for future libc incompatibility.

TROUBLE SHOOTING CONTROLS

              postscreen(8) server response.

       soft_bounce (no)
              Safety net to keep mail queued that would otherwise be returned to
              the sender.

BEFORE-POSTSCREEN PROXY AGENT
       Available in Postfix version 2.10 and later:

       postscreen_upstream_proxy_protocol (empty)
              The name of the proxy protocol used by an optional
              before-postscreen proxy agent.

              The time limit for the proxy protocol specified with the
              postscreen_upstream_proxy_protocol parameter.

PERMANENT WHITE/BLACKLIST TEST
       This test is executed immediately after a remote SMTP client connects. If
       a client is permanently whitelisted, the client will be handed off
       immediately to a Postfix SMTP server process.

       postscreen_access_list (permit_mynetworks)
              Permanent white/blacklist for remote SMTP client IP addresses.

       postscreen_blacklist_action (ignore)
              The action that postscreen(8) takes when a remote SMTP client is
              permanently blacklisted with the postscreen_access_list parameter.

MAIL EXCHANGER POLICY TESTS
       When postscreen(8) is configured to monitor all primary and backup MX
       addresses, it can refuse to whitelist clients that connect to a backup MX
       address only. For small sites, this requires configuring primary and
       backup MX addresses on the same MTA. Larger sites would have to share the
       postscreen(8) cache between primary and backup MTAs, which would
       introduce a common point of failure.

       postscreen_whitelist_interfaces (static:all)
              A list of local postscreen(8) server IP addresses where a
              non-whitelisted remote SMTP client can obtain postscreen(8)'s
              temporary whitelist status.

BEFORE 220 GREETING TESTS
       These tests are executed before the remote SMTP client receives the "220
       servername" greeting. If no tests remain after the successful completion
       of this phase, the client will be handed off immediately to a Postfix
       SMTP server process.

              The action that postscreen(8) takes when a remote SMTP client's
              combined DNSBL score is equal to or greater than a threshold (as
              defined with the postscreen_dnsbl_sites and
              postscreen_dnsbl_threshold parameters).

              A mapping from actual DNSBL domain name which includes a secret
              password, to the DNSBL domain name that postscreen will reply with
              when it rejects mail.

       postscreen_dnsbl_sites (empty)
              Optional list of DNS white/blacklist domains, filters and weight
              factors.

       postscreen_dnsbl_threshold (1)

              on its combined DNSBL score as defined with the
              postscreen_dnsbl_sites parameter.

       postscreen_greet_action (ignore)
              The action that postscreen(8) takes when a remote SMTP client
              speaks before its turn within the time specified with the
              postscreen_greet_wait parameter.

       postscreen_greet_banner ($smtpd_banner)
              The text in the optional "220-text..." server response that
              postscreen(8) sends ahead of the real Postfix SMTP server's "220
              text..." response, in an attempt to confuse bad SMTP clients so
              that they speak before their turn (pre-greet).

       postscreen_greet_wait (normal: 6s, overload: 2s)
              The amount of time that postscreen(8) will wait for an SMTP client
              to send a command before its turn, and for DNS blocklist lookup
              results to arrive (default: up to 2 seconds under stress, up to 6
              seconds otherwise).

       smtpd_service_name (smtpd)
              The internal service that postscreen(8) hands off allowed
              connections to.

       Available in Postfix version 2.11 and later:

       postscreen_dnsbl_whitelist_threshold (0)
              Allow a remote SMTP client to skip "before" and "after 220

AFTER 220 GREETING TESTS
       These tests are executed after the remote SMTP client receives the "220
       servername" greeting. If a client passes all tests during this phase, it
       will receive a 4XX response to all RCPT TO commands. After the client
       reconnects, it will be allowed to talk directly to a Postfix SMTP server
       process.

       postscreen_bare_newline_action (ignore)
              The action that postscreen(8) takes when a remote SMTP client
              sends a bare newline character, that is, a newline not preceded by
              carriage return.

       postscreen_bare_newline_enable (no)

              postscreen_forbidden_commands parameter.

       postscreen_non_smtp_command_enable (no)
              Enable "non-SMTP command" tests in the postscreen(8) server.

       postscreen_pipelining_action (enforce)
              The action that postscreen(8) takes when a remote SMTP client
              sends multiple commands instead of sending one command and waiting
              for the server to respond.

       postscreen_pipelining_enable (no)
