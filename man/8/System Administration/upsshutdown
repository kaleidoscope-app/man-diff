UPSSHUTDOWN(8)               System Manager's Manual              UPSSHUTDOWN(8)

NAME
     upsshutdown â€“ UPS emergency low power shutdown script

DESCRIPTION
     upsshutdown is a script that runs automatically when the system performs an
     emergency UPS low power shutdown.  The script is run before shutdown(8) is
     invoked.  upsshutdown only runs if one of the three shutdown rules is
     enabled and true: "percentage remaining," "time remaining," or "time since
     loss of power."  These settings can be changed using pmset(1) or Energy
     Saver in System Preferences.

     The system administrator may modify upsshutdown.  The script should only
     contain commands that must run in the case of an emergency UPS shutdown.
     It should not contain any commands that would otherwise be executed during
     a normal shutdown since the normal shutdown procedure follows invocation of
     upsshutdown.
