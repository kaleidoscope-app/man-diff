NAME
       cupsfilter - convert a file to another format using cups filters
       (deprecated)

SYNOPSIS
       cupsfilter [ --list-filters ] [ -D ] [ -U user ] [ -c config-file ] [ -d
       printer ] [ -e ] [ -i mime/type ] [ -j job-id[,N] ] [ -m mime/type ] [ -n
       copies ] [ -o name=value ] [ -p filename.ppd ] [ -t title ] [ -u ]
       filename

DESCRIPTION
       cupsfilter is a front-end to the CUPS filter subsystem which allows you
       to convert a file to a specific format, just as if you had printed the
       file through CUPS. By default, cupsfilter generates a PDF file. The
       converted file is sent to the standard output.

OPTIONS
       --list-filters
            Do not actually run the filters, just print the filters used to
            stdout.

       -D   Delete the input file after conversion.

       -U user
            Specifies the username passed to the filters. The default is the
            name of the current user.

       -c config-file
            Uses the named cups-files.conf configuration file.

       -d printer
            Uses information from the named printer.

       -e   Use every filter from the PPD file.

       -i mime/type
            Specifies the source file type. The default file type is guessed
            using the filename and contents of the file.

       -j job-id[,N]
            Converts document N from the specified job. If N is omitted,
            document 1 is converted.

       -m mime/type
            Specifies the destination file type. The default file type is
            application/pdf. Use printer/foo to convert to the printer format
            defined by the filters in the PPD file.

       -n copies
            Specifies the number of copies to generate.

       -o name=value
            Specifies options to pass to the CUPS filters.

       -p filename.ppd
            Specifies the PPD file to use.

       -t title
            Specifies the document title.

       -u   Delete the PPD file after conversion.

EXIT STATUS
       cupsfilter returns a non-zero exit status on any error.

ENVIRONMENT
       All of the standard cups(1) environment variables affect the operation of
       cupsfilter.

FILES
       /etc/cups/cups-files.conf
       /etc/cups/*.convs
       /etc/cups/*.types
       /usr/share/cups/mime/*.convs
       /usr/share/cups/mime/*.types

NOTES
       CUPS printer drivers, filters, and backends are deprecated and will no
       longer be supported in a future feature release of CUPS.  Printers that
       do not support IPP can be supported using applications such as
       ippeveprinter(1).

       Unlike when printing, filters run using the cupsfilter command use the
       current user and security session. This may result in different output or
       unexpected behavior.

EXAMPLE
       The following command will generate a PDF preview of job 42 for a printer
       named "myprinter" and save it to a file named "preview.pdf":

           cupsfilter -m application/pdf -d myprinter -j 42 >preview.pdf
