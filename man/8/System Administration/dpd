NAME
     dpd â€“ Display Port daemon.

SYNOPSIS
     dpd

DESCRIPTION
     The dpd executable is a daemon intended to listen for Command + F2 on the
     iMac to switch to external display input mode upon display port hot-plug.
     This feature is known as Target Display Mode. It disables display and idle
     sleep while in external display mode and launches an audio tool called
     dpaudiothru to capture audio input and route it into the mac unit. To go
     back to normal mac mode, unplug the display port or press Command + F2
     again, which will restore all settings.

     dpd should only be run via launchd.
