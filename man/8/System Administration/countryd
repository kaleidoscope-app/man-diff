COUNTRYD(8)                  System Manager's Manual                 COUNTRYD(8)

NAME
     countryd â€“ Listens for country-level information and makes that available
     to users of RegulatoryDomain.framework

SYNOPSIS
     Takes no arguments, and should not be launched manually.

DESCRIPTION
     Receives country code updates from user location, mobile country code (when
     available) and nearby 802.11d wifi access points. This information is then
     stored in a cache and used to compute a country code estimate which
     combines both the on-device code computed from local sensors, and answers
     about which country nearby devices believe they are in.

HISTORY
     countryd first appeared in macOS 13
