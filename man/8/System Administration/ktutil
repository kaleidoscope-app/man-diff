NAME
     ktutil â€“ manage Kerberos keytabs

SYNOPSIS
     ktutil [-k keytab | --keytab=keytab] [-v | --verbose] [--version]
            [-h | --help] command [args]

DESCRIPTION
     ktutil is a program for managing keytabs.  Supported options:

     -v, --verbose
             Verbose output.

     command can be one of the following:

     add [-p principal] [--principal=principal] [-V kvno] [--kvno=kvno] [-e
                 enctype] [--enctype=enctype] [-w password] [--pw-file=filename]
                 [--password=password] [-r] [--random] [-s] [--no-salt] [-H]
                 [--hex]
                 Adds a key to the keytab. Options that are not specified will
                 be prompted for. This requires that you know the password or
                 the hex key of the principal to add; if what you really want is
                 to add a new principal to the keytab, you should consider the
                 get command, which talks to the kadmin server.  --pw-file can
                 specify either a file with a password, or the string STDIN.  In
                 the latter case the password is read from stdin.

     change [-r realm] [--realm=realm] [--a host] [--admin-server=host] [--s
                 port] [--server-port=port]
                 Update one or several keys to new versions.  By default, use
                 the admin server for the realm of a keytab entry.  Otherwise it
                 will use the values specified by the options.

                 If no principals are given, all the ones in the keytab are
                 updated.

     copy [--filter-principal=string]
                 Ar keytab-src Ar keytab-dest Copies all the entries from
                 keytab-src to keytab-dest.  Optionally a princial can be
                 selected as a filter and then just entries matching that
                 principal is copied out.  The matching applies globing rules on
                 each component (eg foo*/host.domain@REALM) is a valid filter
                 principal.

     get [-p admin principal] [--principal=admin principal] [-e enctype]
                 [--enctypes=enctype] [-r realm] [--realm=realm] [-a admin
                 server] [--admin-server=admin server] [-s server port]
                 [--server-port=server port] principal ...
                 For each principal, generate a new key for it (creating it if
                 it doesn't already exist), and put that key in the keytab.

                 If no realm is specified, the realm to operate on is taken from
                 the first principal.

     list [--keys] [--timestamp]
                 List the keys stored in the keytab.

     remove [-p principal] [--principal=principal] [-V -kvno] [--kvno=kvno] [-e
                 -enctype] [--enctype=enctype]
                 Removes the specified key or keys. Not specifying a kvno
                 removes keys with any version number. Not specifying an enctype
                 removes keys of any type.

     rename from-principal to-principal
                 Renames all entries in the keytab that match the from-principal
                 to to-principal.

     purge [--age=age]
                 Removes all old versions of a key for which there is a newer
                 version that is at least age (default one week) old.
