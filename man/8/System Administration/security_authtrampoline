NAME
     security_authtrampoline â€“ Trampoline used by
     AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges from Security.framework.

SYNOPSIS
     security_authtrampoline

DESCRIPTION
     security_authtrampoline is used when programs use
     AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges from Security.framework to run another
     program with root privileges.  The security_authtrampoline command uses the
     authorization infrastructure to determine whether it should proceed.  You
     should not run it by itself.  Execution of other programs is logged with
     syslog(3) to channel LOG_AUTH at LOG_NOTICE level.
