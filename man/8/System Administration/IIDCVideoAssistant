NAME
     IIDCVideoAssistant – CoreMediaIO DAL Assistant Process.

DESCRIPTION
     IIDCVideoAssistant is used by the CoreMediaIO Device Abstraction Layer
     Plug-In that provides video capture from external Apple FireWire (IEEE
     1394) iSight cameras and third-party FireWire IIDC-class cameras using
     AVFoundation Capture APIs.  The process allows multiple applications to
     simultaneously capture from the same camera.
