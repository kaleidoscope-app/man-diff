SLAPACL(8C)                                                          SLAPACL(8C)



NAME
       slapacl - Check access to a list of attributes.

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/slapacl -b_DN [-d_debug-level] [-D_authcDN_| -U_authcID]
       [-f_slapd.conf] [-F_confdir] [-o_option[=value]] [-u] [-v] [-X_authzID_|
       -o  authzDN=DN] [attr[/access][:value]] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       slapacl is used to check the behavior of slapd(8) by verifying access to
       directory data according to the access control list directives defined in
       its configuration.  It opens the slapd.conf(5) configuration file or the
       slapd-config(5) backend, reads in the access/olcAccess directives, and
       then parses the attr list given on the command-line; if none is given,
       access to the entry pseudo-attribute is tested.

OPTIONS
       -b_DN  specify the DN which access is requested to; the corresponding
              entry is fetched from the database, and thus it must exist.  The
              DN is also used to determine what rules apply; thus, it must be in
              the naming context of a configured database.  See also -u.

       -d_debug-level
              enable debugging messages as defined by the specified debug-level;
              see slapd(8) for details.

       -D_authcDN
              specify a DN to be used as identity through the test session when
              selecting appropriate <by> clauses in access lists.

       -f_slapd.conf
              specify an alternative slapd.conf(5) file.

       -F_confdir
              specify a config directory.  If both -f and -F are specified, the
              config file will be read and converted to config directory format
              and written to the specified directory.  If neither option is
              specified, an attempt to read the default config directory will be
              made before trying to use the default config file. If a valid
              config directory exists then the default config file is ignored.

       -o_option[=value]
              Specify an option with a(n optional) value.  Possible generic
              options/values are:

                     syslog=<subsystems>  (see `-s' in slapd(8))
                     syslog-level=<level> (see `-S' in slapd(8))
                     syslog-user=<user>   (see `-l' in slapd(8))

              Possible options/values specific to slapacl are:

                     authzDN
                     domain
                     peername
                     sasl_ssf
                     sockname
                     sockurl
                     ssf
                     tls_ssf
                     transport_ssf

              See the related fields in slapd.access(5) for details.

       -u     do not fetch the entry from the database.  In this case, if the
              entry does not exist, a fake entry with the DN given with the -b
              option is used, with no attributes.  As a consequence, those rules
              that depend on the contents of the target object will not behave
              as with the real object.  The DN given with the -b option is still
              used to select what rules apply; thus, it must be in the naming
              context of a configured database.  See also -b.

       -U_authcID
              specify an ID to be mapped to a DN as by means of authz-regexp or
              authz-rewrite rules (see slapd.conf(5) for details); mutually
              exclusive with -D.

       -v     enable verbose mode.

       -X_authzID
              specify an authorization ID to be mapped to a DN as by means of
              authz-regexp or authz-rewrite rules (see slapd.conf(5) for
              details); mutually exclusive with -o authzDN=DN.

EXAMPLES
       The command

            /usr/sbin/slapacl -f /etc/openldap/slapd.conf -v \
                   -U bjorn -b "o=University of Michigan,c=US" \
                "o/read:University of Michigan"

       tests whether the user bjorn can access the attribute o of the entry
       o=University of Michigan,c=US at read level.
