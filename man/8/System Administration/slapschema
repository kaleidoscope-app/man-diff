SLAPSCHEMA(8C)                                                    SLAPSCHEMA(8C)



NAME
       slapschema - SLAPD in-database schema checking utility

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/slapschema [-afilter] [-bsuffix] [-c] [-ddebug-level]
       [-fslapd.conf] [-Fconfdir] [-g] [-HURI] [-lerror-file] [-ndbnum]
       [-ooption[=value]] [-ssubtree-dn] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       Slapschema is used to check schema compliance of the contents of a
       slapd(8) database.  It opens the given database determined by the
       database number or suffix and checks the compliance of its contents with
       the corresponding schema. Errors are written to standard output or the
       specified file.  Databases configured as subordinate of this one are also
       output, unless -g is specified.

       Administrators may need to modify existing schema items, including adding
       new required attributes to objectClasses, removing existing required or
       allowed attributes from objectClasses, entirely removing objectClasses,
       or any other change that may result in making perfectly valid entries no
       longer compliant with the modified schema.  The execution of the
       slapschema tool after modifying the schema can point out inconsistencies
       that would otherwise surface only when inconsistent entries need to be
       modified.


       The entry records are checked in database order, not superior first
       order.  The entry records will be checked considering all (user and
       operational) attributes stored in the database.  Dynamically generated
       attributes (such as subschemaSubentry) will not be considered.

OPTIONS
       -a_filter
              Only check entries matching the asserted filter.  For example

              slapschema -a \
                  "(!(entryDN:dnSubtreeMatch:=ou=People,dc=example,dc=com))"

              will check all but the "ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" subtree of
              the "dc=example,dc=com" database.  Deprecated; use -H
              ldap:///???(filter) instead.

       -b_suffix
              Use the specified suffix to determine which database to check.
              The -b cannot be used in conjunction with the -n option.

       -c     Enable continue (ignore errors) mode.

       -d_debug-level
              Enable debugging messages as defined by the specified debug-level;
              see slapd(8) for details.

       -f_slapd.conf
              Specify an alternative slapd.conf(5) file.

       -F_confdir
              specify a config directory.  If both -f and -F are specified, the
              config file will be read and converted to config directory format
              and written to the specified directory.  If neither option is
              specified, an attempt to read the default config directory will be
              made before trying to use the default config file. If a valid
              config directory exists then the default config file is ignored.

       -g     disable subordinate gluing.  Only the specified database will be
              processed, and not its glued subordinates (if any).

       -H  URI
              use dn, scope and filter from URI to only handle matching entries.

       -l_error-file
              Write errors to specified file instead of standard output.

       -n_dbnum
              Check the dbnum-th database listed in the configuration file. The
              config database slapd-config(5), is always the first database, so
              use -n 0

              The -n cannot be used in conjunction with the -b option.

       -o_option[=value]
              Specify an option with a(n optional) value.  Possible generic
              options/values are:

                     syslog=<subsystems>  (see `-s' in slapd(8))
                     syslog-level=<level> (see `-S' in slapd(8))
                     syslog-user=<user>   (see `-l' in slapd(8))


       -s_subtree-dn
              Only check entries in the subtree specified by this DN.  Implies
              -b subtree-dn if no -b nor -n option is given.  Deprecated; use -H
              ldap:///subtree-dn instead.

       -v     Enable verbose mode.

LIMITATIONS
       For some backend types, your slapd(8) should not be running (at least,
       not in read-write mode) when you do this to ensure consistency of the
       database. It is always safe to run slapschema with the slapd-bdb(5),
       slapd-hdb(5), and slapd-null(5) backends.

EXAMPLES
       To check the schema compliance of your SLAPD database after modifications
       to the schema, and put any error in a file called errors.ldif, give the
       command:

            /usr/sbin/slapcat -l errors.ldif
