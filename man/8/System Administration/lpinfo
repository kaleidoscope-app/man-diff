       The first form (-m) lists the available drivers, while the second form
       (-v) lists the available devices.

       -E   Forces encryption when connecting to the server.

       -h server[:port]
            Selects an alternate server.

       -l   Shows a "long" listing of devices or drivers.

       --exclude-schemes scheme-list
            Specifies a comma-delimited list of device or PPD schemes that

       --include-schemes scheme-list
            Specifies a comma-delimited list of device or PPD schemes that
            should be included in the results.  Static PPD files use the "file"

            option.

            Specifies the product to match when listing drivers with the -m
            option.

       --timeout seconds
