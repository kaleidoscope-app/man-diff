NAME
     containermanagerd – Application and plug-in containerization management
     daemon

SYNOPSIS
     containermanagerd [--runmode runmode] [--default-user username]
                       [--bundle-container-mode mode]
                       [--bundle-container-owner username]
                       [--system-container-mode mode]

DESCRIPTION
     containermanagerd creates, destroys, and otherwise manages containers for
     applications and their respective plug-ins and works in concert with
     sandbox(7) to provide application containerization. It is a classic launch
     daemon and/or agent managed by launchd.

     The following arguments are available:

     --runmode runmode
             Defines the running mode of the daemon where runmode is one of the
             following:

             exclusive      The daemon will run in exclusive mode where all
                            containers on the system are managed by a single
                            containermanagerd process.  This is the default
                            runmode. This mode can only be run as a
                            LaunchDaemon.

             agent          The daemon will run in per-user mode, and will
                            manage containers only for the current user.

             proxy          The daemon will run in per-user mode, but will only
                            forward messages to the LaunchDaemon. This mode will
                            automatically be used if set to run as an agent but
                            the current user has no home directory, or its home
                            directory is /var/empty.

     --default-user username
             Sets the default user where user data will be stored.

     --bundle-container-mode mode
             Controls how bundle containers are managed where mode is one of the
             following:

             none          Bundle containers will not be supported.

             global        Bundle containers will be cross-user and owned by the
                           system.

             per-user      Bundle containers will be per-user and owned by the
                           user.

     --bundle-container-owner username
             Sets the username that bundle containers will be chown(2) to.
             Ignored if bundle container mode is not global

     --system-container-mode mode
             Controls how system containers are managed where mode is one of the
             following:

             none          System containers will not be supported.

             global        System containers will be cross-user and owned by the
                           system.

             per-user      System containers will be per-user and owned by the
                           user.

     --system-container-owner username
             Sets the username that system containers will be chown(2) to.
             Ignored if system container mode is not global

     Users should not run containermanagerd manually and changing arguments is
     unsupported.
