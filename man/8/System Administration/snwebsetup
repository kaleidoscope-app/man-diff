SNWEBSETUP(8)                System Manager's Manual               SNWEBSETUP(8)



NAME
       WebService setup for Storage Manager file operations

SYNOPSIS
       snwebsetup [-h] [-u USER] [-p PASSWORD] -s SERVER_URI dirs [dirs ...]

DESCRIPTION
       snwebsetup creates configuration files in Managed StorNext file systems
       which can be used by the snretrieve, snstore, sntruncate, snfileinfo and
       snjobinfo commands as well as other services.  Each listed directory has
       a file called .StorNext_rest.json created in it.  This command should be
       run on the MDC as it needs access to the local mount point information.

       For StorNext client access, the file is expected at the root of a file
       system.  For use with NAS access, the file is expected at the exported
       root of the share.

       Prior to running this command, web services should be enabled and an
       account created which has access to web services.  The user name and
       password for this account are used as input to the snwebsetup command.
