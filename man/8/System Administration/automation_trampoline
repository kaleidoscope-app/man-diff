AUTOMATION_TRAMPOLINE(8)     System Manager's Manual    AUTOMATION_TRAMPOLINE(8)

NAME
     automation_trampoline â€“ runs automation on boot

DESCRIPTION
     The automation_trampoline daemon runs automation on boot, or when invoked
     manually.

     By default, automation_trampoline is disallowed.  In order to run
     automation, one of the following conditions must be satisfied:

     -   The system is netbooted (kern.netboot=1).

     -   The system allows automation (kern.bootargs contains
         com.apple.automation=1).

     automation_trampoline is not intended for general use, and its behavior is
     not documented. Use launchd(8) instead.
