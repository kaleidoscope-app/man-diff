       httpd [ -k install|config|uninstall ] [ -n name ] [ -w ]



SUMMARY
       httpd is the Apache HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server program. It
       is designed to be run as a standalone daemon process. When used like this
       it will create a pool of child processes or threads to handle requests.


       In general, httpd should not be invoked directly, but rather should be
       invoked via apachectl on Unix-based systems or as a service on Windows
       NT, 2000 and XP and as a console application on Windows 9x and ME.



OPTIONS
       -d serverroot
              Set the initial value for the ServerRoot directive to serverroot.
              This can be overridden by the ServerRoot directive in the
              configuration file. The default is /usr.

       -f config
              Uses the directives in the file config on startup. If config does
              not begin with a /, then it is taken to be a path relative to the
              ServerRoot. The default is /etc/apache2/httpd.conf.

       -k start|restart|graceful|stop|graceful-stop
              Signals httpd to start, restart, or stop. See Stopping Apache
              httpd for more information.

       -C directive
              Process the configuration directive before reading config files.

       -c directive
              Process the configuration directive after reading config files.

       -D parameter
              Sets a configuration parameter which can be used with <IfDefine>
              sections in the configuration files to conditionally skip or
              process commands at server startup and restart. Also can be used
              to set certain less-common startup parameters including
              -DNO_DETACH (prevent the parent from forking) and -DFOREGROUND
              (prevent the parent from calling setsid() et al).

       -e level
              Sets the LogLevel to level during server startup. This is useful
              for temporarily increasing the verbosity of the error messages to
              find problems during startup.

       -E file
              Send error messages during server startup to file.

       -h     Output a short summary of available command line options.

       -l     Output a list of modules compiled into the server. This will not
              list dynamically loaded modules included using the LoadModule
              directive.

       -L     Output a list of directives provided by static modules, together
              with expected arguments and places where the directive is valid.
              Directives provided by shared modules are not listed.

       -M     Dump a list of loaded Static and Shared Modules.

       -S     Show the settings as parsed from the config file (currently only
              shows the virtualhost settings).

       -T (Available in 2.3.8 and later)
              Skip document root check at startup/restart.

       -t     Run syntax tests for configuration files only. The program
              immediately exits after these syntax parsing tests with either a
              return code of 0 (Syntax OK) or return code not equal to 0 (Syntax
              Error). If -D DUMP_VHOSTS is also set, details of the virtual host
              configuration will be printed. If -D DUMP_MODULES  is set, all
              loaded modules will be printed.

       -v     Print the version of httpd, and then exit.

       -V     Print the version and build parameters of httpd, and then exit.

       -X     Run httpd in debug mode. Only one worker will be started and the
              server will not detach from the console.


       The following arguments are available only on the Windows platform:



       -k install|config|uninstall
              Install Apache httpd as a Windows NT service; change startup
              options for the Apache httpd service; and uninstall the Apache
              httpd service.

       -n name
              The name of the Apache httpd service to signal.

       -w     Keep the console window open on error so that the error message
              can be read.
