SYSTEMKEYCHAIN(8)            System Manager's Manual           SYSTEMKEYCHAIN(8)

NAME
     systemkeychain â€“ creates system keychains and allows keychains to unlock
     keychains

SYNOPSIS
     systemkeychain [-fv] [-k filename] [-C] [password]
     systemkeychain [-fvc] [-k filename] [-s] [file ...]
     systemkeychain [-v] [-k filename] [-t]

DESCRIPTION
     The systemkeychain can be used to create a system keychain, make it
     possible for a keychain to unlock another keychain, or test unlocking a
     keychain.

     The options are as follows:

     -C      Create a keychain and establish it in the system as the primary
             system keychain whose unlocking is automatically handled by the
             system. The new keychain is empty. If the optional password
             argument is given, the keychain can be also be unlocked with that;
             otherwise, the keychain has no password and can only be unlocked by
             the system.  The optional password option is generally used for
             testing purposes, and using it is not recommended.

     -s      Extract the master secret from source keychain(s) and install them
             in a destination keychain to allow unlocking.

     -t      Test unlocking the system keychain.

     -k systemKeychain
             Use a keychain other than the default as the destination system
             keychain.

     -c      Create the target keychain if necessary.

     -f      Force creation of a system keychain or overwriting of an existing
             key for keychain unlocking keychain operations.

     -v      Turn on verbose mode.

     By default, systemkeychain works with the keychain file stored at
     /Library/Keychains/System.keychain .  Use of the -k option can specify a
     different target file.

     Use of the -s option allows keychains to be setup to unlock other
     keychains.  Chains of keychain unlocks can be setup in this manner to make
     a series of keychains unlock while only needing to manually unlock the
     first one.  This functionality can be verified with the -t (test unlock)
     option.

FILES
