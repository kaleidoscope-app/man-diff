NAME
       suexec - Switch user before executing external programs


SYNOPSIS
       suexec -V



SUMMARY
       suexec is used by the Apache HTTP Server to switch to another user before
       executing CGI programs. In order to achieve this, it must run as root.
       Since the HTTP daemon normally doesn't run as root, the suexec executable
       needs the setuid bit set and must be owned by root. It should never be
       writable for any other person than root.


       For further information about the concepts and the security model of
       suexec please refer to the suexec documentation
       (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/suexec.html).



OPTIONS
       -V     If you are root, this option displays the compile options of
              suexec. For security reasons all configuration options are
              changeable only at compile time.
