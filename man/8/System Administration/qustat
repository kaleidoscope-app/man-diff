       Object Identifiers

       -c, --csv file     Specify a .csv file to load
       -h, --host opt     Host name or IP address
       -m, --module opt   Module name
       -g, --group opt    Group name
       -t, --table opt    Table Number

       Statistics are identified by a group and module name.  Example
       group,module identifiers are FS_name,FSM; kernel,client; FSMPM,FSMPM.
       The default module name is FSM.  If the module name is unique, the group
       name may be optional.

       Formatting

       -F, --format all        Show all records (including zeros)
       -F, --format csv        Output in .csv format
       -F, --format xml        Output in XML format (with -D only)
       -F, --format graphite   Output graphite format data
       -F, --format protobuf   Output protobuf format data (with -A only)

COMMANDS
       -P, --print
              This is the default command if no other commands are specified.
              To use the print command, you must also supply a group (file
              system) name with the -g option.

              The print command fetches the statistics table(s) from the
              specified group (e.g. the FSM) and prints them to standard output.
              The output is described below.

       -T, --time_hourly
              Hourly statistics are kept and written to CSV files.  This prints
              the hourly statistics.  To use the print command, you must also
              supply a group (file system) name with the -g option.

       -I, --interval
              The interval command controls the rate at which statistics are
              forwarded from running processes to the snstatd process.  The
              interval parameter is in seconds.  The value must be -1 (turn off)
              or between 5 and 2147483 inclusive.

       -A, --archive
              The archive command specifies the location that the snstatd
              process should periodically send statistics to.  The target is in
              terms of a hostname and tcp port number. A TCP/IP connection is
              opened ever interval seconds and any new statistics are send in
              graphite format down the connection. The connection is then
              closed.  Use -F with this command to switch between graphite and
              protobuf output.

       -R, --reset

              WARNING! Resetting statistics affects hourly reports and anybody
                       else using qustats, including connect.  Note:  Using the
              -R and -P option together is not atomic.  First the current values
              are collected and then the reset command is processed.  Any
              statistics updated between the collection and reset are lost.

              This command resets the internal statistics tables for the
              specified Object Identifier.

       -M, --minmax

              WARNING! Resetting minimum and maximum affects the hourly report
              for that time period.

              This command resets the internal statistics tables for the
              specified Object Identifier.


       -S, --selftest
              Runs self-test to verify that internal functions are working
              properly.  If your system is busy, it may be normal for the timing
              tests to fail.

       -V, --version
              Display version information for the qustat command.

       -D, --description
              Use the -D command to find the description for tables and stats.
              The -D search string may contain the wildcard '*'.  Note that
              strings with an asterisk should be quoted to avoid globbing.  You
              must provide object identifiers for at least one table.

              Search Examples:

                  qustat -g myFileSys -D "*"
                  qustat -g myFileSys -D "VOP Lookup"
                  qustat -g myFileSys -t 1 -D "VOP Lookup"
                  qustat -g myFileSys -t 1 -D "VOP *"
                  qustat -g myFileSys -t 1 -D "*"


       -H, --help
              Displays help information.

OBJECT IDENTIFIERS
       -c csv_file, --csv csv_file
              Specify a .csv file to load.

       -h host, --host host
              The host or IP address where the Module (e.g. FSM) is located.
              This option is normally not needed when displaying FSM statistics
              if your computer is joined to the cluster.

       -m module, --module module
              Specifies the module (process or service) from which to extract
              statistics.  The module specifier all can be used to select all
              types of modules.

              The default module is FSM if not specified.

       -g group, --group group
              Identifies the group of tables.  For FSM modules, the group
              specifies the file system name.

              This is the same as the -f option.

       -t table_number, --table table_number
              Use -t to print a single table.  If you print all statistics, the
              table numbers are displayed in the table header.  See TABLES
              below.

              If you do not specify a table, all tables for the group are
              displayed.

       -f file_system, --fs file_system
              This is the same as the -g option.

FORMATTING
       -F option, --format option
              You may specify the -F option multiple times. The all option will
              print all statistics including those with all zero values.  The
              csv option will display output in comma-separated-values format.
              The xml option will display output in XML format.

OUTPUT
       The Group header includes revision, host, module, group and time
       recorded.  The time_t value is the output of the time(2) function call.

       Columns include:

       NAME      The name of the statistic being gathered.
       TYP       The type of statistic.
       CNT       The number of times something occurred.
       LVL       The current level of something (e.g. number of free buffers).
       SUM       The accumulated sum such as the amount of data written.
       TIM       The amount of time consumed (in microseconds).
       COUNT     Number of times the operation was performed.
       MIN/MAX   Minimum and maximum values.
       TOT/LVL   Total or current level (depending on TYP)
       AVG       The average (TOT divided by COUNT)

TABLES
       A Group is normally split into multiple tables. Each table is identified
       by a unique table number.

       Table numbers are guaranteed to identify a single unique object
       throughout the lifespan of the given group, but not across
       reboots/restarts for the group.

       For the FSM, the main table numbers will remain consistent across
       restarts, but the per-client statistics will vary depending on connection
       order.

ACCURACY
       Statistics are not guaranteed to be 100% accurate.

       For performance reasons, the implementation does not explicitly lock the
       code when gathering statistics.  However most operations are already
       protected by other multi-thread locking and therefore inaccuracies should
       be minimal.

       In addition, operations are not halted or locked when resetting or
       gathering statistics.  It is possible to have a statistic dropped during
       a reset or snap of statistics.

CVLOG HOURLY STATISTICS DUMPS
       In prior releases, the FSM dumped statistics on an hourly basis to the
       cvlogs which were located under the data directory. These statistics
       dumps have been moved to a separate directory called qustats.  The format
       has also been changed to .csv files which can be opened in most
       spreadsheets and databases. They can also be easily parsed by most
       programming languages and utilities.

EXAMPLES
    Print the FSM statistics for file system snfs1.

       rock # qustat -g xsan1

    Print the kernel client statistics.

       rock # qustat -g kernel -m client

    Print the statistic for the client table 2 statistics.

       rock # qustat -m client -t 2

    Print the statistic descriptions for client definitions.

       rock # qustat -g kernel -m client -D "*"

    Print the statistic descriptions for client definitions.

       rock # qustat -g FSMPM -m FSMPM -D "*"

    Print the statistic descriptions for the fsm VOP statistics

       rock # qustat -g xsan1 -D "VOP"
