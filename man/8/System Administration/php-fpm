PHP-FPM(8)                     Scripting Language                     PHP-FPM(8)



NAME
       php-fpm - PHP FastCGI Process Manager 'PHP-FPM'

SYNOPSIS
       php-fpm [options]

DESCRIPTION
       PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is
       especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML. This
       is a variant of PHP that will run in the background as a daemon,
       listening for CGI requests. Output is logged to /usr/var/log/php-fpm.log.

       Most options are set in the configuration file. The configuration file is
       /private/etc/php-fpm.conf. By default, php-fpm will respond to CGI
       requests listening on localhost http port 9000. Therefore php-fpm expects
       your webserver to forward all requests for '.php' files to port 9000 and
       you should edit your webserver configuration file appropriately.

       --force-stderr
       -O             Force output to stderr in nodaemonize even if stderr is
                      not a TTY.

       --allow-to-run-as-root
       -R             Allow pool to run as root (disabled by default)

FILES
       php-fpm.conf   The configuration file for the php-fpm daemon.

       php.ini        The standard php configuration file.

EXAMPLES
       For any unix systems which use init.d for their main process manager, you
       should use the init script provided to start and stop the php-fpm daemon.

              sudo /etc/init.d/php-fpm start

       For any unix systems which use systemd for their main process manager,
       you should use the unit file provided to start and stop the php-fpm
       daemon.

              sudo systemctl start php-fpm.service

       If your installation has no appropriate init script, launch php-fpm with
       no arguments. It will launch as a daemon (background process) by default.
       The file /usr/var/run/php-fpm.pid determines whether php-fpm is already
       up and running. Once started, php-fpm then responds to several POSIX
       signals:

              SIGINT,SIGTERM      immediate termination
              SIGQUIT             graceful stop
              SIGUSR1             re-open log file
              SIGUSR2             graceful reload of all workers + reload of fpm
              conf/binary

TIPS
       The PHP-FPM CGI daemon will work well with most popular webservers,
       including Apache2, lighttpd and nginx.
