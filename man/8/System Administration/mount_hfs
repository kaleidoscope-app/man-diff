MOUNT_HFS(8)                 System Manager's Manual                MOUNT_HFS(8)

NAME
     mount_hfs â€“ mount an HFS+ file system

SYNOPSIS
     mount_hfs [-e encoding] [-u user] [-g group] [-m mask] [-o options] [-j]
               [-c] [-w] [-x] special directory

DESCRIPTION
     The mount_hfs command attaches the HFS file system residing on the device
     special to the global file system namespace at the location indicated by
     directory.  This command is normally executed by mount(8) at boot time.

     The options are as follows:

     -u user
             Set the owner of the files in the file system to user.  The default
             owner is the owner of the directory on which the file system is
             being mounted.  The user may be a user-name, or a numeric value.

     -g group
             Set the group of the files in the file system to group.  The
             default group is the group of the directory on which the file
             system is being mounted.  The group may be a group-name, or a
             numeric value.

     -m mask
             Specify the maximum file permissions for files in the file system.
             (For example, a mask of 755 specifies that, by default, the owner
             should have read, write, and execute permissions for files, but
             others should only have read and execute permissions.  See chmod(1)
             for more information about octal file modes.)  Only the nine low-
             order bits of mask are used.  The default mask is taken from the
             directory on which the file system is being mounted.

     -o      Options are specified with a -o flag followed by a comma separated
             string of options.  See the mount(8) man page for possible options
             and their meanings.

     -j      Ignore the journal for this mount.

     -c      Disable group commit for journaling.

BUGS
     Some HFS file systems with highly fragmented catalog files may not mount.

HISTORY
     The mount_hfs utility first appeared in Mac OS X Server 1.0.  As of Mac OS
     X 10.15, this utility will no longer mount HFS standard file systems.
