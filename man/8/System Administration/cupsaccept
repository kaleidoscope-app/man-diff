NAME
       cupsaccept/cupsreject - accept/reject jobs sent to a destination

SYNOPSIS
       cupsaccept [ -E ] [ -U username ] [ -h hostname[:port] ] destination(s)
       cupsreject [ -E ] [ -U username ] [ -h hostname[:port] ] [ -r reason ]
       destination(s)

DESCRIPTION
       The cupsaccept command instructs the printing system to accept print jobs
       to the specified destinations.

       The cupsreject command instructs the printing system to reject print jobs
       to the specified destinations.  The -r option sets the reason for
       rejecting print jobs. If not specified, the reason defaults to "Reason
       Unknown".

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported by both cupsaccept and cupsreject:

       -E   Forces encryption when connecting to the server.

       -U username
            Sets the username that is sent when connecting to the server.

       -h hostname[:port]
            Chooses an alternate server.

       -r "reason"
            Sets the reason string that is shown for a printer that is rejecting
            jobs.

CONFORMING TO
       The cupsaccept and cupsreject commands correspond to the System V
       printing system commands "accept" and "reject", respectively.  Unlike the
       System V printing system, CUPS allows printer names to contain any
       printable character except SPACE, TAB, "/", or "#".  Also, printer and
       class names are not case-sensitive.

       Finally, the CUPS versions may ask the user for an access password
       depending on the printing system configuration.
