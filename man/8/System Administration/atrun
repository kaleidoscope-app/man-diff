ATRUN(8)                     System Manager's Manual                    ATRUN(8)

NAME
     atrun – run jobs queued for later execution

SYNOPSIS
     atrun

DESCRIPTION
     The atrun utility runs commands queued by at(1).  It is invoked
     periodically by launchd(8) as specified in the com.apple.atrun.plist
     property list.  By default the property list contains the Disabled key set
     to true, so atrun is never invoked.

     Execute the following command as root to enable atrun:
           launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.atrun.plist

FILES
     /var/at/jobs      Directory containing job files
     /var/at/spool     Directory containing output spool files
     /var/at/lockfile  Job-creation lock file.

SEE ALSO
     at(1), launchd(8)
