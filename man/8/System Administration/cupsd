NAME
       cupsd - cups scheduler

SYNOPSIS
       cupsd [ -c cupsd.conf ] [ -f ] [ -F ] [ -h ] [ -l ] [ -s cups-files.conf
       ] [ -t ]

DESCRIPTION
       cupsd is the scheduler for CUPS. It implements a printing system based
       upon the Internet Printing Protocol, version 2.1, and supports most of
       the requirements for IPP Everywhere. If no options are specified on the
       command-line then the default configuration file /etc/cups/cupsd.conf
       will be used.

OPTIONS
       -c_cupsd.conf
            Uses the named cupsd.conf configuration file.

       -f   Run cupsd in the foreground; the default is to run in the background
            as a "daemon".

       -F   Run cupsd in the foreground but detach the process from the
            controlling terminal and current directory. This is useful for
            running cupsd from init(8).

       -h   Shows the program usage.

       -l   This option is passed to cupsd when it is run from launchd(8) or
            systemd(8).

       -s_cups-files.conf
            Uses the named cups-files.conf configuration file.

       -t   Test the configuration file for syntax errors.

FILES
       /etc/cups/classes.conf
       /etc/cups/cups-files.conf
       /etc/cups/cupsd.conf
       /usr/share/cups/mime/mime.convs
       /usr/share/cups/mime/mime.types
       /etc/cups/printers.conf
       /etc/cups/subscriptions.conf

CONFORMING TO
       cupsd implements all of the required IPP/2.1 attributes and operations.
       It also implements several CUPS-specific administrative operations.

EXAMPLES
       Run cupsd in the background with the default configuration file:

           cupsd

       Test a configuration file called test.conf:

           cupsd -t -c test.conf

       Run cupsd in the foreground with a test configuration file called
       test.conf:

           cupsd -f -c test.conf
