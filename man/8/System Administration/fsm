FSM(8)                       System Manager's Manual                      FSM(8)



NAME
       fsm - Xsan File System Manager

SYNOPSIS
       fsm [volume_name [cluster_admin]_[host_name]]

DESCRIPTION
       The fsm is the server daemon that manages a Xsan Volume The File System
       Manager (FSM) manages the volume's name space, allocations, and metadata
       coherency. It is also used for I/O bandwidth and storage pool management
       functions. The default Xsan volume name is default, and the default host
       name is the system's hostname as found by the gethostname(2) library
       call.

       The optional cluster_admin argument has the syntax:

              @cluster_name/admin_domain

       The @ distinguishes the cluster_admin argument from the host_name
       argument.

       Multiple FSM processes may co-exist on one system, as long as they have
       unique volume names. The volume name is used by the mount(8) command,
       along with the hostname separated by a colon (:). For example, if an FSM
       process was started on host fsmhost and the volume name was declared
       projecta and the mount point was /usr/clips, then the mount command would
       be:

           mount -t acfs fsmhost:projecta /usr/clips

       This process runs in the background and is started at boot time. It is
       enabled or disabled via chkconfig(8) or init.d(7) using the cvfs key
       word.

       To start multiple FSM daemons (therefore multiple volumes) on a single
       system the fsmlist file must be created to describe which FSM daemons to
       start. See fsmpm(8) and fsmlist(4) for details.

ENVIRONMENT
       FSM_KEEP_ALIVE_TIME
              This variable can be used to change the rate that the FSM process
              sends a keep alive message to each connected client.  The value is
              in seconds, with a default of 5 seconds.  It can be set between 1
              and 7200 seconds (2 hours).

              Note:  This variable is not intended for general use, and should
                     only be used when recommended by Apple Support.

       FSM_KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT
              This variable can be used to change the timeout value that the FSM
              process uses after sending a keep alive to a client.  The value is
              in seconds, with a default of 3 seconds.  It can be set between 1
              and 30 seconds.  Note that there are other factors that are also
              considered by the FSM process before timing out a client, so the
              actual timeout may be somewhat longer.

              Note:  This variable is not intended for general use, and should
                     only be used when recommended by Apple Support.
