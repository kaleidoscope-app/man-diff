APFS_UNLOCKFV(8)             System Manager's Manual            APFS_UNLOCKFV(8)

NAME
     apfs_unlockfv â€“ unlock an APFS FileVault data volume

SYNOPSIS
     apfs_unlockfv [-h]
     apfs_unlockfv [-W] [path]

DESCRIPTION
     The apfs_unlockfv utility unlocks an APFS-formatted FileVault-encrypted
     data volume.

     The path parameter is optional, but if provided should be a path on a
     mounted APFS System volume.  (This volume must have the System role, and
     must be in a volume group with a locked Data volume.)  If path is not
     provided, apfs_unlockfv will attempt to unlock the data volume paired to
     the system volume at / .

     Upon invocation, apfs_unlockfv will prompt the user for a password.  This
     password can be for any user on the volume being unlocked, including the
     Disk user.

     The options are as follows:

           -h      Print a usage message.

           -W      Unlock with empty password.

EXIT STATUS
     apfs_unlockfv exits with 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.  If the
     volume was already unlocked, apfs_unlockfv also exits with 0.
