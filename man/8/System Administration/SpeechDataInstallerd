SpeechDataInstallerd(8)      System Manager's Manual     SpeechDataInstallerd(8)

NAME
     SpeechDataInstallerd â€“ Manages downloading of speech-related assets.

DESCRIPTION
     SpeechDataInstallerd is a background process that normally runs only when
     speech-related assets are actively being downloaded. The process manages a
     queue of download requests that are serialized to the underlying Software
     Update SPI, allowing the Speech and Dictation preference panes to present
     appropriate progress UI and error alerts. The process is also scheduled to
     run once a week to  remove any purged assets, such as voices that have been
     marked by a client as no longer needed.
