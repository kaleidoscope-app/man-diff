VIRTUAL(8)                   System Manager's Manual                  VIRTUAL(8)




NAME
       virtual - Postfix virtual domain mail delivery agent

SYNOPSIS
       virtual [generic Postfix daemon options]

DESCRIPTION
       The virtual(8) delivery agent is designed for virtual mail hosting
       services. Originally based on the Postfix local(8) delivery agent, this
       agent looks up recipients with map lookups of their full recipient
       address, instead of using hard-coded unix password file lookups of the
       address local part only.

       This delivery agent only delivers mail.  Other features such as mail
       forwarding, out-of-office notifications, etc., must be configured via
       virtual_alias maps or via similar lookup mechanisms.

MAILBOX LOCATION
       The mailbox location is controlled by the virtual_mailbox_base and
       virtual_mailbox_maps configuration parameters (see below).  The
       virtual_mailbox_maps table is indexed by the recipient address as
       described under TABLE SEARCH ORDER below.

       The mailbox pathname is constructed as follows:

         $virtual_mailbox_base/$virtual_mailbox_maps(recipient)

       where recipient is the full recipient address.

UNIX MAILBOX FORMAT
       When the mailbox location does not end in /, the message is delivered in
       UNIX mailbox format.   This format stores multiple messages in one
       textfile.

       The virtual(8) delivery agent prepends a "From sender time_stamp"
       envelope header to each message, prepends a Delivered-To: message header
       with the envelope recipient address, prepends an X-Original-To: header
       with the recipient address as given to Postfix, prepends a Return-Path:
       message header with the envelope sender address, prepends a > character
       to lines beginning with "From ", and appends an empty line.

       The mailbox is locked for exclusive access while delivery is in progress.
       In case of problems, an attempt is made to truncate the mailbox to its
       original length.

QMAIL MAILDIR FORMAT
       When the mailbox location ends in /, the message is delivered in qmail
       maildir format. This format stores one message per file.

       The virtual(8) delivery agent prepends a Delivered-To: message header
       with the final envelope recipient address, prepends an X-Original-To:
       header with the recipient address as given to Postfix, and prepends a
       Return-Path: message header with the envelope sender address.

       By definition, maildir format does not require application-level file
       locking during mail delivery or retrieval.

MAILBOX OWNERSHIP
       Mailbox ownership is controlled by the virtual_uid_maps and
       virtual_gid_maps lookup tables, which are indexed with the full recipient
       address. Each table provides a string with the numerical user and group
       ID, respectively.

       The virtual_minimum_uid parameter imposes a lower bound on numerical user
       ID values that may be specified in any virtual_uid_maps.

CASE FOLDING
       All delivery decisions are made using the full recipient address, folded
       to lower case. See also the next section for a few exceptions with
       optional address extensions.

TABLE SEARCH ORDER
       Normally, a lookup table is specified as a text file that serves as input
       to the postmap(1) command. The result, an indexed file in dbm or db
       format, is used for fast searching by the mail system.

       The search order is as follows. The search stops upon the first
       successful lookup.

       •      When the recipient has an optional address extension the
              user+extension@domain.tld address is looked up first.

              With Postfix versions before 2.1, the optional address extension
              is always ignored.

       •      The user@domain.tld address, without address extension, is looked
              up next.

       •      Finally, the recipient @domain is looked up.

       When the table is provided via other means such as NIS, LDAP or SQL, the
       same lookups are done as for ordinary indexed files.

       Alternatively, a table can be provided as a regular-expression map where
       patterns are given as regular expressions. In that case, only the full
       recipient address is given to the regular-expression map.

SECURITY
       The virtual(8) delivery agent is not security sensitive, provided that
       the lookup tables with recipient user/group ID information are adequately
       protected. This program is not designed to run chrooted.

       The virtual(8) delivery agent disallows regular expression substitution
       of $1 etc. in regular expression lookup tables, because that would open a
       security hole.

       The virtual(8) delivery agent will silently ignore requests to use the
       proxymap(8) server. Instead it will open the table directly. Before
       Postfix version 2.2, the virtual delivery agent will terminate with a
       fatal error.

STANDARDS
       RFC 822 (ARPA Internet Text Messages)

DIAGNOSTICS
       Mail bounces when the recipient has no mailbox or when the recipient is
       over disk quota. In all other cases, mail for an existing recipient is
       deferred and a warning is logged.

       Problems and transactions are logged to syslogd(8).  Corrupted message
       files are marked so that the queue manager can move them to the corrupt
       queue afterwards.

       Depending on the setting of the notify_classes parameter, the postmaster
       is notified of bounces and of other trouble.

BUGS
       This delivery agent supports address extensions in email addresses and in
       lookup table keys, but does not propagate address extension information
       to the result of table lookup.

       Postfix should have lookup tables that can return multiple result
       attributes. In order to avoid the inconvenience of maintaining three
       tables, use an LDAP or MYSQL database.

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
       Changes to main.cf are picked up automatically, as virtual(8) processes
       run for only a limited amount of time. Use the command "postfix reload"
       to speed up a change.

       The text below provides only a parameter summary. See postconf(5) for
       more details including examples.

HISTORY
       This delivery agent was originally based on the Postfix local delivery
       agent. Modifications mainly consisted of removing code that either was
       not applicable or that was not safe in this context: aliases,
       ~user/.forward files, delivery to "|command" or to /file/name.

       The Delivered-To: message header appears in the qmail system by Daniel
       Bernstein.

       The maildir structure appears in the qmail system by Daniel Bernstein.
