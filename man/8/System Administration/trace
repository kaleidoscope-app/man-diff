BOUNCE(8)                    System Manager's Manual                   BOUNCE(8)




NAME
       bounce - Postfix delivery status reports

SYNOPSIS
       bounce [generic Postfix daemon options]

DESCRIPTION
       The bounce(8) daemon maintains per-message log files with delivery status
       information. Each log file is named after the queue file that it
       corresponds to, and is kept in a queue subdirectory named after the
       service name in the master.cf file (either bounce, defer or trace).  This
       program expects to be run from the master(8) process manager.

       The bounce(8) daemon processes two types of service requests:

       •      Append a recipient (non-)delivery status record to a per-message
              log file.

       •      Enqueue a delivery status notification message, with a copy of a
              per-message log file and of the corresponding message.  When the
              delivery status notification message is enqueued successfully, the
              per-message log file is deleted.

       The software does a best notification effort. A non-delivery notification
       is sent even when the log file or the original message cannot be read.

       Optionally, a bounce (defer, trace) client can request that the
       per-message log file be deleted when the requested operation fails.  This
       is used by clients that cannot retry transactions by themselves, and that
       depend on retry logic in their own client.

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
       Changes to main.cf are picked up automatically, as bounce(8) processes
       run for only a limited amount of time. Use the command "postfix reload"
       to speed up a change.
