diagnosticd(8)               System Manager's Manual              diagnosticd(8)

NAME
     diagnosticd â€“ unified logging system diagnostic daemon

DESCRIPTION
     diagnosticd is part of the unified logging system.  It helps serve live
     debugging information.  For example, it manages and delivers data to
     Console.app and the log(1) utility's stream command.

           { process }
                `--- os_log ---> ... { logd } ...
                          \
                           `---> { diagnosticd } ---> { Console.app }
                                                 `---> { log stream }

     Note that, when Console.app or log stream are actively displaying ongoing
     system data, diagnosticd and os_log(3) calls require extra system resources
     (e.g., CPU) to serve this data live.
