NAME
       sncfgedit - Edit Xsan Volume configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       sncfgedit -n VolName [-f FailedTemporaryConfigFile]

       sncfgedit -h

DESCRIPTION
       The sncfgedit program provides convenient method to edit the Xsan file
       system configuration file for the named file system and validate the new
       configuration file before overwriting the old one.  To do so, sncfgedit
       creates a temporary copy of the configuration file, and then opens it in
       an editor.

       sncfgedit uses the the EDITOR environment variable to choose the program
       used to edit the configuration file, or vi if EDITOR is not set.

       Validation includes standalone validation of the new configuration file
       as well as validation of changes between original configuration file and
       edited file if a configuration file previously existed.  If no previous
       configuration file exists, a template will be loaded into the editor
       using default settings for all values.

       Before an existing configuration file is overwritten, it is copied to
       /Library/Logs/Xsan/data/VolName/config_history/ for future reference.  A
       timestamp is appended to the filename to allow for the existence of
       multiple backup copies.

OPTIONS
       -h     Display usage.

       -n VolName
              Required. The name of the file system whose config is to be edited
              or created.

       -f FailedTemporaryConfigFile
              Specify the path to the temporary config file from a previous run
              where the proposed changes were disallowed. This gives you another
              chance without throwing away all of the previous changes.

EXIT VALUES
       sncfgedit will return 0 on success and non-zero on failure.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       EDITOR Allows the user to choose which editor is used to modify the
              configuration file.  (default: vi)
