NAME
     hdid â€“ historical mechanism for attaching disk images

SYNOPSIS
     hdid [options] image

DESCRIPTION
     Historically, hdid was both the tool used to attach a disk image and the
     user process used to load and decompress disk image data for the hard disk
     image (HDI) driver in Mac OS X.  hdid exists only for backwards
     compatibility.

     As of Mac OS X 10.4, hdid invokes
           hdiutil attach -agent hdid
     which causes hdiutil(1) to behave like the historical hdid.  For example,
     some of hdiutil attach's more modern behaviors (such as verifying images
     which haven't been verified before) are disabled.  hdiutil(1) should be
     used instead of hdid.
