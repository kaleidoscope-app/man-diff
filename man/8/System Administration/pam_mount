NAME
     pam_mount – Home Folder Mounting PAM module

SYNOPSIS
     [service-name] function-class control-flag pam_mount [options]

DESCRIPTION
     The Home Folder Mounting PAM module supports the authentication and session
     management function classes.  In terms of the function-class parameter,
     these are “auth” and “session” respectively.

   The Home Folder Mounting Authentication Module
     The Home Folder Mounting authentication module reads the mount
     authenticator from the PAM authentication context and caches it in the PAM
     environment.  The Home Folder Mounting Session Management Module must be
     used in conjunction with this module to remove the authenticator from the
     PAM environment.

   The Home Folder Mounting Session Management Module
     The Home Folder Mounting session management module copies the mount
     authenticator from the PAM environment, removes it from the PAM
     environment, and uses its copy to mount the user's home folder if the
     user's OpenDirectory record indicates that an AFP, SMB, NFS or FileVault
     home folder is to be used.

     When the session is closed, the Home Folder Mounting session management
     module unmounts the user's home folder if it was mounted by this module
     when the session was opened.
