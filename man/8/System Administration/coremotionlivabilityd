COREMOTIONLIVABILITYD(8)     System Manager's Manual    COREMOTIONLIVABILITYD(8)

NAME
     coremotionlivabilityd â€“ The daemon responds to system events and scheduled
     timers to sample sensor data and logs, and posts them back to Motion team.

SYNOPSIS
     takes no arguments, and users should not launch it manually.

DESCRIPTION
     The daemon responds to system events and scheduled timers to sample sensor
     data and logs, and posts them back to Motion team. This daemon will be
     internal-only, and launch-on-demand. Only users who explicitly install the
     companion App will launch the daemon, and once they delete the App, the
     daemon stops implementing data collection. Other users (internal or
     external) should never see the daemon launch or run. The data are used for
     validation and algorithm development of CoreMotion TLFs.

HISTORY
     This is the first time this process is introduced to macOS.
