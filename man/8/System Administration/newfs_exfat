NEWFS_EXFAT(8)               System Manager's Manual              NEWFS_EXFAT(8)

NAME
     newfs_exfat â€“ construct a new ExFAT file system

SYNOPSIS
     newfs_exfat [-N] [-R] [-I volume-serial-number] [-S bytes-per-sector]
                 [-a sectors-per-FAT] [-b bytes-per-cluster]
                 [-c sectors-per-cluster] [-n number-of-FATs] [-s total-sectors]
                 [-v volume-name] special

DESCRIPTION
     The newfs_exfat utility creates an ExFAT file system on device special.  If
     the -R option is not given, and the device is already formatted as ExFAT,
     it will preserve the partition offset, bytes per cluster, FAT offset and
     size, number of FATs, offset to start of clusters, number of clusters,
     volume serial number, and volume name (label).  If a volume name was
     specified via the -v option, that name is used instead of the volume's
     previous name.

     The options are as follow:

     -N      Don't create a file system: just print out parameters.

     -R      Do not check whether the device is currently formatted as ExFAT.
             Always derive the partition offset, bytes per cluster, FAT offset
             and size, and offset to start of clusters based on the device type
             and size.

     -I volume-serial-number
             Volume ID, a 32-bit integer.

     -S bytes-per-sector
             Number of bytes per sector.  Acceptable values are powers of 2 in
             the range 512 through 4096.

     -a sectors-per-FAT
             Number of sectors per FAT.

     -b bytes-per-cluster
             File system block size (bytes per cluster).  Acceptable values are
             powers of 2 in the range 512 through 33554432.

     -c sectors-per-cluster
             Sectors per cluster.  Acceptable values are powers of 2 in the
             range 1 through 65536.

     -n number-of-FATs
             Number of FATs.  Acceptable values are 1 or 2.  The default is 1.
             Using any value other than 1 is discouraged, and may be
             incompatible with other devices.

     -s total-sectors
             The total number of sectors in the device.

     -v volume-name
             Volume name (label).  The name will be converted to UTF-16, and
             must be no longer than 11 UTF-16 characters.  ASCII control
             characters and some punctuation characters are not allowed (similar
             to DOS 8.3-style names).  NOTE: The volume name may be an empty
             (zero-length) string.

EXAMPLES
           newfs_exfat /dev/disk0s1
     Create a file system, using default parameters (or existing ExFAT layout),
     on /dev/rdisk0s1.
           newfs_exfat -v Hello disk2s1
     Create a file system with the name "Hello" on /dev/rdisk2s1.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Exit status is 0 on success and 1 on error.

HISTORY
     The newfs_exfat command appeared in Mac OS X 10.6.3.
