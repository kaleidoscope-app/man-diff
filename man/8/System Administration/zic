NAME
     zic – timezone compiler

SYNOPSIS
     zic [--version] [-Dsv] [-d directory] [-g group] [-L leapsecondfilename]
         [-l localtime] [-m mode] [-p posixrules] [-u user] [-y command]
         [filename ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The zic utility reads text from the file(s) named on the command line and
     creates the time conversion information files specified in this input.  If
     a filename is -, the standard input is read.

     The following options are available:

     --version
             Output version information and exit.

     -D      Do not automatically create directories.  If the input file(s)
             specify an output file in a directory which does not already exist,
             the default behavior is to attempt to create the directory.  If -D
             is specified, zic will instead error out immediately.

     -d directory
             Create time conversion information files in the named directory
             rather than in the standard directory named below.

     -g group
             After creating each output file, change its group ownership to the
             specified group (which can be either a name or a numeric group ID).

     -L leapsecondfilename
             Read leap second information from the file with the given name.  If
             this option is not used, no leap second information appears in
             output files.

     -l timezone
             Use the given time zone as local time.  The zic utility will act as
             if the input contained a link line of the form

                   Link timezone       localtime

             (Note that this action has no effect on FreeBSD, since the local
             time zone is specified in /etc/localtime and not
             /usr/share/zoneinfo/localtime.)

     -m mode
             After creating each output file, change its access mode to mode.
             Both numeric and alphabetic modes are accepted (see chmod(1)).

     -p timezone
             Use the given time zone's rules when handling POSIX-format time
             zone environment variables.  The zic utility will act as if the
             input contained a link line of the form

                   Link timezone       posixrules

     -u user
             After creating each output file, change its owner to user (which
             can be either a name or a numeric user ID).

     -v      Complain if a year that appears in a data file is outside the range
             of years representable by time(3) values.

     -s      Limit time values stored in output files to values that are the
             same whether they are taken to be signed or unsigned.  You can use
             this option to generate SVVS-compatible files.

     -y command
             Use the given command rather than yearistype when checking year
             types (see below).

     Input lines are made up of fields.  Fields are separated from one another
     by any number of white space characters.  Leading and trailing white space
     on input lines is ignored.  An unquoted sharp character (#) in the input
     introduces a comment which extends to the end of the line the sharp
     character appears on.  White space characters and sharp characters may be
     enclosed in double quotes (") if they are to be used as part of a field.
     Any line that is blank (after comment stripping) is ignored.  Non-blank
     lines are expected to be of one of three types: rule lines, zone lines, and
     link lines.

     Names (such as month names) must be in English and are case insensitive.
     Abbreviations, if used, must be unambiguous in context.

     A rule line has the form:
           Rule NAME FROM TO   TYPE IN   ON        AT   SAVE LETTER/S
     For example:
           Rule US   1967 1973 -    Apr  lastSun   2:00 1:00 D

     The fields that make up a rule line are:

           NAME      Give the (arbitrary) name of the set of rules this rule is
                     part of.

           FROM      Give the first year in which the rule applies.  Any integer
                     year can be supplied; the Gregorian calendar is assumed.
                     The word minimum (or an abbreviation) means the minimum
                     year representable as an integer.  The word maximum (or an
                     abbreviation) means the maximum year representable as an
                     integer.  Rules can describe times that are not
                     representable as time values, with the unrepresentable
                     times ignored; this allows rules to be portable among hosts
                     with differing time value types.

           TO        Give the final year in which the rule applies.  In addition
                     to minimum and maximum (as above), the word only (or an
                     abbreviation) may be used to repeat the value of the FROM
                     field.

           TYPE      Give the type of year in which the rule applies.  If TYPE
                     is - then the rule applies in all years between FROM and TO
                     inclusive.  If TYPE is something else, then zic executes
                     the command yearistype year type to check the type of a
                     year: an exit status of zero is taken to mean that the year
                     is of the given type; an exit status of one is taken to
                     mean that the year is not of the given type.

           IN        Name the month in which the rule takes effect.  Month names
                     may be abbreviated.

           ON        Give the day on which the rule takes effect.  Recognized
                     forms include:

                           5        the fifth of the month
                           lastSun  the last Sunday in the month
                           lastMon  the last Monday in the month
                           Sun>=8   first Sunday on or after the eighth
                           Sun<=25  last Sunday on or before the 25th

                     Names of days of the week may be abbreviated or spelled out
                     in full.  Note that there must be no spaces within the ON
                     field.

           AT        Give the time of day at which the rule takes effect.
                     Recognized forms include:

                           2        time in hours
                           2:00     time in hours and minutes
                           15:00    24-hour format time (for times after noon)
                           1:28:14  time in hours, minutes, and seconds

                     where hour 0 is midnight at the start of the day, and hour
                     24 is midnight at the end of the day.  Any of these forms
                     may be followed by the letter ‘w’ if the given time is
                     local “wall clock” time, ‘s’ if the given time is local
                     “standard” time, or ‘u’ (or ‘g’ or ‘z’) if the given time
                     is universal time; in the absence of an indicator, wall
                     clock time is assumed.

           SAVE      Give the amount of time to be added to local standard time
                     when the rule is in effect.  This field has the same format
                     as the AT field (although, of course, the ‘w’ and ‘s’
                     suffixes are not used).

           LETTER/S  Give the “variable part” (for example, the “S” or “D” in
                     “EST” or “EDT”) of time zone abbreviations to be used when
                     this rule is in effect.  If this field is -, the variable
                     part is null.

     A zone line has the form:
           Zone NAME GMTOFF    RULES/SAVE     FORMAT    [UNTILYEAR [MONTH [DAY
           [TIME]]]]
     For example:
           Zone Australia/Adelaide  9:30 Aus  CST  1971 Oct 31 2:00
     The fields that make up a zone line are:

     NAME    The name of the time zone.  This is the name used in creating the
             time conversion information file for the zone.

     GMTOFF  The amount of time to add to UTC to get standard time in this zone.
             This field has the same format as the AT and SAVE fields of rule
             lines; begin the field with a minus sign if time must be subtracted
             from UTC.

     RULES/SAVE
             The name of the rule(s) that apply in the time zone or,
             alternately, an amount of time to add to local standard time.  If
             this field is - then standard time always applies in the time zone.

     FORMAT  The format for time zone abbreviations in this time zone.  The pair
             of characters %s is used to show where the “variable part” of the
             time zone abbreviation goes.  Alternately, a slash (/) separates
             standard and daylight abbreviations.

     UNTILYEAR [MONTH [DAY [TIME]]]
             The time at which the UTC offset or the rule(s) change for a
             location.  It is specified as a year, a month, a day, and a time of
             day.  If this is specified, the time zone information is generated
             from the given UTC offset and rule change until the time specified.
             The month, day, and time of day have the same format as the IN, ON,
             and AT fields of a rule; trailing fields can be omitted, and
             default to the earliest possible value for the missing fields.

             The next line must be a “continuation” line; this has the same form
             as a zone line except that the string “Zone” and the name are
             omitted, as the continuation line will place information starting
             at the time specified as the until information in the previous line
             in the file used by the previous line.  Continuation lines may
             contain until information, just as zone lines do, indicating that
             the next line is a further continuation.

     A link line has the form
           Link LINK-FROM LINK-TO
     For example:
           Link Europe/Istanbul     Asia/Istanbul
     The LINK-FROM field should appear as the NAME field in some zone line; the
     LINK-TO field is used as an alternate name for that zone.

     Except for continuation lines, lines may appear in any order in the input.

     Lines in the file that describes leap seconds have the following form:
           Leap YEAR MONTH     DAY  HH:MM:SS  CORR R/S
     For example:
           Leap 1974 Dec  31   23:59:60  +    S
     The YEAR, MONTH, DAY, and HH:MM:SS fields tell when the leap second
     happened.  The CORR field should be “+” if a second was added or “-” if a
     second was skipped.  The R/S field should be (an abbreviation of)
     “Stationary” if the leap second time given by the other fields should be
     interpreted as UTC or (an abbreviation of) “Rolling” if the leap second
     time given by the other fields should be interpreted as local wall clock
     time.

EXTENDED EXAMPLE
     Here is an extended example of zic input, intended to illustrate many of
     its features.

     Zone    Europe/Zurich  0:34:08  -           LMT     1848 Sep 12
                            0:29:44  -           BMT     1894 Jun
                            1:00     Swiss       CE%sT   1981
                            1:00     EU          CE%sT

     Link    Europe/Zurich  Switzerland

     In this example, the zone is named Europe/Zurich but it has an alias as
     Switzerland.  Zurich was 34 minutes and 8 seconds west of GMT until
     1848-09-12 at 00:00, when the offset changed to 29 minutes and 44 seconds.
     After 1894-06-01 at 00:00 Swiss daylight saving rules (defined with lines
     beginning with "Rule Swiss") apply, and the GMT offset became one hour.
     From 1981 to the present, EU daylight saving rules have applied, and the
     UTC offset has remained at one hour.

     In 1940, daylight saving time applied from November 2 at 00:00 to December
     31 at 00:00.  In 1941 and 1942, daylight saving time applied from the first
     Sunday in May at 02:00 to the first Sunday in October at 00:00.  The
     pre-1981 EU daylight-saving rules have no effect here, but are included for
     completeness.  Since 1981, daylight saving has begun on the last Sunday in
     March at 01:00 UTC.  Until 1995 it ended the last Sunday in September at
     01:00 UTC, but this changed to the last Sunday in October starting in 1996.

     For purposes of display, "LMT" and "BMT" were initially used, respectively.
     Since Swiss rules and later EU rules were applied, the display name for the
     timezone has been CET for standard time and CEST for daylight saving time.

NOTES
     For areas with more than two types of local time, you may need to use local
     standard time in the AT field of the earliest transition time's rule to
     ensure that the earliest transition time recorded in the compiled file is
     correct.

     If, for a particular zone, a clock advance caused by the start of daylight
     saving coincides with and is equal to a clock retreat caused by a change in
     UTC offset, zic produces a single transition to daylight saving at the new
     UTC offset (without any change in wall clock time).  To get separate
     transitions use multiple zone continuation lines specifying transition
     instants using universal time.
