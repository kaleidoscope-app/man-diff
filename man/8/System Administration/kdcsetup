                     prints errors and very basic information.  1 prints
                     generatal status information.  Higher levels may add
                     progressively more detail.

                     changes in Open Directory.  This admin will be used as the
                     administrator in the KDC database.  Required parameter.
                     Note: this is not a principal name.

     -p password     The password for the above admin.  Required parameter.

     REALM           The name of the realm that this KDC serves.  Required
                     parameter.

FILES
     /var/db/krb5kdc/               directory where all the config & database
                                    files for the KDC are stored
     /var/log/krb5kdc/              directory where the log files from the KDC
                                    are written

NOTES
     kdcsetup is automatically run when creating an Open Directory Master.  It
     should NEVER be run manually and will likely be deprecated in the future.
