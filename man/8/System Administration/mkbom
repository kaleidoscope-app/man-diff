MKBOM(8)                     System Manager's Manual                    MKBOM(8)

NAME
     mkbom â€“ create a bill-of-materials file

SYNOPSIS
     mkbom [-s] directory bom
     mkbom [-s] -i filelist bom
     mkbom -h | --help

DESCRIPTION
     The mkbom command creates a bill-of-materials (bom(5)).  You must specify
     either a source as a directory, or a text file containing a file listing as
     outputted by lsbom(8).  mkbom will generate bill-of-materials information
     based on that information.  Any existing bomfile will be overwritten by the
     new bomfile.

     Options:

     -h                    print full usage

     -s                    create a simplified bom containing only file paths

     -i filelist           use the information in filelist, one entry per line,
                           to construct the bom file. The format of the file
                           should match lsbom(8) output with no formatting
                           options (the default). If -s is given to mkbom, the
                           input filelist should contain only pathnames, as with
                           lsbom -s.

     The mkbom command appeared in NeXTSTEP as a tool to create bom files used
     during installation.
