APFS_HFS_CONVERT(8)          System Manager's Manual         APFS_HFS_CONVERT(8)

NAME
     apfs_hfs_convert â€“ convert an existing HFS file system to APFS file system

SYNOPSIS
     apfs_hfs_convert [-D] [-g] [-e] [-v] [-i] [-S path] [-n] [-f] [-F index]
                      [-M mount_path] [-o nx-apfs-format] <device-path>

DESCRIPTION
     The apfs_hfs_convert command converts an existing HFS file system to a new
     APFS file system.

     It is recommended not to run the apfs_hfs_convert directly, but to run
     `diskutil apfs convert`.

     The device-path parameter should be the path to a disk device node, such as
     /dev/disk1s2, with an existing HFS file system, which needs to be
     converted.  The device-path may be a path to a whole disk, such as
     /dev/disk0, which contains Lightweight Volume Manager (LwVM) structures;
     all HFS slices will be converted and LwVM replaced by a GPT partition map
     with a single partition containing the APFS container.

     The options are as follows:

     -e | --estimate       Estimate the APFS metadata size after conversion.

     -v | --verbose        Increase verbosity of the output.

     -s | --force-case-sensitive
                           Force the converted volume to be case-sensitive.  By
                           default, the converted volume will have the same
                           case-sensitivity as the original HFS volume.

     -S path | --stats path
                           Print statistics about the conversion to the supplied
                           path.  If the path is - then the statistics are
                           printed to standard output.

     -n | --dry-run        Do not finalize the conversion to APFS.  Volume
                           remains HFS.

     -f | --force          Force conversion if volume is dirty (journal is non-
                           empty, volume had inconsistencies, or volume is not
                           journaled and not unmounted cleanly).

     -F index | --fixed index
                           Volume number index (0-based) should be formatted as
                           fixed-size.  Usually used when converting LwVM.

     -M mount_path | --mount-path mount_path
                           When converting LwVM systems, which require a special
                           "conversion mount" of the underlying device, use the
                           given mount_path as the mount point.  If this option
                           is not used, a temporary directory will be created
                           and used.

     -o nx-apfs-format     NX or APFS format options.

     -g                    If conversion succeeds, modify the GPT UUID.

     -D | --skip-single-dirlinks
                           Convert all former and current directory hardlinks to
                           files/aliases.

     --feature-format      Allow for one-off specific formatting features to be
                           toggled on or off during the conversion to APFS.
                           Values must be specified in a CSV string.  For
                           example "feature=value,feature2=value2,..."

                           dirents=unhashed is a feature format flag that will
                           specify to the converter that it should produce a
                           volume with legacy (non-standard) directory entries.
                           That is, the resulting volume will have file names
                           that are both normalization-sensitive and case-
                           sensitive.  This is not recommended in most cases.

EXIT STATUS
     The apfs_hfs_convert utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     The following converts the HFS file system on the /dev/disk1s2 device:
           apfs_hfs_convert -v /dev/disk1s2
