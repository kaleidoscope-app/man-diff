NAME
     fontrestore â€“ Restore the available system fonts to a pristine state, if
     possible.

SYNOPSIS
     fontrestore default [-n]

DESCRIPTION
     fontrestore detects fonts in /Library/Fonts, /System/Library/Fonts, and
     ~/Library/Fonts which are not part of the system install and moves them to
     /Library/Fonts (Removed), /System/Library/Fonts (Removed), and
     ~/Library/Fonts/Fonts (Removed) directories. Critical fonts required for
     operation of the user interface are also restored.

     The [-n] option performs the same operation without touching the disk,
     describing what would be done without actually doing it.

SEE ALSO

HISTORY
     The fontrestore tool first appeared in MacOS X 10.7.
