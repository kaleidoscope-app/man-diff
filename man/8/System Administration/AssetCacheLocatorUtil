NAME
     AssetCacheLocatorUtil â€“ Utility for reporting information about macOS
     Content Caches

SYNOPSIS
     AssetCacheLocatorUtil [-j|--json]

DESCRIPTION
     AssetCacheLocatorUtil reports information related to macOS Content Caches
     running on the computer or on the local network.

     Some of the information that AssetCacheLocatorUtil reports depends on the
     current network configuration, and on the user running it.  It might
     produce different results for different users, on different client devices,
     or on different networks.  Applications that use content caches might
     choose ones other than the ones AssetCacheLocatorUtil reports due to
     factors beyond its knowledge, such as iCloud affinity.

     AssetCacheLocatorUtil reports the following information separately for
     system daemons and for the current user:

     Availability hint
             The system can temporarily save a hint about whether or not there
             might be content caches on the computer or on the local network.
             AssetCacheLocatorUtil prints that saved hint if it is available.

     Saved content caches
             The system can temporarily save information about content caches it
             has previously found on the computer or on the local network.
             AssetCacheLocatorUtil prints that saved information if it is
             available.

     Refreshed content caches
             AssetCacheLocatorUtil forces the system to search for content
             caches on the computer and on the local network and to refresh the
             saved information above.  It then prints the results.

     Saved and refreshed public IP address ranges
             If your network administrator has configured public IP address
             ranges in DNS, which the system uses when looking up content
             caches, AssetCacheLocatorUtil prints saved and refreshed
             information about those ranges.

     Saved and refreshed favored server ranges
             If your network administrator has configured favored server ranges
             in DNS, which the system uses when looking up content caches,
             AssetCacheLocatorUtil prints saved and refreshed information about
             those ranges.

     AssetCacheLocatorUtil then reports the reachability status of all of the
     content caches it found.  If the computer cannot communicate with a content
     cache over the local network then it cannot request files from that content
     cache.  However, just because the computer can "ping" a content cache does
     not imply that that content cache will serve requests sent from this
     computer.

     The --json option prints the results in machine-parseable JSON format to
     stdout.

WARNINGS
     AssetCacheLocatorUtil also reports warnings about potential issues it
     discovers.

     The Apple cloud service with which content caches register limits the
     number of content caches on a network.  This limit can change at any time.
     If a larger number of content caches are available on a network than the
     cloud allows, client devices might not always choose the "best" content
     cache.  AssetCacheLocatorUtil warns when it detects this possibility.  The
     number of content caches available on a network can be reduced by changing
     the settings of some of the content caches, using System Settings > Sharing
     > Content Caching > press the option key > Advanced Options... > Clients >
     Cache content for:.

     AssetCacheLocatorUtil warns when it detects content caches with different
     ranks.  The exact value and meaning of each rank is defined by the Apple
     cloud service with which content caches register, and can change at any
     time, but client devices use only the content caches with the lowest-
     numbered rank available to them.  A content cache's rank can be changed by
     adjusting its settings, using System Settings > Sharing > Content Caching >
     press the option key > Advanced Options... > Clients > Cache content for:.
     A content cache on the same computer as the client always has the lowest-
     numbered rank.

     Having content caches in different ranks can be intentional or accidental,
     depending on your organization.  AssetCacheLocatorUtil warns about mixed
     ranks in case it is accidental.  An example of an intentional use of mixed
     ranks is when a school has a content cache that caches content for devices
     using the same local networks and the school's district office has another
     content cache that caches content for devices using the same public IP
     address.  Client devices in the school use the school's content cache.
     Client devices in a different school in the same district use the
     district's content cache.

     Every content cache must have a unique GUID.  AssetCacheLocatorUtil warns
     when it finds content caches in your organization with duplicate GUIDs.  A
     content cache's GUID can be changed by stopping the content cache, running
     the following command in Terminal as an admin user, and then restarting it:
     sudo -u _assetcache defaults write
     /Library/Preferences/com.apple.AssetCache.plist ServerGUID = `uuidgen`

     When public IP address ranges are configured but the client device's public
     IP address is not in the configured ranges, this could prevent the device
     from using your organization's content caches.  AssetCacheLocatorUtil warns
     about this condition.  To configure custom public IP address ranges use
     System Settings > Sharing > Content Caching > press the option key >
     Advanced Options... > Clients > My local networks: and set DNS TXT records
     appropriately.

     Your network administrator can designate some content caches as "favored."
     AssetCacheLocatorUtil warns when it finds content caches that are not
     favored, with the exception of a content cache on the same computer as the
     client.  Client devices use only favored content caches when any are
     available.

     The system can temporarily mark content caches as "unhealthy" after
     attempts to use a content cache fail due to either HTTP error responses or
     network errors.  Each client device maintains its own health records for
     each content cache.  Client devices use only healthy content caches.
     AssetCacheLocatorUtil warns when any of the content caches it finds are
     unhealthy.  Note that when AssetCacheLocatorUtil refreshes the list of
     content caches, it also resets the health of every content cache it finds
     to "healthy."
