VIPW(8)                      System Manager's Manual                     VIPW(8)

NAME
     vipw – edit the password file

SYNOPSIS
     vipw

DESCRIPTION
     Vipw edits the password file after setting the appropriate locks, and does
     any necessary processing after the password file is unlocked.  If the
     password file is already locked for editing by another user, vipw will ask
     you to try again later.  The default editor for vipw is vi(1).

     Vipw performs a number of consistency checks on the password entries, and
     will not allow a password file with a “mangled” entry to be installed.  If
     vipw rejects the new password file, the user is prompted to re-enter the
     edit session.

     Once the information has been verified, vipw uses pwd_mkdb(8) to update the
     user database.  This is run in the background, and, at very large sites
     could take several minutes.  Until this update is completed, the password
     file is unavailable for other updates and the new information is not
     available to programs.

ENVIRONMENT
     If the following environment variable exists it will be utilized by vipw:

     EDITOR  The editor specified by the string EDITOR will be invoked instead
             of the default editor vi(1).

SEE ALSO
     chpass(1), passwd(1), passwd(5), pwd_mkdb(8)

HISTORY
     The vipw command appeared in 4.0BSD.
