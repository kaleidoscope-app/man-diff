DISCARD(8)                   System Manager's Manual                  DISCARD(8)




NAME
       discard - Postfix discard mail delivery agent

SYNOPSIS
       discard [generic Postfix daemon options]

DESCRIPTION
       The Postfix discard(8) delivery agent processes delivery requests from
       the queue manager. Each request specifies a queue file, a sender address,
       a next-hop destination that is treated as the reason for discarding the
       mail, and recipient information.  The reason may be prefixed with an RFC
       3463-compatible detail code.  This program expects to be run from the
       master(8) process manager.

       The discard(8) delivery agent pretends to deliver all recipients in the
       delivery request, logs the "next-hop" destination as the reason for
       discarding the mail, updates the queue file, and either marks recipients
       as finished or informs the queue manager that delivery should be tried
       again at a later time.

       Delivery status reports are sent to the trace(8) daemon as appropriate.

SECURITY
       The discard(8) mailer is not security-sensitive. It does not talk to the
       network, and can be run chrooted at fixed low privilege.

STANDARDS
       RFC 3463 (Enhanced Status Codes)

DIAGNOSTICS
       Problems and transactions are logged to syslogd(8).

       Depending on the setting of the notify_classes parameter, the postmaster
       is notified of bounces and of other trouble.

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
       Changes to main.cf are picked up automatically as discard(8) processes
       run for only a limited amount of time. Use the command "postfix reload"
       to speed up a change.

       The text below provides only a parameter summary. See postconf(5) for
       more details including examples.

       config_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)
              The default location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf
              configuration files.

       daemon_timeout (18000s)
              How much time a Postfix daemon process may take to handle a
              request before it is terminated by a built-in watchdog timer.

       delay_logging_resolution_limit (2)
              The maximal number of digits after the decimal point when logging
              sub-second delay values.

       double_bounce_sender (double-bounce)
              The sender address of postmaster notifications that are generated
              by the mail system.

       ipc_timeout (3600s)
              The time limit for sending or receiving information over an
              internal communication channel.

       max_idle (100s)
              The maximum amount of time that an idle Postfix daemon process
              waits for an incoming connection before terminating voluntarily.

       max_use (100)
              The maximal number of incoming connections that a Postfix daemon
              process will service before terminating voluntarily.

       process_id (read-only)
              The process ID of a Postfix command or daemon process.

       process_name (read-only)
              The process name of a Postfix command or daemon process.

       queue_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)
              The location of the Postfix top-level queue directory.

       syslog_facility (mail)
              The syslog facility of Postfix logging.

       syslog_name (see 'postconf -d' output)
              A prefix that is prepended to the process name in syslog records,
              so that, for example, "smtpd" becomes "prefix/smtpd".
