NAME
       qos - Xsan File System FSM QoS Central Config File

SYNOPSIS
       /Library/Preferences/Xsan/*_rvio.opt

DESCRIPTION
       The Xsan File System qos config file defines the bandwidth reservation
       for non-rtio (rvio) on certain clients from a central place, i.e. the fsm
       server. The allocated rvio bandwidth is used for non-rtio IOs on the
       client. The config file has the name of the designated volume's name
       appended by "_rvio.opt". So if the volume is "default", the QoS config
       file will be "default_rvio.opt". If this file does not exist, there will
       be no rvio bandwidth reservation for any client.

       non-rtio reservation (rvio) provides a second priority bandwidth
       reservation mechanism for certain clients, while rtio request has the
       highest priority and will be satisfied first. All rvio requests share the
       remaining bandwidth after rtio requests are satisfied. If all rvio
       requests cannot be satisfied, then each rvio client is allocated the
       bandwidth directly proportional to its request amount. With dynamic
       changes of rtio requests, the allocated rvio bandwidths for clients are
       dynamically adjusted.

SYNTAX
       A QoS central config file has multiple lines, each line defines the rvio
       reservation for a client. If a client has multiple IP addresses, the rvio
       reservation should be defined for each ip address.

       The format of an line in QoS central config file is:

          <host> <bw-type> <sg=yy>[,sg=yy]

       <host> is the client host name. This can be the IP address (either V4 or
       V6), host name or FQDN of the client. Note: the host name should be able
       to be resolved (converted to a valid IP address) by the fsm server.

       The <bw-type> is the type of bandwidth to be specified. Two types exists:

          qosios         the bandwidth unit is IOs per second
          qosmb          the bandwidth unit is mega bytes per second

       If "qosios" is used, you may also append multiplier suffix to the amount
       of bandwidth:

          Suffix    Name    Multiplier
          ------    ----    ----------
            K       kilo    1,024
            M       mega    1,048,576

       The <sg=yy> defines the bandwidth on the designated storage pool. sg is
       the designated storage pool, yy is the reserved bandwidth. You can only
       reserve bandwidth on storage pools whose QoS parameters have been
       configured in the volume config file. There are three ways to specify a
       storage pool:

          *       the wildcard for storage pool, applies to all storage pool
          sgname  the name of a storage pool
          sgnum   the number of a storage pool, storage pool starts from 0.

       Lines that contain white space only or that contain the comment token as
       the first non-white space character are ignored. An example on how to
       configure QoS central config file can be found:
