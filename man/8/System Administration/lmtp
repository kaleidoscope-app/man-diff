SMTP(8)                      System Manager's Manual                     SMTP(8)




NAME
       smtp - Postfix SMTP+LMTP client

SYNOPSIS
       smtp [generic Postfix daemon options]

DESCRIPTION
       The Postfix SMTP+LMTP client implements the SMTP and LMTP mail delivery
       protocols. It processes message delivery requests from the queue manager.
       Each request specifies a queue file, a sender address, a domain or host
       to deliver to, and recipient information.  This program expects to be run
       from the master(8) process manager.

       The SMTP+LMTP client updates the queue file and marks recipients as
       finished, or it informs the queue manager that delivery should be tried
       again at a later time. Delivery status reports are sent to the bounce(8),
       defer(8) or trace(8) daemon as appropriate.

       The SMTP+LMTP client looks up a list of mail exchanger addresses for the
       destination host, sorts the list by preference, and connects to each
       listed address until it finds a server that responds.

       When a server is not reachable, or when mail delivery fails due to a
       recoverable error condition, the SMTP+LMTP client will try to deliver the
       mail to an alternate host.

       After a successful mail transaction, a connection may be saved to the
       scache(8) connection cache server, so that it may be used by any
       SMTP+LMTP client for a subsequent transaction.

       By default, connection caching is enabled temporarily for destinations
       that have a high volume of mail in the active queue. Connection caching
       can be enabled permanently for specific destinations.

SMTP DESTINATION SYNTAX
       SMTP destinations have the following form:

       domainname

       domainname:port
              Look up the mail exchangers for the specified domain, and connect
              to the specified port (default: smtp).

       [hostname]

       [hostname]:port
              Look up the address(es) of the specified host, and connect to the
              specified port (default: smtp).

       [address]

       [address]:port
              Connect to the host at the specified address, and connect to the
              specified port (default: smtp). An IPv6 address must be formatted
              as [ipv6:address].

LMTP DESTINATION SYNTAX
       LMTP destinations have the following form:

       unix:pathname
              Connect to the local UNIX-domain server that is bound to the
              specified pathname. If the process runs chrooted, an absolute
              pathname is interpreted relative to the Postfix queue directory.

       inet:hostname

       inet:hostname:port

       inet:[address]

       inet:[address]:port
              Connect to the specified TCP port on the specified local or remote
              host. If no port is specified, connect to the port defined as lmtp
              in services(4).  If no such service is found, the lmtp_tcp_port
              configuration parameter (default value of 24) will be used.  An
              IPv6 address must be formatted as [ipv6:address].

SECURITY
       The SMTP+LMTP client is moderately security-sensitive. It talks to SMTP
       or LMTP servers and to DNS servers on the network. The SMTP+LMTP client
       can be run chrooted at fixed low privilege.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Problems and transactions are logged to syslogd(8).  Corrupted message
       files are marked so that the queue manager can move them to the corrupt
       queue for further inspection.

       Depending on the setting of the notify_classes parameter, the postmaster
       is notified of bounces, protocol problems, and of other trouble.

BUGS
       SMTP and LMTP connection caching does not work with TLS. The necessary
       support for TLS object passivation and re-activation does not exist
       without closing the session, which defeats the purpose.

       SMTP and LMTP connection caching assumes that SASL credentials are valid
       for all destinations that map onto the same IP address and TCP port.

CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
       Before Postfix version 2.3, the LMTP client is a separate program that
       implements only a subset of the functionality available with SMTP: there
       is no support for TLS, and connections are cached in-process, making it
       ineffective when the client is used for multiple domains.

       Most smtp_xxx configuration parameters have an lmtp_xxx "mirror"
       parameter for the equivalent LMTP feature. This document describes only
       those LMTP-related parameters that aren't simply "mirror" parameters.

       Changes to main.cf are picked up automatically, as smtp(8) processes run
       for only a limited amount of time. Use the command "postfix reload" to
       speed up a change.

       The text below provides only a parameter summary. See postconf(5) for
       more details including examples.
