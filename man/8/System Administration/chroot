NAME
     chroot â€“ change root directory

SYNOPSIS
     chroot [-G group[,group ...]] [-g group] [-u user] newroot
            [command [arg ...]]

DESCRIPTION
     The chroot utility changes its current and root directories to the supplied
     directory newroot and then exec's command with provided arguments, if
     supplied, or an interactive copy of the user's login shell.

     The options are as follows:

     -G group[,group ...]  Run the command with the permissions of the specified
                           groups.

     -g group              Run the command with the permissions of the specified
                           group.

     -u user               Run the command as the user.

ENVIRONMENT
     The following environment variable is referenced by chroot:

     SHELL  If set, the string specified by SHELL is interpreted as the name of
            the shell to exec.  If the variable SHELL is not set, /bin/sh is
            used.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Chrooting into a New Root Directory

       The following command opens the csh(1) shell after chrooting to the
       standard root directory.

         # chroot / /bin/csh

     Example 2: Execution of a Command with a Changed Root Directory

       The following command changes a root directory with chroot and then runs
       ls(1) to list the contents of /sbin.

         # chroot /tmp/testroot ls /sbin
