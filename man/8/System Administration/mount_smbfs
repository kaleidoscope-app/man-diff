MOUNT_SMBFS(8)               System Manager's Manual              MOUNT_SMBFS(8)

NAME
     mount_smbfs – mount a shared resource from an SMB file server

SYNOPSIS
     mount_smbfs [-N] [-o options] [-d mode] [-f mode] [-h] [-s] [-t gmt_token]
                 [-v] //[domain;][user[:password]@]server[/share] path

DESCRIPTION
     The mount_smbfs command mounts a share from a remote server using SMB/CIFS
     protocol.

     The options are as follows:

     -N      Do not ask for a password.  At run time, mount_smbfs reads the
             ~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf file for additional configuration
             parameters and a password.  If no password is found, mount_smbfs
             prompts for it.

     -o      Options passed to mount(2) are specified with the -o option
             followed by a comma separated string of options. See the mount(8)
             man page for possible options and their meanings. Additional
             options supported by the mount_smbfs are as follows:

             nobrowse
                     This option indicates that the mount point should not be
                     visible via the GUI (i.e., appear on the Desktop as a
                     separate volume).

             automounted
                     Set flags on the mountpoint to indicate that the volume has
                     been mounted by the automounter.

             nostreams
                     Don't use NTFS Streams even if they are supported by the
                     server.

             soft    Make the mount soft. Fail file system calls after a number
                     of seconds.

             nonotification
                     Turn off using notifications for this volume.

             nodatacache
                     Turn off using file data caching for this volume.

             nomdatacache
                     Turn off using meta data caching for this volume.

             sessionencrypt
                     Force session encryption to be used

             shareencrypt
                     Force share encryption to be used for that share and also
                     for IPC$ traffic

     -f mode, -d mode
             Specify permissions that should be assigned to files and
             directories.  The values must be specified as octal numbers.
             Default value for the file mode is taken from mount point, default
             value for the directory mode adds execute permission where the file
             mode gives read permission.

             Note that these permissions can differ from the rights granted by
             SMB server.

     -h      Prints a help message, much like the SYNOPSIS above.

     -s      Force a new session to be created to the server.

     -t gmt_token
             Do a read only mount using the specific snapshot of the share.  A
             new session is created to allow multiple snapshots of the same
             share to be mounted.  Value must be in GMT format e.g. @GMT-
             YYYY.MM.DD-HH.MM.SS

     -v      Prints version.

     //[domain;][user[:password]@] server[/share]
             The mount_smbfs command will use server as the NetBIOS name of
             remote computer, user as the remote user name and share as the
             resource name on a remote server.  Domain and/or password may be
             specified here.  If user is omitted the logged in user id will be
             used.  Omitting share is an error when mount_smbfs is run from the
             command line, otherwise a browsing dialogue is presented.

     path    Path to mount point.

FILES
     nsmb.conf      Keeps static parameters for connections and other
                    information.  See man nsmb.conf for details.

EXAMPLES
     This example shows the proper url to use to mount the share PUBLIC from the
     SMB server myserver :

           mkdir /smb/public
           mount -t smbfs //username:userpass@myserver/PUBLIC /smb/public

     This example shows the proper url to use to mount the share PUBLIC from the
     SMB server myserver as guest:

           mkdir /smb/public
           mount -t smbfs //guest:@myserver/PUBLIC /smb/public
     Note: You should always use the system mount command and never call
     mount_smbfs directly.
