NAME
     kcm – process-based credential cache for Kerberos tickets.

SYNOPSIS
     kcm [--cache-name=cachename] [-c file | --config-file=file]
         [-g group | --group=group] [--max-request=size]
         [--disallow-getting-krbtgt] [--use-uid-matching] [--detach]
         [-h | --help] [-k principal | --system-principal=principal]
         [-l time | --lifetime=time] [-n | --no-name-constraints]
         [-r time | --renewable-life=time] [-s path | --socket-path=path]
         [--door-path=path] [-S principal | --server=principal]
         [-t keytab | --keytab=keytab] [-u user | --user=user] [-v | --version]

DESCRIPTION
     kcm is a process based credential cache.  To use it, set the KRB5CCNAME
     enviroment variable to ‘KCM:uid’ or add the stanza


     [libdefaults]
             default_cc_name = KCM:%{uid}

     to the /etc/krb5.conf configuration file and make sure kcm is started in
     the system startup files.

     The kcm daemon can hold the credentials for all users in the system.
     Access control is done with Unix-like permissions.  The daemon checks the
     access on all operations based on the uid of the user.  The tickets are
     renewed as long as is permitted by the KDC's policy.

     The kcm daemon can also keep a SYSTEM credential that server processes can
     use to access services.  One example of usage might be an nss_ldap module
     that quickly needs to get credentials and doesn't want to renew the ticket
     itself.

     --use-uid-matching
