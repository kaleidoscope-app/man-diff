NAME
     sso_util – Kerberos – Open Directory Single Sign On

SYNOPSIS
     sso_util command [-args]

DESCRIPTION
     sso_util is a tool for setting up, interrogating and removing Kerberos
     configurations within the Apple Single Sign On environment. This tool can
     configure services, create and consume encrypted config records and tear
     down Kerberos installations

     Commands for sso_util :

     info [-p] [-g | -l | -L | -r dir_node_path [dir_node_path]]
              Returns information about the current Single Sign On environment

              info command arguments:

              -p       Returns the data in XML format

              -g       Returns the default Kerberos realm name

              -l       Returns a list of the services sso_util knows how to
                       Kerberize

              -L       Returns the default Kerberos log file paths

              -r dir_node_path
                       Returns whether or not the given node has a Kerberos
                       record associated with it. If it does, it returns the
                       default realm name.  If dir_node_path is '.' (default) it
                       also returns all the realm names available on the search
                       path

              dir_node_path
                       specifies the directory node in which to search for the
                       computer record

     configure -r REALM -a admin_name [-p password] service
              Configures Kerberized services on the local machine for the given
              realm

              configure command arguments:

              -r REALM
                       Kerberos realm for the service principals

              -a admin_name
                       Account name of an administrator authorized to make
                       changes in the Kerberos database

              -p password
                       Password for the above administrator. The password can
                       also be stored in a file and the path to the file can be
                       passed as an environment variable - SSO_PASSWD_PATH.

              service  Service can be any number of afp, ftp, imap, pop, smtp,
                       ssh, fcsvr, DNS, or all

     useconfig [-u] [-R record_name] [-f dir_node_path] -a admin_name [-p
              password]
              Uses a secure config record to configure a server for Kerberos

              configure command arguments:

              -u       Forces the update, ignoring that the update may already
                       have been installed

              -R record_name
                       Name of the Computer record containing the secure config
                       record

              -f dir_node_path
                       Specifies the directory node in which to find the given
                       computer record

              -a admin_name
                       Account name of an user authorized to use the secure
                       config record (see generateconfig)

              -p password
                       Password for the above user. The password can also be
                       stored in a file and the path to the file can be passed
                       as an environment variable - SSO_PASSWD_PATH.

EXAMPLES
     To configure a server in realm FOO.COM when you have the Kerberos
     administrator's password. Store the password in a file and set env var
     SSO_PASSWD_PATH to the file path

     sso_util configure -r FOO.COM -a kerberos_admin all

     To create a secure config record to allow the delegated administrators,
     Fred and Barney, to configure a server named fred.foo.com in realm FOO.COM
     (using an existing computer record). The Open Directory Master for foo.com
     is odmaster.foo.com. This can be run on any server and neither Fred nor
     Barney need to have the Kerberos administrator's password. Store the
     password in a file and set env var SSO_PASSWD_PATH to the file path.

     sso_util generateconfig -r FOO.COM -R fred.foo.com -f
     /LDAPv3/odmaster.foo.com  -U Fred,Barney -a kerberos_admin all

     To use the secure config record to allow Barney to configure the server
     named fred.foo.com. Store the password in a file and set env var
     SSO_PASSWD_PATH to the file path.

     sso_util useconfig -R fred.foo.com -f /LDAPv3/odmaster.foo.com -a Barney

FILES
     /etc/krb5.keytab  The configure and useconfig commands create or modify the
                       krb5.keytab file.

DIAGNOSTICS
     You can add -v debug_level to any of the sso_util commands. Debug level 1
     provides status information, higher levels add progressively more levels of
     detail. The maximum is level 7.

NOTES
     The sso_util tool is used by the Apple Single Sign On system to set up
     Kerberized services integrated with the rest of the Single Sign On
     components.
