NAME
       snlicense - Report Xsan license status

SYNOPSIS
       snlicense [-v|-m|-n|-h|-p] [-f license-file] [-i file] [-r json|ascii]
              [-s system-id] license_type [nocap]


DESCRIPTION
       snlicense imports new licenses and reports on the current license status.

       Reports include information such as license status, capacities and
       expirations.  The currently supported license types can be displayed by
       typing snlicense -h.

       The optional nocap argument is for internal use only to prevent a hang
       when certain components are not fully initialized.


OPTIONS
       -f license-file
              Will use an alternative license file.  The default license file is
              /Library/Preferences/Xsan/license.dat.

       -h     Display help

       -i file
              Import licenses from the specified file

       -m     Will cause the output to be printed in a machine readable format

       -n     No RAS messages for license warnings and errors

       -p     Shows whether a product key is needed and if so, whether it exists
              and is valid

       -P cvfsid
              Validates the product key for both MDCs of an HA pair

       -s system-id
              Check the license entry for the specified system-identifier

       -r json|ascii
              Report on license service usage.

       -v     Will cause more license info to be reported


USAGE
       Use this command with the -i option to import licenses from the command
       line or without the -i option to check the current status of a particular
       license.  To check the status, execute the program with the desired
       license type. See examples below for more info.


IMPORTING LICENSES
       The -i file_to_import option can be used to import licenses from the
       downloaded license file into the local license file.

       NOTE:  The licenses are only imported to the local computer.  For High
       Availability (HA) systems, the license file must be imported on both
       computers.


LICENSE EXPIRATION
       Some licenses are cross-checked for expiration such that if one license
       expires, all cross-checked licenses are considered expired.

       The -v option can be used to determine the expiration date of the feature
       and the expiration date of the feature with cross-checking.


       • The "Actual expiration" is when the feature itself expires.

       • "License expiration" is when the feature will become unusable due to
         one or more cross-checked licenses expiring.


       Note: In some cases it is invalid to mix expiring licenses with non-
       expiring licenses.  One notable exception is the maintenance license
       (which typically has an expiration).

       The -v option will display a warning if there is mixed-expiration error
       on the specified license.


LICENSE SERVICE REPORT
       The -r option reports on the license service usage.  The license service
       is only used with 'san_client' and 'file_system' licenses.


EXAMPLES FOR CHECKING LICENSE STATUS
       When the command is run, the license info for the indicated Xsan feature
       is reported. Note that if license status cannot be determined for a
       feature it is treated as NOT licensed. Also note some features have an
       associated capacity and some do not.


       Examples:

       Properly licensed with capacity available:

            % snlicense proxy
            - The proxy license status is: Good

            % snlicense -v proxy
            - Found existing license: proxy
            - License expiration:     None
            - Actual expiration:      None
            - Licensed capacity:      65535 connections
            - Current used capacity:  NA
            - The proxy license status is: Good


       Properly licensed (non-capacity license):

            % snlicense maintenance
            - The maintenance license status is: Good

            % snlicense -v maintenance
            - Found existing license: maintenance
            - License expiration:     None
            - Actual expiration:      None
            - The maintenance license status is: Good


       Unlicensed feature:

            % snlicense failover
            - The failover license status is: License Missing

            % snlicense -v failover
            - The failover license status is: License Missing


       A valid temporary license:

            % snlicense -v failover
            - Found existing license: failover
            - License expiration:     Thu Nov  1 23:59:59 2012
            - Actual expiration:      Thu Nov  1 23:59:59 2012
            - The failover license status is: Good


       Expired license:

            % snlicense failover
            - The failover license status is: Expired

            % snlicense -v failover
            - Found existing license: failover
            - License expiration:     Thu Jan  1 23:59:59 2009
            - Actual expiration:      Thu Jan  1 23:59:59 2009
            - The failover license status is: Expired

       Mixed permanent and expiring licenses:

            % snlicense server
            - Having both permanent and temporary licenses is not allowed
              (except for 'maintenance' and DLAN 'proxy' licenses).

            % snlicense -v server
            - Found existing license: server
            - License expiration:     Jan  1 23:59:59 2009
            - Actual expiration:      None
            - Licensed capacity:      10 connections
            - Current used capacity:  NA
            - Having both permanent and temporary licenses is not allowed
              (except for 'maintenance' and DLAN 'proxy' licenses).

            % snlicense failover
            - Having both permanent and temporary licenses is not allowed
              (except for 'maintenance' and DLAN 'proxy' licenses).

            % snlicense -v failover
            - Found existing license: failover
            - License expiration:     Jan  1 23:59:59 2009
            - Actual expiration:      Jan  1 23:59:59 2009
            - Having both permanent and temporary licenses is not allowed
              (except for 'maintenance' and DLAN 'proxy' licenses).
