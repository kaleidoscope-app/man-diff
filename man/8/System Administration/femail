FEMAIL(8)                    System Manager's Manual                   FEMAIL(8)

NAME
     femail â€“ accept mail on behalf of a real MTA

SYNOPSIS
     femail [-46tv] [-f from] [-F name] [address ...]

DESCRIPTION
     femail is intended to be used on servers that do not run a real MTA or
     inside chroot(8) environments.  It features a sendmail(8)-compatible
     command line interface and forwards mail via SMTP to the host given in the
     config file, an environment variable or localhost.

     The options are as follows:

     -4        Only use IPv4.

     -6        Only use IPv6.

     -F name   Set the sender's name to name.

     -f from   Set the sender address to from.  Normally, femail tries to parse
               the sender from the message, and uses login@hostname if that is
               not present.

     -t        Read recipients from the message given on stdin, in addition to
               the recipients given on the command line.

     -v        Enable verbose operation.

CONFIG FILE
     The config file, /etc/femail.conf, consists of simple name=value pairs.
     The supported settings are as follows:

     smtphost  Specify the server femail should send the messages to.

     smtpport  Specify the port femail uses on smtphost to send the messages.
               Default is 25.

     myname    The hostname femail uses.  Defaults to the machine's hostname.

ENVIRONMENT
     SMTPHOST         Forward mail to the given host instead of the local host.
                      Only consulted when not set in the config file.

     SMTPPORT         Connect to the given port instead of 25.  Only consulted
                      when not set in the config file.
