CVGATHER(8)                  System Manager's Manual                 CVGATHER(8)



NAME
       cvgather - Compile debugging information for a Xsan File System

       (The Windows version of cvgather contains different features and options.
       See the StorNext Windows "Gather Debugging Info (cvgather.exe)" help page
       for more information.)

SYNOPSIS
       cvgather -f_VolName [-sukxr] [-o OutputFile] [-n NumberOfCvlogs]
              [-U UserCore] [-K KernelCore] [-p SnfsPath]

DESCRIPTION
       The cvgather program is used to collect debug information from a volume.
       This creates a tar file of the system's Xsan File System debug logs,
       configuration, version information and disk devices.

       The cvgather program will collect client debug information on client
       machines and server information on server machines, as well as portmapper
       information from all machines. System log files as well as Xsan log files
       are included.  At the users option, cvgather also collects core files
       from user space utilities, such as the fsm, and also from the operating
       system kernel, when available.

USAGE
       When the operator encounters an error using Xsan and wishes to send
       debugging information to Apple technical support, the cvgather utility
       may be run.  The following command arguments and options affect the
       behavior of cvgather.


       -f VolName
              Specify the name of the volume for which debugging information
              should be collected. Some information is universal to all
              installed volumes, while some is unique to each file system.

       -k     Collect the core file from the operating system kernel. This
              option is not supported on Linux. The -k option collects the
              kernel core from the default location for the machine's operating
              system. To collect the kernel core from another location use -K.

       -K KernelCore
              Collect the kernel core file from any file. You must specify the
              full filename as well as the path.

       -n NumberOfCvlogs
              Specify the number of cvlog files to include in the tarball. If
              this option is not selected, 4 will be used. This is the default
              number of cvlogs used by the fsm.

       -o OutputFile
              Specify the name of the output file. This name is appended with a
              _timestamp and the suffix '.tgz'. The timestamp is appended to the
              filename to allow for the existence of multiple tar files. If this
              option is not selected, the name of the volume will be used as a
              default.

       -p SnfsPath
              Specify the file path to the Xsan install directory.  If this
              option is not selected, the path
              /System/Library/Filesystems/acfs.fs/Contents will be used as a
              default.

       -s     Gather symbol information without core files.

       -u     Collect the core file from user executables, such as the fsm.  By
              default, if they exist, cvgather will pick up a file named "core"
              and the the most recently modified "core.*" file on systems that
              support core file names with extensions.  The -u option collects
              core files from the 'debug' directory in the Xsan directory.  To
              collect user core files from another location or core files with
              with non-standard names use -U.

       -U UserCore
              Collect the user core file from any file. You must specify the
              full filename as well as the path.

       -r     Show numerical addresses instead of trying to determine symbolic
              host

       -x     Exclude files that are collected by pse_snapshot. Note that this
              option is intended to be used by pse_snapshot only and not for
              general use. The behavior of this option may change without
              warning.

       When cvgather is run it will create a tar file, that can be simply e-
       mailed to Apple technical support for evaluation. It is recommended that
       the tar file be compressed into a standard compression format such as
       compress, gzip, or bzip2.

NOTES
       IMPORTANT: cvgather creates a number of temporary files, thus must have
       write privileges for the directory in which it is run. These files, as
       well as the output tar file can be very large, especially when the kernel
       core file is included, thus adequate disk space must be available.

       Several important log files are only accessible by the root user, thus it
       is important that cvgather be run with root privileges to gather the
       entire range of useful information.
