APFSUSERAGENT(8)             System Manager's Manual            APFSUSERAGENT(8)

NAME
     APFSUserAgent â€“ APFS new container observer

DESCRIPTION
     The APFSUserAgent watches for IOKit notifications about new APFS containers
     appearing, and about volume hash mismatch.

     If APFSUserAgent finds a new container with an encrypted volume, it will
     pop up a DiskUnlock dialog to ask the user for volume unlock password.

     The APFSUserAgent can display the following notifications:
     Incompatible Features - Mounting the device (volume or container) was
     rejected because it uses features that are not supported by the current
     version of macOS. Updating to a newer version of macOS may allow the device
     to mount.
     Volume Hash Mismatch - The cryptographic integrity of the volume is not
     valid. Reinstalling macOS on this volume will fix its integrity.

     The APFSUserAgent uses the defaults bundle com.apple.APFSUserAgent in order
     to control whether or not to pop notifications or automatically ask the
     user to unlock an encrypted volume.
     The settings are controlled globally - for all devices, or locally - for a
     specific volume or container, identified by its UUID.  In the defaults
     dictionary, the key is the action that the user would like to mute, and the
     value is the date to mute up to.  APFSUserAgent Will use the system
     timezone.

     The values in the defaults dictionary could be updated using the defaults
     cli as well.

KEYS
     The bundle keys are as follows:

           IncompatibleFeatures Mute notifications about either a volume or a
                   container that has features which are not supported with the
                   current running OS.

           HashMismatch Mute notification about volume hash mismatch.

           DontUnlockVolume Disable the DiskUnlock dialog to ask the user for
                   volume unlock password.

           MuteAllNotifications Mute all APFS notifications. Does not include
                   the dialog to unlock a volume.

EXAMPLE
     The following setting mutes the HashMismatch notification only for the
     volume with UUID F55502F4-1A9E-4B48-8A11-106E1226AE2F up to 2021-08-18
     15:10:31, and mutes the IncompatibleFeatures notification for any device,
     up to 2021-08-18 15:09:43

     ~ % defaults read com.apple.APFSUserAgent
     {
         "F55502F4-1A9E-4B48-8A11-106E1226AE2F" =     {
             HashMismatch = "2021-08-18 15:10:31";
         };
         IncompatibleFeatures = "2021-08-18 15:09:43";
     }
     ~ %

EXIT STATUS
     APFSUserAgent always exits with 0.
