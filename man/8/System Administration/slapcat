SLAPCAT(8C)                                                          SLAPCAT(8C)



NAME
       slapcat - SLAPD database to LDIF utility

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/slapcat [-afilter] [-bsuffix] [-c] [-ddebug-level]
       [-fslapd.conf] [-Fconfdir] [-g] [-HURI] [-lldif-file] [-ndbnum]
       [-ooption[=value]] [-ssubtree-dn] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       Slapcat is used to generate an LDAP Directory Interchange Format (LDIF)
       output based upon the contents of a slapd(8) database.  It opens the
       given database determined by the database number or suffix and writes the
       corresponding LDIF to standard output or the specified file.  Databases
       configured as subordinate of this one are also output, unless -g is
       specified.

       The entry records are presented in database order, not superior first
       order.  The entry records will include all (user and operational)
       attributes stored in the database.  The entry records will not include
       dynamically generated attributes (such as subschemaSubentry).

       The output of slapcat is intended to be used as input to slapadd(8).  The
       output of slapcat cannot generally be used as input to ldapadd(1) or
       other LDAP clients without first editing the output.  This editing would
       normally include reordering the records into superior first order and
       removing no-user-modification operational attributes.

OPTIONS
       -a_filter
              Only dump entries matching the asserted filter.  For example

              slapcat -a \
                  "(!(entryDN:dnSubtreeMatch:=ou=People,dc=example,dc=com))"

              will dump all but the "ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" subtree of the
              "dc=example,dc=com" database.  Deprecated; use -H
              ldap:///???(filter) instead.

       -b_suffix
              Use the specified suffix to determine which database to generate
              output for.  The -b cannot be used in conjunction with the -n
              option.

       -c     Enable continue (ignore errors) mode.  Multiple occorrences of -c
              make slapcat(8) try harder.

       -d_debug-level
              Enable debugging messages as defined by the specified debug-level;
              see slapd(8) for details.

       -f_slapd.conf
              Specify an alternative slapd.conf(5) file.

       -F_confdir
              specify a config directory.  If both -f and -F are specified, the
              config file will be read and converted to config directory format
              and written to the specified directory.  If neither option is
              specified, an attempt to read the default config directory will be
              made before trying to use the default config file. If a valid
              config directory exists then the default config file is ignored.

       -g     disable subordinate gluing.  Only the specified database will be
              processed, and not its glued subordinates (if any).

       -H  URI
              use dn, scope and filter from URI to only handle matching entries.

       -l_ldif-file
              Write LDIF to specified file instead of standard output.

       -n_dbnum
              Generate output for the dbnum-th database listed in the
              configuration file. The config database slapd-config(5), is always
              the first database, so use -n 0 to select it.

              The -n cannot be used in conjunction with the -b option.

       -o_option[=value]
              Specify an option with a(n optional) value.  Possible generic
              options/values are:

                     syslog=<subsystems>  (see `-s' in slapd(8))
                     syslog-level=<level> (see `-S' in slapd(8))
                     syslog-user=<user>   (see `-l' in slapd(8))

                     ldif-wrap={no|<n>}

       n is the number of columns allowed for the LDIF output
       (n equal to 0 uses the default, corresponding to 76).
       Use no for no wrap.

       -s_subtree-dn
              Only dump entries in the subtree specified by this DN.
              Implies -b subtree-dn if no
              -b
              or
              -n
              option is given.
              Deprecated; use -H ldap:///subtree-dn instead.

       -v     Enable verbose mode.

LIMITATIONS
       For some backend types, your slapd(8) should not be running (at least,
       not in read-write mode) when you do this to ensure consistency of the
       database. It is always safe to run slapcat with the slapd-bdb(5),
       slapd-hdb(5), and slapd-null(5) backends.

EXAMPLES
       To make a text backup of your SLAPD database and put it in a file called
       ldif, give the command:

            /usr/sbin/slapcat -l ldif
