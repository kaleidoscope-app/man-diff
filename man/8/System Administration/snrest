DESCRIPTION
       The snrest program supports control and status display for REST API
       access to the Xsan Volume.

       The snrest gateway commands support configuration and control of StorNext
       interactions with a single or multiple Quantum API Gateways.

       Commands with a <url> parameter may specify the url using only the
       hostname
        of the API Gateway.  If the protocol is not specified it defaults to
       https and if the port is not specified it defaults to 8443.  This allows
       the caller to only specify the hostname, as in the following example:

          snrest gateway admin-url <hostname>

       which is the same as explicitly specifying the following:

          snrest gateway admin-url https://<hostname>:8443

       The snrest gateway import command imports configuration information from
       a Quantum API Gateway.  This command takes a single argument which is a
       filename containing contact and authentication information and must be
       obtained from a Quantum API Gateway.

       Alternatively, the snrest gateway admin-url command is a simpler form for
       configuring access to the API Gateway.  Use this command only if your
       site has not configured site-specific authentication for gateway
       registration (in which case you must use snrest gateway import instead).

       With snrest gateway admin-url simply specify the URL of the API Gateway
       as a command line argument.

       The snrest gateway show command displays the API Gateway configuration.

       The snrest gateway remove [ <url> ] command unregisters with the API
       Gateway and removes the API Gateway from the configuration. If the url is
       specified, only the specified API Gateway is unregistered and removed.

       The snrest gateway register [ <url> ] command registers all the
       configured API Gateways.  API Gateways that are registered will continue
       to periodically retry until the registration succeeds.  This needs to be
       called if you use snrest gateway import or snrest gateway admin-url
       commands to add an API Gateway configuration to the configuration.

       An optional URL parameter may be specified to snrest gateway register.
       The following command:

          snrest gateway register <url>

       results in the same actions as if the following commands were issued:

          snrest gateway admin-url <url>
          snrest gateway register

       This allows the caller to configure the url and register with the API
       Gateway in a single command.  If the specified API Gateway has already
       been configured, the command performs only the registration.

       The snrest gateway unregister command unregisters with the currently
       registered API Gateways.  If the url is specified, only that API Gateway
       is unregistered.

       The snrest gateway status command displays the current status of the
       StorNext registrations with a Quantum API Gateway.  This typically
       reports that either all or none of the internal endpoints in StorNext are
       registered with a particular API Gateway..  But there is also the
       possibility, especially in transitory states or when connectivity to the
       API Gateway is problematic, that only a subset of the internal endpoints
       are registered.  If any endpoints are not currently registered the system
       will continue to try to register those endpoints until successful.

       There is an additional option to get extra detail on the registration
       status with the -d option.  This provides a detailed display of
       individual internal endpoints that register with the API Gateway and thus
       is primarily intended for use by Quantum Support.

       The snrest gateway ping command tests connectivity to the API Gateway.
       If the API Gateway cannot be contacted an error message is displayed and
       the command exits with a non-zero exit status.  By default, the following
       will ping the currently configured API Gateway:

          snrest gateway ping

       Alternatively, you can ping a specific URL with:

          snrest gateway ping <url>

       or use a file with the gateway configuration with the -f option:

          snrest gateway ping -f <filename>

       In this latter case the file specified would be of the same form used
       with snrest gateway import.

       The snrest config commands support setting values in the
       /Library/Preferences/Xsan/snfs_rest_config.json file.  These values
       should only be changed in consultation with Apple support.  The names are
       hierachical value separated by spaces.  For example, to change the
       ssl_enabled value under the ssl json object to true:

          snrest config set ssl.ssl_enabled=true

       To remove the ssl_enabled value:

          snrest config clear ssl.ssl_enabled

       Changes to the snrest config values will take effect the next time that
       StorNext is restarted.

       The snrest config show command displays the current values of the Xsan
       REST configuration.

EXIT VALUES
       snrest will return 0 on success and non-zero on failure.
