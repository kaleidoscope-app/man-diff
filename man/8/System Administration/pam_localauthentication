NAME
     pam_localauthentication – LocalAuthentication PAM module

SYNOPSIS
     [service-name] function-class control-flag pam_localauthentication
     [options]

DESCRIPTION
     The LocalAuthentication PAM module supports the authentication function
     class, function-class parameter is “auth”.

   The LocalAuthentication Authentication Module
     The LocalAuthentication authentication module permits or denies
     authentication based on LAContext policy evaluation.

     The module will try to create LAContext from the externalized blob returned
     by previous invocation of “LAContext.externalizedContext”.  The blob will
     be queried by pam_get_data(3) as data named “token_la”.

     When the LAContext instance is successfully created, the module will try to
     evaluate “LAPolicyDeviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics” on it with user
     interaction disabled. The expectation is that the policy was already
     successfully evaluated before. If so, then the authentication performed by
     this module will succeed as well.

     The following options may be passed to this authentication module:

     continuityunlock
             Use the alternative LAContext for AppleWatch unlock. The LAContext
             blob will be queried by pam_get_data(3) as data named
             “token_lacont” and the policy evaluated will be
             “LAPolicyContinuityUnlock”.
