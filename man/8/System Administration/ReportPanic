DESCRIPTION
     ReportPanic is an application that launches when a panic log is present in
     /var/db/PanicReporter. It is responsible to display the panic log to the
     users and in case they aren't opted into automatic Diagnostic and Usage
     data submission, it presents them with the option to send the current panic
     log to Apple. For internal users, it also offers a convenient shortcut for
     filing a Radar.
