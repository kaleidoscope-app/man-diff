SLAPINDEX(8C)                                                      SLAPINDEX(8C)



NAME
       slapindex - Reindex entries in a SLAPD database

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/sbin/slapindex [-b_suffix] [-c] [-d_debug-level] [-f_slapd.conf]
       [-F_confdir] [-g] [-n_dbnum] [-o_option[=value]] [-q] [-t] [-v]
       [attr[...]]

DESCRIPTION
       Slapindex is used to regenerate slapd(8) indices based upon the current
       contents of a database.  It opens the given database determined by the
       database number or suffix and updates the indices for all values of all
       attributes of all entries. If a list of specific attributes is provided
       on the command line, only the indices for those attributes will be
       regenerated.  Databases configured as subordinate of this one are also
       re-indexed, unless -g is specified.

       All files eventually created by slapindex will belong to the identity
       slapindex is run as, so make sure you either run slapindex with the same
       identity slapd(8) will be run as (see option -u in slapd(8)), or change
       file ownership before running slapd(8).

OPTIONS
       -b_suffix
              Use the specified suffix to determine which database to generate
              output for.  The -b cannot be used in conjunction with the -n
              option.

       -c     enable continue (ignore errors) mode.

       -d_debug-level
              enable debugging messages as defined by the specified debug-level;
              see slapd(8) for details.

       -f_slapd.conf
              specify an alternative slapd.conf(5) file.

       -F_confdir
              specify a config directory.  If both -f and -F are specified, the
              config file will be read and converted to config directory format
              and written to the specified directory.  If neither option is
              specified, an attempt to read the default config directory will be
              made before trying to use the default config file. If a valid
              config directory exists then the default config file is ignored.

       -g     disable subordinate gluing.  Only the specified database will be
              processed, and not its glued subordinates (if any).

       -n_dbnum
              Generate output for the dbnum-th database listed in the
              configuration file. The config database slapd-config(5), is always
              the first database, so use -n 0

              The -n cannot be used in conjunction with the -b option.

       -o_option[=value]
              Specify an option with a(n optional) value.  Possible generic
              options/values are:

                     syslog=<subsystems>  (see `-s' in slapd(8))
                     syslog-level=<level> (see `-S' in slapd(8))
                     syslog-user=<user>   (see `-l' in slapd(8))


       -q     enable quick (fewer integrity checks) mode. Performs no
              consistency checks when writing the database. Improves indexing
              time, however the database will most likely be unusable if any
              errors or interruptions occur.

       -t     enable truncate mode. Truncates (empties) an index database before
              indexing any entries. May only be used with Quick mode.

       -v     enable verbose mode.

LIMITATIONS
       Your slapd(8) should not be running (at least, not in read-write mode)
       when you do this to ensure consistency of the database.

       This command provides ample opportunity for the user to obtain and drink
       their favorite beverage.

EXAMPLES
       To reindex your SLAPD database, give the command:

            /usr/sbin/slapindex
       To regenerate the index for only a specific attribute, e.g. "uid", give
       the command:

            /usr/sbin/slapindex uid
