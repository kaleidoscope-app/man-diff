DESCRIPTION
       cvlabel is used when configuring the Xsan File System disks. One host
       that has visibility to all the storage area network disk devices must
       create a list of disk labels, their associated device names and
       optionally the sectors to use. The mount_acfs(8) process uses the volume
       labels to determine which disk drive is to be used for Xsan storage pool
       nodes. The label name that is written to a disk device must match the
       [Disk ...] name in the File System Manager (FSM) configuration. See
       snfs_config(5) for details of the FSM configuration file.

       It is recommended to first use cvlabel with the -l or -L option. This
       option will present all of the usable disk devices found on the system.
       It will try to identify the volume label and display the results. This
       will help determine what disk drives are visible to the client.

       The next step is to create the label_list file.  Use
       /System/Library/Filesystems/acfs.fs/Contents/examples/cvlabels.example as
       a template for your file.  Or, use cvlabel with the -c option, in which
       case cvlabel will write on stdout the list of all devices found in a
       format compatible with a label_list file.

       Once a label_list file has been generated it must be edited to match the
       desired Xsan label updates. All LUNs included in the label_list file that
       are not allocated to the Xsan File System should be removed from the
       label_list file to prevent accidental overwriting of existing data. Once
       all updates to the label_list are complete cvlabel should be run using
       this file to apply label changes to the indicated LUNs.

       A final option for creating a label file is to use the -C option with a
       format string.  This behaves the same as the -c option, except the format
       string is used to build template labels.  The format string uses a printf
       like syntax where % followed by a letter is replaced by information
       obtained from the storage.  The available format strings are %B size in
       sectors, %L lun number, %C controller id and %S serial number.  Care
       should be taken to use a format which generates unique names for devices
       before using the output to label them.

       Certain RAID devices require special handling.  Cvlabel uses the raid
       strings inquiry table to determine which devices require special
       handling.  The default table (displayed with the -R option), can be
       overridden by a user supplied file
       /Library/Preferences/Xsan/raid-strings.  Note: the -R option is not
       intended for general use and may be deprecated in the future.  Only use
       when recommended by Apple Support.

OPTIONS
       -l, -L Use the -l option (short format) or the -L option (long format) to
              list usable disk devices on the system.

       -j     Use the -j option (JSON format) to list usable disk devices on the
              system in a machine and human readable format.

       -u VolumeName
              Use the -u VolumeName option to unlabel the specified volume.

       -U DeviceName
              The -U DeviceName option is similar to the -u option, except that
              the path to the device special file is used instead of the label
              name.

       -s     When used in conjunction with the -l option, the -s option prints
              the disk device serial #, which can be used to distinguish the
              difference between duplicate labels and multiple paths.

       -g     When used in conjunction with the -l or -L options, the -g option
              also prints GUID information for EFI-labeled disks.  The GUID
              includes a timestamp and the MAC address of the node that created
              the label.

       -a     When used in conjunction with the -l or -L options, the -a option
              also prints unusable disk devices, along with a description of why
              they are unusable. This is usually due to a lack of OS support for
              large LUNs or an unsupported disk label format.

       -F filter
              When used in conjunction with the -c, -C, -l or -L options, the
              -F filter option will only list devices whose inquiry string
              contains the filter string.

       -v     The -v option prints more information about the labeling process.
              Multiple -v options accumulate, providing more information often
              used for debugging the label process.

       -q     The -q option can be used during labeling to set the Command Tag
              Queue Depth.  By default, the Depth is set to 16.

       -f     The -f option forces labeling and you will not be asked for
              confirmation before labeling (or unlabeling) a disk device.
              WARNING: errors in the Xsan label_list file can cause data loss.

       -c     The -c option outputs a cvlabel format template file to stdout.
              This template file will reflect all disk devices visible to the
              local system.  Use this template to build a cvlabel file. WARNING:
              Be sure to edit the template file to remove all devices which you
              do not want labeled.

       -T     The -T option can be used in conjunction with the -c option to
              facilitate conversion of labels from the old VTOC format to the
              new EFI format.  The output will be similar to the ordinary -c
              output, but devices that do not need conversion or cannot be
              safely converted will be output as comment lines, along with
              explanatory text.  Only convertible devices are output normally.

       -D VolumeName
              The -D VolumeName option can be used to dump the label for
              VolumeName in ascii to stdout.  Examining this output is useful
              when debugging labels.

       -r     The -r option can be used to force a disk to be relabeled, even if
              there are no changes to the label information. Normally such disks
              are skipped.

       -R     The -R option can be used to display the default raid strings
              inquiry table.  Note that EFI labels are not supported on IRIX
              systems for older releases of the Xsan File System.

       -i     The -i option is no longer supported.  Labels should be in EFI
              format.

       -w     The -w option tells cvlabel to wait for the completion of the disk
              scan that is requested after a disk label has been written or a
              volume has been unlabeled.  The disk scan requests that the file
              system server update its internal device tables and the -w option
              ensures that the operation has been completed.  Note that a disk
              scan may take a number of seconds on a large SAN or a SAN that is
              experiencing device errors.

          *WARNING* Use this program with extreme caution! Modifying a system
          disk's volume label may result in irreparable harm to your system. It
          may render the system inoperable and force you to repair the volume
          using the boot maintenance program. Only label disk devices which you
          are sure are to be used for the Xsan File System's storage area
          network.

FILE FORMAT
       You may use the
       /System/Library/Filesystems/acfs.fs/Contents/examples/cvlabels.example
       file as a template.

       A label entry consists of two or three parameters on a single line. White
       space and comment lines are allowed. Comment lines are designated by
       using a pound sign (#) as the first non-white space character of the
       line.

       The label_list file format is as follows:

          <Xsan_label_name> <operating_system_device_name> [<sectors> [<type>]]

       Where:

       <Xsan_label_name>

          The <Xsan_label_name> parameter is the name of the disk as described
          in the FSM configuration file. The parameter must match a [Disk
          <Xsan_label_name>] entry.

       <operating_system_device_name>

          The <operating_system_device_name> is the device name of the complete
          disk device.

          NOTE: operating system device names may change after reboots and will
          differ per system. Always configure Xsan label files, and label
          devices in the same session.

          On Windows systems, the devices start as PhysicalDrive0 and increment
          up to the number of drives configured.

       <sectors>

          The <sectors> parameter is the number in 512-byte sectors that matches
          the [DiskType ...] configuration in the FSM configuration file. This
          is required for disks that must be configured smaller than their
          actual size. For example, MPIRE video disks must be under-configured
          to eliminate using the last zone of the disk. If <sectors> is not
          specified or is specified as -, then the cvlabel(8) program will use
          the entire available volume.

        <type>
        .sp
        .in +0.3i
        The <type> parameter is used to override the default label type,
        or to change the label type for a disk that already has a label.
        The value must be EFI for changing a VTOC label to an
        EFI label.

EXAMPLES
       List all the disk devices in a system.

          rock # cvlabel -L

       Then create a template label file:

          rock # cvlabel -c >label_list

       The output file will include an entry for the 'unknown' disk:

          CvfsDisk_UNKNOWN /dev/mapper/mpathao # host 0 lun 3 sectors 18554669023 sector_size 512 inquiry [DotHill DH4730          H205] serial 600C0FF00019B6165E39A65801000000

       Edit the label_list file, changing CvfsDisk_UNKNOWN to the desired label
       name:

          CvfsDisk_39 /dev/mapper/mpathao

       Now label the disk devices. Your label_list file must be specified on the
       command line.

          rock # cvlabel label_list

          *WARNING* This program will over-write volume labels on the
                    devices specified in the file label_list.

                    After execution, the devices will only be usable by the
                    Xsan File System. You will have to re-partition the
                    devices to use them on a different file system.

NOTES
       Some operating systems require a reboot after a disk is labeled or
       relabeled. It is recommended that Xsan nodes are rebooted after new
       labels are written or existing labels are updated.
