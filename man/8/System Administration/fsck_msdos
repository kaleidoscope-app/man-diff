FSCK_MSDOS(8)                System Manager's Manual               FSCK_MSDOS(8)

NAME
     fsck_msdos – DOS/Windows (FAT) file system consistency check

SYNOPSIS
     fsck_msdos -q special ...
     fsck_msdos -p [-f] special ...
     fsck_msdos [-fny] special ...

DESCRIPTION
     The fsck_msdos utility verifies and repairs FAT file systems (more commonly
     known as DOS file systems).

     The first form of fsck_msdos quickly checks the specified file systems to
     determine whether they were cleanly unmounted.

     The second form of fsck_msdos preens the specified file systems.  It is
     normally started by fsck(8) run from /etc/rc.boot during automatic reboot,
     when a FAT file system is detected.  When preening file systems, fsck_msdos
     will fix common inconsistencies non-interactively.  If more serious
     problems are found, fsck_msdos does not try to fix them, indicates that it
     was not successful, and exits.

     The third form of fsck_msdos checks the specified file systems and tries to
     repair all detected inconsistencies, requesting confirmation before making
     any changes.  The default behavior is to always ask for confirmation of
     each change.  Use the -n or -y options to override this default behavior.

     The options are as follows:

           -q      Causes fsck_msdos to quickly check whether the volume was
                   unmounted cleanly.  If the volume was unmounted cleanly, then
                   the exit status is 0.  If the volume was not unmounted
                   cleanly, then the exit status will be non-zero.  In either
                   case, a message is printed to standard output describing
                   whether the volume was clean or dirty.

           -f      This option is ignored by fsck_msdos and is present only for
                   compatibility with programs that check other file system
                   types for consistency.

           -n      Causes fsck_msdos to assume no as the answer to all operator
                   questions, except “CONTINUE?”.

           -p      Preen the specified file systems.

           -y      Causes fsck_msdos to assume yes as the answer to all operator
                   questions.

EXIT VALUES
     fsck_msdos exits with a value of 0 when the filesystem is clean (or has
     been repaired), and 8 otherwise.

BUGS
     fsck_msdos is still under construction.
