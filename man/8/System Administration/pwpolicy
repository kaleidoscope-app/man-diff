   Account Policies
     Account policies are the replacement for the deprecated legacy global and
     user policies.  Account policies are specified as a dictionary containing
     three keys, one key for each policy category.  Note that the dictionary is
     not required to contain all of the policy categories.  Valid keys for the
     policy categories are:

     policyCategoryAuthentication     Controls when a user may
                                      login/authenticate.
     policyCategoryPasswordChange     Determines if/when a user is required to
                                      change their password
     policyCategoryPasswordContent    Controls the set of allowable characters
                                      in a password.

     Each policy category contains an array of individual policy dictionaries.
     Valid keys in the policy dictionary are:

     policyIdentifier     A user-defined unique identifier for the policy.

     policyParameters     An optional key that contains a dictionary of
                          parameters to be used in the policy or used for
                          display purposes.

     policyContent        The actual policy string, from which an NSPredicate
                          can be created. Any valid NSPredicate keyword may be
                          used, as well as certain parameters from the user's
                          record and the policy's parameters dictionary.

     Below is an example account policy dictionary.  Not all policy categories
     need be present in the dictionary.
