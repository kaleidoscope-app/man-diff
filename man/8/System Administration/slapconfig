NAME
     slapconfig -- tool to configure slapd and related daemons

SYNOPSIS
     slapconfig command [command-options] [-q]

DESCRIPTION
     slapconfig is a utility for configuring slapd. It must be run by root.

USAGE
     -q                    suppress prompts.

   Queries
     -defaultsuffix        Returns the default suffix which is based on the
                           machine's DNS name, or hostname if DNS is not
                           available.

     -getclientconfig      Returns whether this machine is an LDAP client, not a
                           client, or advanced.

     -getldapconfig        Returns the LDAP server settings.

     -getmacosxodpolicy    Returns a property list containing the directory
                           binding settings.

     -getmasterconfig      Returns the list of replicas and replication
                           interval.

     -getpasswordserveraddress
                           Returns the IP address of the default password
                           server.

     -getreplicaconfig     Returns the master address and last update date.

     -getstyle             Returns whether configuration is master, replica,
                           client, or standalone.

     -help                 Print usage information.

     -ver                  Displays version information.

   Setup
     -addreplica [--serverID num] [--guid D1C9C376-D940-404D-9941-7AD24E6A37DA]
     ⟨replica-address⟩
     Adds a replication link with the specified server.  The serverID and GUID
     of the remote machine you'd like to replicate with.  The serverID and GUID
     can be viewed in the target machine's computer record.  Replication links
     are unidirectional, the corresponding command should be run on the target
     server as well to get full replication working.  Caution should be
     exercised with this command, it is best to avoid replication loops.

     -changeip ⟨old-ip⟩ ⟨new-ip⟩ [⟨old-host⟩ ⟨new-host⟩]
     Updates configuration records and files to contain the new host
     information.  It does not change the IP address in Network preferences.

     -createldapmasterandadmin [--allow_local_realm] [--certAuthName ⟨Cert Auth
     Name⟩] [--certAdminEmail ⟨Cert Admin Email⟩] [--certOrgName ⟨Cert Org
     Name⟩] ⟨new-admin⟩ ⟨new-fullname⟩ ⟨new-uid⟩ [⟨search base suffix⟩
     [⟨realm⟩]]
     Creates a new master LDAP server. Copies the root account to the new master
     domain. Creates a new directory node administrator.

     -createreplica [--certAdminEmail ⟨Cert Admin Email⟩] ⟨master IP or name⟩
     ⟨admin user⟩
     Create a new replica from an existing LDAP master.

     -createrootcertauthority ⟨Certificate Authority Name⟩ ⟨Certificate
     Authority Admin Email⟩ ⟨Certificate Authority Organization Name⟩
     Create a CA on the OD master.

     -destroyldapserver [diradmin]
     Turns off the LDAP server and deletes its database.  The optional argument
     of the diradmin account name will then prompt for the diradmin password and
     will inform all replication peers of the server's destruction.

     -promotereplica ⟨admin-user⟩ ⟨archive-path⟩
     Converts an existing replica into a master using the current database. Path
     to an archive from the master can given in order to add the root CA's keys
     to the promoted master.

     -removereplica [--guid D1C9C376-D940-404D-9941-7AD24E6A37DA]
     -⟨replica-address⟩
     Removes a replication link with the specified server.  The GUID of the
     remote server being removed should be passed in with the --guid option.
     Replication links are unidirectional, so the corresponding command should
     be run on the target server to remove the other half of an existing
     replication link.

     -setclient
     Configures the machine to bind using DHCP if it is not already a client.

     -setldapconfig [-maxresults ⟨maximum search results⟩] [-searchtimeout
     timeout] [-ssl on|off] [-sslidentity ⟨identity name⟩] [-sslserialnumber
     ⟨certificate serial number⟩] [-sslsha1fingerprint ⟨certificate sha1
     fingerprint as a hex encoded colon separated string⟩]
     Applies the specified settings and restarts slapd. Settings not specified
     are unchanged.

     -setstandalone
     Configures the machine to only use the local directory.

     -setmacosxodpolicy [-binding [disabled|enabled|required] [] -cleartext
     [blocked|allowed] [] -encrypt [yes|no] [] -sign [yes|no] [] -clientcaching
     [yes|no] [] -man-in-middle [blocked|allowed]]
     Sets directory binding options.

     -startldapserver      Configures launchd to run slapd.

     -stopldapserver       Configures launchd not to run slapd.

     -updateaddresses      Merges new interfaces into the list of LDAP replicas.

   Password Server
     -startpasswordserver  Sets up a launchd plist file and starts the password
                           server.

     -stoppasswordserver   Sets the launchd plist file to be disabled and stops
                           the password server.

   Runtime
     -enableslapdlog       Turns on the LDAP server logging to
                           /var/log/slapd.log.

     -setfullsyncmode [yes | no]
                           The LDAP server defaults to running in a "full sync
                           mode" to ensure database transactions are fully
                           flushed to disk.  This improves data integrity in the
                           event of a power loss, but can result in slower
                           performance when importing large datasets.  Setting
                           this option to no disables this functionality
                           temporarily in order to speed up large imports.
                           After the import has been completed, this option
                           should be set back to yes for normal operation.

   Backup and Restore
     -backupdb ⟨archive-path⟩
     Creates an archive containing the LDAP, Password Server and Kerberos
     databases. It also contains Certificate Authority related data.

     -restoredb ⟨archive-path⟩
     Restores a directory to the backed-up state.

ENVIRONMENT
     The environment variable SSOUtilDebugLevel can be set to change the
     verbosity of the log.  Valid values are [0-9]. The default value is 1.

FILES
     /usr/sbin/slapconfig
