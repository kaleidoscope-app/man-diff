opendirectoryd(8)            System Manager's Manual           opendirectoryd(8)

NAME
     opendirectoryd – is a launchd(8) job for client access to local or remote
     directory systems

SYNOPSIS
     opendirectoryd [--version]

DESCRIPTION
     opendirectoryd is a launchd(8) job which replaces "DirectoryService" as a
     core part of the Open Directory technology. Several modules are provided
     that allow access to existing directory systems:

           •   Active Directory
           •   LDAP
           •   Local Database
           •   NIS

   Modules
     opendirectoryd modules have specific capabilities:

           Authentication  password verification, password changes, etc.
           Connection      general connections used for queries, record
                           modifications, etc.
           Discovery       location and prioritization of servers to contact
                           (a.k.a., service discovery)
           Unspecified     a generic module used for unspecified purpose
                           (usually to extend capabilities)

     Third party plugins developed for "DirectoryService" are supported via
     dspluginhelperd(8).

   Open Directory
     Open Directory is a technology which includes a client API abstraction
     layer, a directory server, and the opendirectoryd daemon.  This allows
     clients to utilize a single API to access a variety of directory servers
     simultaneously or configure their own directory server.

     Open Directory forms the foundation of how Mac OS X accesses all
     authoritative configuration information (users, groups, mounts, managed
     desktop data, etc.).  This allows use of virtually any directory system via
     Apple and third party modules.

     Configuration of opendirectoryd is done via "System Preferences" under the
     "Users & Groups" preference pane. Advanced settings are available by using
     "Open Directory Utility..." within "Users & Groups" preference pane.

     More information is available from the Open Directory website:

         http://developer.apple.com/darwin/projects/opendirectory/

   Open Directory Server
     Open Directory Server utilizes OpenLDAP which is included as part of Mac OS
     X Client, Mac OS X Server, and Darwin. OpenLDAP provides a robust and
     scalable platform for serving directory-based information for both
     standalone and networked systems.

   NFSv4 Domain name
     The following will set the default domain name used to map user and group
     identities in NFSv4 client/server operations.

     dscl . -create Config/NFSv4Domain RealName <Example.com>

     This command requires root privileges.

     Files are stored in various locations for opendirectoryd depending on use.
     A list of folders and files are shown below.

   System files provided by Apple and should only change with operating system
   updates:
