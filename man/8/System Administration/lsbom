LSBOM(8)                     System Manager's Manual                    LSBOM(8)




NAME
     lsbom â€“ list contents of a bom file

SYNOPSIS
     lsbom [-b] [-c] [-d] [-f] [-l] [-m] [-s] [-x] [--arch archVal]
           [-p parameters] bom ...
     lsbom -h | --help

DESCRIPTION
     The lsbom command interprets the contents of binary bom (bom(5)) files. For
     each file in a bom, lsbom prints the file path and/or requested
     information.

     If no options are given, lsbom will display the output formatted such that
     each line contains the path of the entry, its mode (octal), and its
     UID/GID. There are slight differences in the output for plain files,
     directories, symbolic links, and device files as follows:

     plain files     the UID/GID is followed by the file size and a 32-bit CRC
                     checksum of the file's contents.

     symbolic links  the UID/GID is followed by the size and checksum of the
                     link path, and the link path itself.

     device files    the UID/GID file number is followed by the device number.

     The -p option can be used to specify a user-defined format for lsbom's
     output. The format string consists of one or more characters described
     below where each character represents a data type. Data types will be
     separated by tab characters, and each line will end with a newline
     character. One can use this mechanism to create output similar to the ls(1)
     command.

     The options are:

     -h              print full usage

     -b              list block devices

     -c              list character devices

     -d              list directories

     -f              list files

     -l              list symbolic links

     -m              print modified times (for plain files only)

     -s              print only the path of each file

     -x              suppress modes for directories and symlinks

     --arch archVal  when displaying plain files that represent Universal Mach-O
                     binaries, print the size and checksum of the file contents
                     for the specified archVal (either "ppc", "ppc64", or
                     "i386")

     -p parameters   print only some of the results Note: each option can only
                     be used once:
                           c       32-bit checksum
                           f       file name
                           F       file name with quotes (i.e. "/mach_kernel")
                           g       group id
                           G       group name
                           m       file mode (permissions)
                           M       symbolic file mode (i.e. "dr-xr-xr-x" )
                           s       file size
                           S       formatted size
                           t       mod time
                           T       formatted mod time
                           u       user id
                           U       user name
                           /       user id/group id
                           ?       user name/group name

EXAMPLES
     lsbom bomfile           list the contents of bomfile

     lsbom -s bomfile        list only the paths of the contents of the bomfile

     lsbom -f -l bomfile     list the plain files and symbolic links of the
                             bomfiles (but not directories or devices)

     lsbom -p MUGsf bomfiles
                             list the contents of bomfile displaying only the
                             files' modes, user name, group name, size, and
                             filename

HISTORY
     The lsbom command appeared in NeXTSTEP as a tool to browse the contents of
     bom files used during installation.

     The -p flag appeared in Mac OS X 10.1 in an attempt to make lsbom's output
     more convenient for human beings.
