NFSIOD(8)                    System Manager's Manual                   NFSIOD(8)

NAME
     nfsiod â€“ local NFS asynchronous I/O

SYNOPSIS
     nfsiod [-n num_threads]

DESCRIPTION
     nfsiod is deprecated.  See nfs.conf(5) for NFS configuration info.

     nfsiod controls the maximum number of asynchronous I/O threads used for NFS
     mounts.  Historically, it has consisted of a daemon that never exits.
     However, asynchronous I/O requests are now serviced by threads launched on
     demand in the kernel and the nfsiod command simply sets the configuration
     limit.

     Having asynchronous I/O threads improves performance but is not required
     for correct operation.

     The options are as follows:

     -n      Specify maximum number of asynchronous I/O threads to be used.

     If no maximum is specified, nfsiod displays the current value.  The default
     value is 16.  A client should allow enough threads to handle its maximum
     level of concurrency.

     The nfsiod utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

HISTORY
     The nfsiod utility first appeared in 4.4BSD.  It's use was deprecated in
     Darwin 9.
