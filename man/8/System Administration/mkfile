MKFILE(8)                    System Manager's Manual                   MKFILE(8)

NAME
     mkfile â€“ create a file

SYNOPSIS
     mkfile [-nv] size[b|k|m|g] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     mkfile creates one or more files that are suitable for use as NFS-mounted
     swap areas.  The sticky bit is set, and the file is padded with zeroes by
     default.  Non-root users must set the sticky bit using chmod(1).  The
     default size unit is bytes, but the following suffixes may be used to
     multiply by the given factor: b (512), k (1024), m (1048576), and g
     (1073741824).

OPTIONS
     -n     Create an empty filename.  The size is noted, but disk blocks aren't
            allocated until data is written to them.

     -v     Verbose.  Report the names and sizes of created files.

WARNING
     If a client's swap file is removed and recreated, it must be re-exported
     before the client will be able to access it.  This action may only be done
     when the client is not running.

SEE ALSO
     chmod(2), stat(2), sticky(7)
