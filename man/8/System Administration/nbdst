NBDST(8)                     System Manager's Manual                    NBDST(8)

NAME
     nbdst â€“ NetBoot deferred shadow tool

SYNOPSIS
     nbdst [-recycle | -preallocate size] devnode shadowfile

DESCRIPTION
     nbdst is used during NetBoot to associate a shadow file with the disk image
     being used as the root device. After the shadow file is attached,
     subsequent writes to the root device will be redirected to the shadow file,
     which normally resides on local storage.  nbdst is invoked by
     /etc/rc.netboot

ARGUMENTS
     The following arguments must be specified:
     devnode        The device node of the root device, in the form "disk0"
     shadowfile     Path to a shadow file which will be created and associated
                    with the NetBoot root device

OPTIONS
     -recycle  If a shadow file already exists, reset it and use it again.
               Otherwise, information written to an existing shadow file will
               reappear.  Reusing a previous shadow file without resetting it
               requires that the shadow file be created with the same base
               image.

     -preallocate size
               Set the shadow file to the given size up front.  This forces a
               reset of the shadow file (like -recycle).

NOTE
     nbdst can only be run as root.
