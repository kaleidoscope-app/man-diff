QUOTAON(8)                   System Manager's Manual                  QUOTAON(8)

NAME
     quotaon, quotaoff â€“ turn filesystem quotas on and off

SYNOPSIS
     quotaon [-g] [-u] [-v] filesystem ...
     quotaon [-g] [-u] [-v] -a
     quotaoff [-g] [-u] [-v] filesystem ...
     quotaoff [-g] [-u] [-v] -a

DESCRIPTION
     Quotaon announces to the system that disk quotas should be enabled on one
     or more filesystems.  Quotaoff announces to the system that the specified
     filesystems should have disk quotas turned off.  The filesystem must be
     mounted and it must have the appropriate mount option file located at its
     root, the .quota.ops.user file for user quota configuration, and the
     .quota.ops.group file for group quota configuration.  Quotaon also expects
     each filesystem to have the appropriate quota data files located at its
     root, the .quota.user file for user data, and the .quota.group file for
     group data.  These filenames and their root location cannot be overridden.
     By default, quotaon will attempt to enable both user and group quotas.  By
     default, quotaoff will disable both user and group quotas.

     Available options:

     -a      If the -a flag is supplied in place of any filesystem names,
             quotaon/quotaoff will enable/disable any filesystems with an
             existing mount option file at its root.  The mount option file
             specifies the types of quotas that are to be configured.

     -g      Only group quotas will be enabled/disabled.  The mount option file,
             .quota.ops.group, must exist at the root of the filesystem.

     -u      Only user quotas will be enabled/disabled.  The mount option file,
             .quota.ops.user, must exist at the root of the filesystem.

     -v      Causes quotaon and quotaoff to print a message for each filesystem
             where quotas are turned on or off.

     Specifying both -g and -u is equivalent to the default.

     Quotas for both users and groups will automatically be turned on at
     filesystem mount if the appropriate mount option file and binary data file
     is in place at its root.

FILES
     Each of the following quota files is located at the root of the mounted
     filesystem.  The mount option files are empty files whose existence
     indicates that quotas are to be enabled for that filesystem.

     .quota.user       data file containing user quotas
     .quota.group      data file containing group quotas
     .quota.ops.user   mount option file used to enable user quotas
     .quota.ops.group  mount option file used to enable group quotas
