SNCFGTRANSFORM(8)            System Manager's Manual           SNCFGTRANSFORM(8)



NAME
       sncfgtransform - Check two Xsan Volume configuration files for a valid
       transformation

SYNOPSIS
       sncfgtransform [-h] -n VolName caller file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
       The sncfgtransform program will validate the transformation between two
       Xsan file system configuration files for the given "caller" and file
       system.

       The valid caller values are:

       fsm    The transform is checked for a file system manager (fsm) restart.
              This is the usual transform that administrators are looking for
              since a change in the config file is usually followed by a file
              system restart.

       cvupdatefs
              The transform is checked for a run of the cvupdatefs command.
              This can be used when adding a stripe group or for stripe group
              expansion.

       updatefs
              Same as cvupdatefs.

       cvfsck The transform is checked for a run of cvfsck.

       dbg    The transform is checked for the cvfsdb command.

       cvntfscfg
              The transform is checked with config files in ASCII format,
              typically used only on Windows MDCs.

       snadmin
              The transform is checked with callers of the snadmin library API.

       cvmkfs The transform is checked for the cvmkfs command.

       cvmkfsr
              The transform is checked for the cvmkfs command with the -r option
              which means that the file system meta data is being restored from
              a database created because the restore journal was configured.

       convert
              The transform is checked for the sncfgconvert command.

       fsmpm  The transform is checked for the fsmpm utility.

       mdarchive
              The transform is checked for the snhistory and snaudit commands
              and other logic that interacts with the metadata archive.

       cfggen The transform is checked for the sncfggen command.

       dcap   The transform is checked for the disk capacity license logic.

       sgmanage
              The transform is checked for sgmanage and other stripe group
              management commands.

       validate
              The transform is checked for the sncfgvalidate command.

       Two configurations files must be given and the transformation is assumed
       to be from file1 to file2.

       Each configuration file is parsed and may fail.  If they both succeed
       parsing, the transformation is checked with any errors being displayed.

OPTIONS
       -h     Display usage.

       -n VolName
              Required. The name of the file system whose config files are
              given.

EXIT VALUES
       sncfgtransform will return 0 on success and non-zero on failure.

EXAMPLES
       List usage:

          # sncfgtransform -h
          Usage: sncfgtransform [-h] -n <fsname> <caller> <file1> <file2>
            -h        This usage
            -n        Name of file system to validate
            caller
                  fsm
                  cvfsck
                  cvmkfs
                  cvmkfsr
                  dbg
                  cvntfscfg
                  snadmin
                  sncfgconvert
                  fsmpm
                  cvupdatefs
                  updatefs
                  mdarchive
                  cfggen
                  dcap
                  sgmange
                  validate
            file1     current configuration file
            file2     proposed configuration file

       Check a new config file under consideration for snfs1 with a copy in /tmp
       (OK):

          # sncfgtransform -n snfs1 fsm /tmp/snfs1.cfgx /tmp/snfs1.new.cfgx
          'snfs1' transformation OK

       Check a new config file under consideration for cvupdatefs of snfs1 (OK):

          # sncfgtransform -n snfs1 updatefs /tmp/snfs1.cfgx /tmp/snfs1.new.cfgx
          'snfs1' transformation OK

       Check a modified config against the installed config (with a valid change
       for cvupdatefs))


             # sncfgtransform -n snfs1 updatefs /Library/Preferences/Xsan/snfs1.cfgx /tmp/cfgx
             'snfs1' transformation OK

       Check a modified config against the installed config (with an invalid
       change)

          # sncfgtransform -n snfs1 fsm /tmp/snfs1.cfgx /tmp/snfs1.new.cfgx
          transformation failed for /tmp/snfs1.cfgx -> /tmp/snfs1.new.cfgx with -1
          transformation for /tmp/snfs1.cfgx -> /tmp/snfs1.new.cfgx -- error: Stripe group metadata field changed at index 2 - mkfs required

          ./sncfgtransform transformation failed
