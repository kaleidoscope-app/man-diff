NSS_CCTL_TEMPLATE(8)         System Manager's Manual        NSS_CCTL_TEMPLATE(8)



NAME
       Central control facility template generator

SYNOPSIS
       na

       nss_cctl_template [-h] [--host HOST] [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       nss_cctl_template  is a utility to create an initial configuration file
       for the central control facility.  It uses the snprobe command to scan
       the existing cluster as seen from the host it is run on and generates an
       initial nss_cctl.xml file.  The output is a permissive version of the
       control file with all features enabled.  This can be used as a basis for
       a version which restricts the type of access allowed for different
       clients.  The output needs to be placed in /usr/cvfs/config/nss_cctl.xml
       on the cluster name server hosts.  Output defaults to stdout unless a
       file name is specified.

       By default the cluster is scanned from the local host, this can be
       overridden using the --host option.
