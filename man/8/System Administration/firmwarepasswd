NAME
     firmwarepasswd â€“ tool for setting and removing firmware passwords on a
     system

SYNOPSIS
     firmwarepasswd [-setpasswd] [-setmode mode [-allow-oroms]] [-mode] [-check]
                    [-delete] [-verify] [-unlockseed]
                    [-disable-reset-capability] [-enable-reset-capability] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
     The firmwarepasswd command is used to add or remove firmware passwords from
     a system as well as check status and other options.  The firmwarepasswd
     command requires root privileges to run.

     A list of flags and their descriptions:

     -setpasswd
             Prompts to add a new firmware password or change and existing
             password if one exists.

     -setmode mode [-allow-oroms]
             Set the mode to "command" or "full".  "Command" will prompt for the
             firmware password if the user attempts to boot from a different
             volume.  "Full" will prompt on every startup (not recommended).
             Optional "allow-oroms" flag will permit option roms execution, that
             is denied by default once firmware password is set.

     -mode   Displays the current mode if one is set.

     -check  Displays whether or not a firmware password is set.

     -delete
             Prompts for password and clears both password and the mode if
             correct.

     -verify
             Prompts for password and displays success if correct.

     -unlockseed
             Generates a firmware password recovery key.  Note: Machine must be
             stable for this command to generate a valid seed.  No pending
             changes that need a restart.  NOTE: Seed is only valid until the
             next time a firmware password command runs.

     -disable-reset-capability
             Disables firmware password reset using unlockseed.

     -enable-reset-capability
             Enables firmware password reset using unlockseed.

     -h      Displays a list of all the commands available in the firmwarepasswd
             tool, with explanatory information.
