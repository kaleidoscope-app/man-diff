VIFS(8)                      System Manager's Manual                     VIFS(8)

NAME
     vifs â€“ safely edit fstab

SYNOPSIS
     vifs

DESCRIPTION
     The vifs utility simply locks the fstab file before invoking an editor on
     it.  This is important to facilitate the modification of fstab by automated
     tools and system management software.

     Always use vifs to edit fstab, instead of invoking an editor directly.

SEE ALSO
     vi(1), fstab(5)

HISTORY
     The vifs utility originates from Mac OSX 10.5.
