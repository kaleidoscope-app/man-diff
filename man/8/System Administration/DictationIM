NAME
     DictationIM â€“ Implements system-wide Dictation and command & control.

DESCRIPTION
     DictationIM is an Input Method-based process that implements the UI portion
     of the system-wide Dictation feature in macOS. This process registers the
     appropriate set of spoken commands with the embedded speech recognition
     engine for the current state of the UI then responds to any recognized
     commands by performing the expected action. Control over when this process
     is launched is primarily governed by the Input Method system.
