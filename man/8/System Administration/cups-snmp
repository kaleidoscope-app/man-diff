NAME
       snmp - cups snmp backend (deprecated)

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/lib/cups/backend/snmp ip-address-or-hostname
       /usr/libexec/cups/backend/snmp ip-address-or-hostname
       lpinfo -v --include-schemes snmp

DESCRIPTION
       The DEPRECATED CUPS SNMP backend provides legacy discovery and
       identification of network printers using SNMPv1.  When used for discovery
       through the scheduler, the backend will list all printers that respond to
       a broadcast SNMPv1 query with the "public" community name.  Additional
       queries are then sent to printers that respond in order to determine the
       correct device URI, make and model, and other information needed for
       printing.

       In the first form, the SNMP backend is run directly by the user to look
       up the device URI and other information when you have an IP address or
       hostname.  This can be used for programs that need to configure print
       queues where the user has supplied an address but nothing else.

       In the second form, the SNMP backend is run indirectly using the
       lpinfo(8) command.  The output provides all printers detected via SNMP on
       the configured broadcast addresses.  Note: no broadcast addresses are
       configured by default.

ENVIRONMENT
       The DebugLevel value can be overridden using the CUPS_DEBUG_LEVEL
       environment variable.  The MaxRunTime value can be overridden using the
       CUPS_MAX_RUN_TIME environment variable.

FILES
       The SNMP backend reads the /etc/cups/snmp.conf configuration file, if
       present, to set the default broadcast address, community name, and
       logging level.

NOTES
       The CUPS SNMP backend is deprecated and will no longer be supported in a
       future version of CUPS.

CONFORMING TO
       The CUPS SNMP backend uses the information from the Host, Printer, and
       Port Monitor MIBs along with some vendor private MIBs and intelligent
       port probes to determine the correct device URI and make and model for
       each printer.
