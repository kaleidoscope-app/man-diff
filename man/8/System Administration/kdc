NAME
     kdc – Kerberos 5 server

SYNOPSIS
     kdc [-c file | --config-file=file] [-p | --no-require-preauth]
         [--max-request=size] [-H | --enable-http] [--no-524] [--kerberos4]
         [--kerberos4-cross-realm] [-r string | --v4-realm=string]
         [-K | --kaserver] [-P portspec | --ports=portspec] [--detach]
         [--disable-des] [--addresses=list of addresses]

DESCRIPTION
     kdc serves requests for tickets.  When it starts, it first checks the flags
     passed, any options that are not specified with a command line flag are
     taken from a config file, or from a default compiled-in value.

     Options supported:

     -c file, --config-file=file
             Specifies the location of the config file, the default is
             /var/heimdal/kdc.conf.  This is the only value that can't be
             specified in the config file.

     -p, --no-require-preauth
             Turn off the requirement for pre-autentication in the initial AS-
             REQ for all principals.  The use of pre-authentication makes it
             more difficult to do offline password attacks.  You might want to
             turn it off if you have clients that don't support pre-
             authentication.  Since the version 4 protocol doesn't support any
             pre-authentication, serving version 4 clients is just about the
             same as not requiring pre-athentication.  The default is to require
             pre-authentication.  Adding the require-preauth per principal is a
             more flexible way of handling this.

     --max-request=size
             Gives an upper limit on the size of the requests that the kdc is
             willing to handle.

     -H, --enable-http
             Makes the kdc listen on port 80 and handle requests encapsulated in
             HTTP.

     --no-524
             don't respond to 524 requests

     --kerberos4
             respond to Kerberos 4 requests

     --kerberos4-cross-realm
             respond to Kerberos 4 requests from foreign realms.  This is a
             known security hole and should not be enabled unless you understand
             the consequences and are willing to live with them.

     -r string, --v4-realm=string
             What realm this server should act as when dealing with version 4
             requests.  The database can contain any number of realms, but since
             the version 4 protocol doesn't contain a realm for the server, it
             must be explicitly specified.  The default is whatever is returned
             by krb_get_lrealm().  This option is only available if the KDC has
             been compiled with version 4 support.

     -K, --kaserver
             Enable kaserver emulation (in case it's compiled in).

     -P portspec, --ports=portspec
             Specifies the set of ports the KDC should listen on.  It is given
             as a white-space separated list of services or port numbers.

     --addresses=list of addresses
             The list of addresses to listen for requests on.  By default, the
             kdc will listen on all the locally configured addresses.  If only a
             subset is desired, or the automatic detection fails, this option
             might be used.

     --detach
             detach from pty and run as a daemon.

     --disable-des
             disable add des encryption types, makes the kdc not use them.

     All activities are logged to one or more destinations, see krb5.conf(5),
     and krb5_openlog(3).  The entity used for logging is kdc.

CONFIGURATION FILE
     The configuration file has the same syntax as krb5.conf(5), but will be
     read before /etc/krb5.conf, so it may override settings found there.
     Options specific to the KDC only are found in the “[kdc]” section.  All the
     command-line options can preferably be added in the configuration file.
     The only difference is the pre-authentication flag, which has to be
     specified as:

           require-preauth = no

     (in fact you can specify the option as --require-preauth=no).

     And there are some configuration options which do not have command-line
     equivalents:

           enable-digest = boolean
                turn on support for digest processing in the KDC.  The default
                is FALSE.

           check-ticket-addresses = boolean
                Check the addresses in the ticket when processing TGS requests.
                The default is TRUE.

           allow-null-ticket-addresses = boolean
                Permit tickets with no addresses.  This option is only relevant
                when check-ticket-addresses is TRUE.

           allow-anonymous = boolean
                Permit anonymous tickets with no addresses.

           max-kdc-datagram-reply-length = number
                Maximum packet size the UDP rely that the KDC will transmit,
                instead the KDC sends back a reply telling the client to use TCP
                instead.

           transited-policy = always-check | allow-per-principal |
                always-honour-request
                This controls how KDC requests with the disable-transited-check
                flag are handled. It can be one of:

                      always-check
                           Always check transited encoding, this is the default.

                      allow-per-principal
                           Currently this is identical to always-check.  In a
                           future release, it will be possible to mark a
                           principal as able to handle unchecked requests.

                      always-honour-request
                           Always do what the client asked.  In a future
                           release, it will be possible to force a check per
                           principal.

           encode_as_rep_as_tgs_rep = boolean
                Encode AS-Rep as TGS-Rep to be bug-compatible with old DCE code.
                The Heimdal clients allow both.

           kdc_warn_pwexpire = time
                How long before password/principal expiration the KDC should
                start sending out warning messages.

     The configuration file is only read when the kdc is started.  If changes
     made to the configuration file are to take effect, the kdc needs to be
     restarted.

     An example of a config file:

           [kdc]
                   require-preauth = no
                   v4-realm = FOO.SE

BUGS
     If the machine running the KDC has new addresses added to it, the KDC will
     have to be restarted to listen to them.  The reason it doesn't just listen
     to wildcarded (like INADDR_ANY) addresses, is that the replies has to come
     from the same address they were sent to, and most OS:es doesn't pass this
     information to the application.  If your normal mode of operation require
     that you add and remove addresses, the best option is probably to listen to
     a wildcarded TCP socket, and make sure your clients use TCP to connect.
     For instance, this will listen to IPv4 TCP port 88 only:

           kdc --addresses=0.0.0.0 --ports="88/tcp"

     There should be a way to specify protocol, port, and address triplets, not
     just addresses and protocol, port tuples.
