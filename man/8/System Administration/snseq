NAME
       snseq - Xsan cvdb "perf" trace analyzer

SYNOPSIS
       snseq {read,write,rdwr} {--persec,--details,--csv} [filer_options]
       files(s)

       snseq devread file(s)

       snseq devwrite file(s)

       snseq -h, --help

DESCRIPTION
       snseq is a tool for analyzing cvdb "perf" traces. It is useful for
       determining file access patterns of applications as well as measuring I/O
       latency and performance at both VFS and device levels.

       Running snseq first requires capturing client traces using the cvdb
       command.  snseq emits to "stdout" so capturing output to a file requires
       shell redirection.

       By default, snseq displays a human-readable ASCII format. However, some
       snseq command lines allow the specification of --csv that will cause it
       to emit CSV format that can be used with spreadsheet applications.  This
       is especially useful for producing graphs. Visualizing data in this
       manner can provide insight into how an application is performing I/O.


OPTIONS
       Analysis mode:

       read   Process VFS reads.

       write  Process VFS writes.

       rdwr   Process VFS reads and writes.

       devread
              Process device reads.

       devwrite
              Process device writes.

       filter_options:

       --seq  track largest sequential I/O stream

       --start
              start time offset

       --end  end time offset

       --proc filter by process name

       --minsize
              filter out files smaller than byte_count

       help:

       -h, --help
              Just display help and exit


EXAMPLE
              # mkdir /tmp/cvdb
              # cd /tmp/cvdb
              # cvdbset perf
              # cvdb -g -C -F &
              test is run here
              # killall cvdb
              # snseq read --details cvdbout* > seq.out

NOTES
       snseq uses python. If for some reason the Python package available on the
       system is incompatible with snseq, installing an additional Python
       package may be required to run snseq. Alternatively, cvdb "perf" traces
       captured on one system can often be processed on another system.  It is
       often possible to capture cvdb perf traces on a client and then copy them
       over to the MDC and run snseq there. This technique can also be used to
       process perf traces taken from a backrev client, subject to certain
       limitations. For example, older cvdb perf traces do not contain enough
       information to display file names.
