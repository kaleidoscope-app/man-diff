INTRO(8)                     System Manager's Manual                    INTRO(8)

NAME
     intro â€“ introduction to system maintenance procedures and commands

DESCRIPTION
     This section contains information related to system operation and
     maintenance.

     It describes commands used to create new file systems (newfs(8)), verify
     the integrity of the file systems (fsck(8)), control disk usage
     (edquota(8)), maintain system backups (dump(8)), and recover files when
     disks die an untimely death (restore(8)).  Network related services like
     ftpd(8) are also described.

     All commands set an exit status.  Its value may be tested to see if the
     command completed normally.  Unless otherwise noted (rare), the value 0
     signifies successful completion of the command, while a value >0 indicates
     an error.  Some commands attempt to describe the nature of the failure by
     using error codes defined in sysexits(3), or set the status to arbitrary
     values >0 (typically 1), but many such values are not described in the
     manual.

HISTORY
     The intro section manual page appeared in 4.2BSD.
