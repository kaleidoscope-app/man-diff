PWD_MKDB(8)                  System Manager's Manual                 PWD_MKDB(8)

NAME
     pwd_mkdb â€“ generate the password databases

SYNOPSIS
     pwd_mkdb [-c] [-p | -s] [-d directory] [-u username] file

DESCRIPTION
     The pwd_mkdb utility creates db(3) style secure and insecure databases for
     the specified file.  These databases are then installed into /etc/spwd.db
     and /etc/pwd.db respectively.  The file is installed into
     /etc/master.passwd.  The file must be in the correct format (see
     passwd(5)).  It is important to note that the format used in this system is
     different from the historic Version 7 style format.

     The options are as follows:

     -c      Check if the password file is in the correct format.  Do not
             change, add, or remove any files.

     -d directory
             Operate in a base directory other than the default of /etc.  All
             absolute paths (including file) will be made relative to directory.
             Any directories specified as a part of file will be stripped off.
             This option is used to create password databases in directories
             other than etc; for instance in a chroot(8) jail.

     -p      Create a Version 7 style password file and install it into
             /etc/passwd.

     -s      Only update the secure version of the database.  This is most
             commonly used in conjunction with the -u flag during a password
             change.  Because the insecure database doesn't contain the password
             there is no reason to update it if the only change is in the
             password field.  Cannot be used in conjunction with the -p flag.

     -u username
             Only update the record for the specified user.  Utilities that
             operate on a single user can use this option to avoid the overhead
             of rebuilding the entire database.  This option must never be used
             if the line number of the user's record in /etc/master.passwd has
             changed.

     file    The absolute path to a file in master.passwd format, as described
             in passwd(5).

     The two databases differ in that the secure version contains the user's
     encrypted password and the insecure version has an asterisk (``*'')

     The databases are used by the C library password routines (see
     getpwent(3)).

     The pwd_mkdb utility exits zero on success, non-zero on failure.

FILES
     /etc/pwd.db                       The insecure password database file.
     /etc/pwd.db.tmp                   A temporary file.
     /etc/spwd.db                      The secure password database file.
     /etc/spwd.db.tmp                  A temporary file.
     /etc/master.passwd                The current password file.
     /etc/passwd                       A Version 7 format password file.

COMPATIBILITY
     Previous versions of the system had a program similar to pwd_mkdb,
     mkpasswd(8), which built dbm(3) style databases for the password file but
     depended on the calling programs to install them.  The program was renamed
     in order that previous users of the program not be surprised by the changes
     in functionality.

SEE ALSO
     chpass(1), passwd(1), db(3), getpwent(3), passwd(5), vipw(8)

BUGS
     Because of the necessity for atomic update of the password files, pwd_mkdb
     uses rename(2) to install them.  This, however, requires that the file
     specified on the command line live on the same file system as the /etc
     directory.

     There are the obvious races with multiple people running pwd_mkdb on
     different password files at the same time.  The front-ends to pwd_mkdb,
     chpass(1), passwd(1) and vipw(8), handle the locking necessary to avoid
     this problem.
