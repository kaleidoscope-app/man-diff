NAME
       lpadmin - configure cups printers and classes

SYNOPSIS
       lpadmin [ -E ] [ -U username ] [ -h server[:port] ] -d destination
       lpadmin [ -E ] [ -U username ] [ -h server[:port] ] -p destination [ -R
       name-default ] option(s)
       lpadmin [ -E ] [ -U username ] [ -h server[:port] ] -x destination

DESCRIPTION
       lpadmin configures printer and class queues provided by CUPS.  It can
       also be used to set the server default printer or class.

       When specified before the -d, -p, or -x options, the -E option forces
       encryption when connecting to the server.

       The first form of the command (-d) sets the default printer or class to
       destination.  Subsequent print jobs submitted via the lp(1) or lpr(1)
       commands will use this destination unless the user specifies otherwise
       with the lpoptions(1) command.

       The second form of the command (-p) configures the named printer or
       class.  The additional options are described below.

       The third form of the command (-x) deletes the printer or class
       destination.  Any jobs that are pending for the destination will be
       removed and any job that is currently printed will be aborted.

OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized when configuring a printer queue:

       -c class
            Adds the named printer to class.  If class does not exist it is
            created automatically.

       -m model
            Sets a standard PPD file for the printer from the model directory or
            using one of the driver interfaces.  Use the -m option with the
            lpinfo(8) command to get a list of supported models.  The model
            "raw" clears any existing PPD file and the model "everywhere"
            queries the printer referred to by the specified IPP device-uri.
            Note: Models other than "everywhere" are deprecated and will not be
            supported in a future version of CUPS.

       -o cupsIPPSupplies=true

       -o cupsIPPSupplies=false
            Specifies whether IPP supply level values should be reported.

       -o cupsSNMPSupplies=true

       -o cupsSNMPSupplies=false
            Specifies whether SNMP supply level (RFC 3805) values should be
            reported.

       -o job-k-limit=value
            Sets the kilobyte limit for per-user quotas.  The value is an
            integer number of kilobytes; one kilobyte is 1024 bytes.

       -o job-page-limit=value
            Sets the page limit for per-user quotas.  The value is the integer
            number of pages that can be printed; double-sided pages are counted
            as two pages.

       -o job-quota-period=value
            Sets the accounting period for per-user quotas.  The value is an
            integer number of seconds; 86,400 seconds are in one day.

       -o job-sheets-default=banner

       -o job-sheets-default=banner,banner
            Sets the default banner page(s) to use for print jobs.

       -o name=value
            Sets a PPD option for the printer.  PPD options can be listed using
            the -l option with the lpoptions(1) command.

       -o name-default=value
            Sets a default server-side option for the destination.  Any print-
            time option can be defaulted, e.g., "-o number-up-default=2" to set
            the default "number-up" option value to 2.

       -o port-monitor=name
            Sets the binary communications program to use when printing, "none",
            "bcp", or "tbcp".  The default program is "none".  The specified
            port monitor must be listed in the printer's PPD file.

       -o printer-error-policy=name
            Sets the policy for errors such as printers that cannot be found or
            accessed, don't support the format being printed, fail during
            submission of the print data, or cause one or more filters to crash.
            The name must be one of "abort-job" (abort the job on error),
            "retry-job" (retry the job at a future time), "retry-current-job"
            (retry the current job immediately), or "stop-printer" (stop the
            printer on error).  The default error policy is "stop-printer" for
            printers and "retry-current-job" for classes.

       -o printer-is-shared=true

       -o printer-is-shared=false
            Sets the destination to shared/published or unshared/unpublished.
            Shared/published destinations are publicly announced by the server
            on the LAN based on the browsing configuration in cupsd.conf, while
            unshared/unpublished destinations are not announced.  The default
            value is "true".

       -o printer-op-policy=name
            Sets the IPP operation policy associated with the destination.  The
            name must be defined in the cupsd.conf in a Policy section.  The
            default operation policy is "default".

       -R name-default
            Deletes the named option from printer.

       -r class
            Removes the named printer from class.  If the resulting class
            becomes empty it is removed.

       -u allow:{user|@group}{,user|,@group}*

       -u deny:{user|@group}{,user|,@group}*

       -u allow:all

       -u deny:none
            Sets user-level access control on a destination.  Names starting
            with "@" are interpreted as UNIX groups.  The latter two forms turn
            user-level access control off.  Note: The user 'root' is not granted
            special access - using "-u allow:foo,bar" will allow users 'foo' and
            'bar' to access the printer but NOT 'root'.

       -v "device-uri"
            Sets the device-uri attribute of the printer queue.  Use the -v
            option with the lpinfo(8) command to get a list of supported device
            URIs and schemes.

       -D "info"
            Provides a textual description of the destination.

       -E   When specified before the -d, -p, or -x options, forces the use of
            TLS encryption on the connection to the scheduler.  Otherwise,
            enables the destination and accepts jobs; this is the same as
            running the cupsaccept(8) and cupsenable(8) programs on the
            destination.

       -L "location"
            Provides a textual location of the destination.

DEPRECATED OPTIONS
       The following lpadmin options are deprecated:

       -i filename
            This option historically has been used to provide either a System V
            interface script or (as an implementation side-effect) a PPD file.
            Note: Interface scripts are not supported by CUPS.  PPD files and
            printer drivers are deprecated and will not be supported in a future
            version of CUPS.

       -P ppd-file
            Specifies a PostScript Printer Description (PPD) file to use with
            the printer.  Note: PPD files and printer drivers are deprecated and
            will not be supported in a future version of CUPS.

CONFORMING TO
       Unlike the System V printing system, CUPS allows printer names to contain
       any printable character except SPACE, TAB, "/", or "#".  Also, printer
       and class names are not case-sensitive.

       Finally, the CUPS version of lpadmin may ask the user for an access
       password depending on the printing system configuration.  This differs
       from the System V version which requires the root user to execute this
       command.

NOTES
       CUPS printer drivers and backends are deprecated and will no longer be
       supported in a future feature release of CUPS.  Printers that do not
       support IPP can be supported using applications such as ippeveprinter(1).

       The CUPS version of lpadmin does not support all of the System V or
       Solaris printing system configuration options.

       Interface scripts are not supported for security reasons.

       The double meaning of the -E option is an unfortunate historical oddity.

       The lpadmin command communicates with the scheduler (cupsd) to make
       changes to the printing system configuration.  This configuration
       information is stored in several files including printers.conf and
       classes.conf.  These files should not be edited directly and are an
       implementation detail of CUPS that is subject to change at any time.

EXAMPLE
       Create an IPP Everywhere print queue:

           lpadmin -p myprinter -E -v ipp://myprinter.local/ipp/print -m everywhere
