DESCRIPTION
     The systemsetup command is used to configure certain per-machine settings
     typically configured in the System Preferences application.  The
     systemsetup command requires at least "admin" privileges to run.

     A list of flags and their descriptions:

     -getdate
             Displays the current date.

     -setdate mm:dd:yy
             Use this command to set the current month, day, and year.

     -gettime
             Displays the current time in 24-hour format.

     -settime hh:mm:ss
             Sets the current time.  The provided time argument should be in
             24-hour format.

     -gettimezone
             Displays current time zone.

     -listtimezones
             Lists all time zones supported by this machine.

     -settimezone timezone
             Use this command to set the local time zone.  Use "-listtimezones"
             to list valid timezone arguments.

     -getusingnetworktime
             Displays whether network time is on or off.

     -setusingnetworktime on | off
             Sets whether using network time is on or off.

     -getnetworktimeserver
             Displays the currently set network time server.

     -setnetworktimeserver timeserver
             Use this command to designate a network time server.  Enter the IP
             address or DNS name for the network time server.

     -getsleep
             Displays amount of idle time until machine sleeps.

     -setsleep minutes
             Sets amount of idle time until computer sleeps.  Specify "Never" or
             "Off" for computers that should never sleep.  Important: if you set
             the system to sleep, you will not be able to administer the server
             remotely while it is sleeping.

     -getcomputersleep
             Display amount of idle time until computer sleeps.

     -setcomputersleep minutes
             Set amount of idle time until computer sleeps.  Specify "Never" or
             "Off" for never.

     -getdisplaysleep
             Display amount of idle time until display sleeps.

     -setdisplaysleep minutes
             Set amount of idle time until display sleeps.  Specify "Never" or
             "Off" for never.

     -getharddisksleep
             Display amount of idle time until hard disk sleeps.  Specify
             "Never" or "Off" for never.

     -setharddisksleep minutes
             Set amount of idle time until hard disk sleeps.  Specify "Never" or
             "Off" for never.

     -getwakeonmodem
             Displays whether wake on modem is on or off.

     -setwakeonmodem on | off
             Use this command to specify whether or not the server will wake
             from sleep when modem activity is detected.

     -getwakeonnetworkaccess
             Displays whether wake on network access is on or off.

     -setwakeonnetworkaccess on | off
             Use this command to specify whether the server wakes from sleep
             when a network admin packet is sent to it.

     -getrestartpowerfailure
             Displays whether restart on power failure is on or off.

     -setrestartpowerfailure on | off
             Use this command to specify whether the server automatically
             restarts after a power failure.

     -getrestartfreeze
             Displays whether restart on freeze is on or off.

     -setrestartfreeze on | off
             Use this command to specify whether the server restarts
             automatically after the system freezes.

     -getallowpowerbuttontosleepcomputer
             Enable or disable whether the power button can sleep the computer.

     -setallowpowerbuttontosleepcomputer on | off
             Enable or disable whether the power button can sleep the computer.

     -getremotelogin
             Displays whether remote login (SSH) is on or off.

     -setremotelogin [-f] on | off
             Sets remote login (SSH) to either on or off.  Requires Full Disk
             Access privileges.  Important: If you turn off remote login, you
             won't be able to administer the server using remote command line
             tools and SSH.  To turn remote login back on, you'll need to
             connect a monitor and keyboard to the server to administer it
             locally.  Use "setremotelogin -f off" to suppress prompting when
             turning remote login off.

     -getremoteappleevents
             Displays whether remote apple events are on or off.

     -setremoteappleevents on | off
             Use this command to set whether the server responds to events sent
             by other computers (such as AppleScripts). Requires Full Disk
             Access privileges.

     -getcomputername
             Displays computer name.

     -setcomputername computername
             Sets computer name to <computername>. This name is used by AFP.

             Display local subnet name.

     -setlocalsubnetname name
             Set local subnet name to <name>.

     -getstartupdisk
             Displays current startup disk.

     -liststartupdisks
             Lists all valid startup disks on this computer.

     -setstartupdisk path
             Sets current startup disk to the indicated path.  Valid arguments
             can be listed using "-liststartupdisks."

     -getwaitforstartupafterpowerfailure
             Get the number of seconds after which the computer will start up
             after a power failure.

     -setwaitforstartupafterpowerfailure seconds
             Set the number of seconds after which the computer will start up
             after a power failure.  The <seconds> value must be a multiple of
             30 seconds.

     -getdisablekeyboardwhenenclosurelockisengaged
             Get whether or not the keyboard should be disabled when the X Serve
             enclosure lock is engaged.

     -setdisablekeyboardwhenenclosurelockisengaged yes | no
             Set whether or not the keyboard should be disabled when the X Serve
             enclosure lock is engaged.

     -getkernelbootarchitecturesetting
             Gets the Kernel Architecture setting from the com.apple.Boot.plist.

     -setkernelbootarchitecture i386 | x86_64 | default
             Set the kernel to boot in 32 or 64 bit mode on next boot. default
             removes the setting.

     -version
             Displays version of systemsetup tool.

     -help   Displays a list of all the commands available in the System Setup
             Tool, with explanatory information.

     -printCommands
             Displays a list of commands with no detail.
