RPC.LOCKD(8)                 System Manager's Manual                RPC.LOCKD(8)

NAME
     rpc.lockd â€“ NFS file locking daemon

SYNOPSIS
     rpc.lockd [-d debug_level] [-g grace_period] [-x host_monitor_cache_period]

DESCRIPTION
     The rpc.lockd utility provides monitored and unmonitored file and record
     locking services in an NFS environment.  To monitor the status of hosts
     requesting locks, the locking daemon typically operates in conjunction with
     rpc.statd(8).

     The rpc.lockd utility runs whenever its services are needed to support
     either the NFS server (see nfsd(8)) or the NFS client (an NFS file system
     on which file locking requests have been made).  The daemon will remain
     running until a short time after its services are no longer needed to
     support either the NFS client or NFS server.  rpc.lockd will also make sure
     that the statd service (on which it depends) is running.

     The following is a list of command line options that are available.
     However, since rpc.lockd is normally started by launchd(8), configuration
     of these options should be controlled using the equivalent settings in the
     NFS configuration file.  See nfs.conf(5) for a list of tunable parameters.

     -d      The -d option causes debugging information to be written to syslog,
             recording all RPC transactions to the daemon.  These messages are
             logged with level LOG_DEBUG and facility LOG_DAEMON.  Specifying a
             debug_level of 1 results in the generation of one log line per
             protocol operation.  Higher debug levels can be specified, causing
             display of operation arguments and internal operations of the
             daemon.

     -g      The -g option allows to specify the grace period (in seconds).
             During the grace period rpc.lockd only accepts requests from hosts
             which are reinitialising locks which existed before the server
             restart.  Default is 45 seconds.

     -x      The -x option tells rpc.lockd how long to cache state records for
             monitored hosts.  Setting it to zero will disable the cache which
             will make lock and unlock requests from a single client more
             expensive because of additional interaction with the client's
             statd.  The default cache time is 60 seconds.

     Error conditions are logged to syslog, irrespective of the debug level,
     using log level LOG_ERR and facility LOG_DAEMON.

BUGS
     The current implementation serialises locks requests that could be shared.
