NAME
     pam_env – The Environment PAM module

SYNOPSIS
     [service-name] function-class control-flag pam_env [options]

DESCRIPTION
     The Environment PAM module supports the authentication and session
     management function classes.  In terms of the function-class parameter,
     these are “auth” and “session” respectively.  The Environment PAM module
     has identical support for both supported function classes.

     The Environment PAM module allows the setting and unsetting of environment
     variables.  The use of previously set environment variables as well as
     PAM_ITEMs such as PAM_RHOST is supported.

     This module can also parse a file with simple KEY=VAL pairs on separate
     lines (/etc/environment by default).  You can change the default file to
     parse, with the envfile flag and turn it on or off by setting the readenv
     flag to 1 or 0 respectively.

     The following options may be passed to this module:

     conffile=/path/to/pam_env.conf
             Indicate an alternative pam_env.conf style configuration file to
             override the default. This can be useful when different services
             need different environments.

     debug   A lot of debug information will be printed to the system log.

     envfile=/path/to/environment
             Indicate an alternative environment file to override the default.
             This can be useful when different services need different
             environments.

     readenv=0|1
             Turns on or off the reading of the file specified by envfile (0 is
             off, 1 is on). By default this option is on.

FILES
     /etc/security/pam_env.conf
             The default configuration file.

     /etc/environment
             The default environment file.
