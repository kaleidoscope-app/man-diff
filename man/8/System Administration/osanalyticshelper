NAME
     osanalyticshelper â€“ Writes JetsamEvent reports

DESCRIPTION
     osanalyticshelper reads JetsamEvent information from the system and writes
     it into a JetsamEvent report on disk.  The JetsamEvent reports are intended
     to help performance engineers diagnose memory issues and are submitted
     anonymously to Apple by the SubmitDiagInfo process.  The reports are used
     by Apple to improve its products.  Users who need support should use
     http://www.apple.com/support or other authorized support channels.
     Developers who are ADC members should report bugs using
     http://bugreporter.apple.com in order to allow for two way communication
     between Apple and the bug reporter.
