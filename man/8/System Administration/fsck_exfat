NAME
     fsck_exfat â€“ Verify and repair ExFAT file systems.

SYNOPSIS
     fsck_exfat -q device ...
     fsck_exfat [-f] [-p] [-y | -n] [-g | -x] [-S -path_prefix] [-d] device ...

DESCRIPTION
     The fsck_exfat utility verifies and repairs ExFAT file systems.

     The first form of fsck_exfat quickly checks the specified file systems to
     determine whether they were cleanly unmounted.

     The second form of fsck_exfat checks the specified file systems and tries
     to repair all detected problems, requesting confirmation before making any
     changes.  The default behavior is to always ask for confirmation of each
     change.  Use the -n or -y options to override this default behavior.

     The device parameter(s) should be a path to a "raw" disk device (a
     character special device), such as /dev/rdisk1s1.  If you specify a "non-
     raw" path (a block special device) such as /dev/disk1s1, or just the disk
     name such as disk1s1, they will automatically be converted to the
     corresponding raw disk device (/dev/rdisk1s1).

     The options are as follows:

           -q      Causes fsck_exfat to quickly check whether the volume was
                   unmounted cleanly.  If the volume was unmounted cleanly, then
                   the exit status is 0.  If the volume was not unmounted
                   cleanly, then the exit status will be non-zero.  In either
                   case, a message is printed to standard output describing
                   whether the volume was clean or dirty.

           -f      This option is ignored by fsck_exfat and is present only for
                   compatibility with programs that check other file system
                   types for consistency.

           -p      Preen the specified file systems.  This option is ignored by
                   fsck_exfat and is present only for compatibility with
                   programs that check other file system types for consistency.

           -y      Causes fsck_exfat to assume yes as the answer to all
                   questions.  It will attempt to repair all problems that are
                   found.

           -n      Causes fsck_exfat to assume no as the answer to all
                   questions.  The device will be opened read-only, and no
                   repairs will be made.

           -g      Causes fsck_exfat to produce its output in GUI-compatible
                   form.  Each message is printed as a tuple containing the kind
                   of message, the message string, and number of parameters to
                   the message string.  Any parameters to the message string are
                   printed on subsequent lines.  The message string uses NSLog-
                   like substitutions.  This output format is used by
                   applications such as Disk Utility.

           -x      Causes fsck_exfat to produce its output in an XML-like form.
                   Each message is printed as a plist(5) containing a message
                   type, verbosity, message number, and message string.  The
                   message string uses NSLog-like substitutions.  For message
                   strings that contain parameters, an array of dictionaries is
                   output.  This output format is used by applications such as
                   Disk Utility.  It may be used by other kinds of applications
                   which wish to parse the output of fsck_exfat.

           -d      Causes fsck_exfat to produce extra debugging output.  This
                   generally contains additional details about problems found.
                   When writing bug reports for fsck_exfat, it is usually
                   helpful to include the output generated from this option.

           -S path_prefix Causes fsck_exfat to create a shadow file containing
                   all metadata read from the device. This functionality is
                   intended for inclusion with bug reports regarding excpetional
                   problems. One file is created for each checked device. A
                   shadow file's name is created by taking path_prefix,
                   appending a - character, and then appending the basename of
                   the device being checked. For instance, given a path_prefix
                   of ./metadata, a check of disk /dev/rdisk3s1 would create the
                   shadow file ./metadata-rdisk3s1.  Note that the shadow file
                   captures all metadata as read from disk. In some cases with
                   large volumes, fsck_exfat will limit its cache size and re-
                   read metadata from disk at different phases of the repair
                   process. If the repair process has repaired the metadata, the
                   shadow file will capture its state as last read from disk.
                   For optimal debug value, the shadow file should be captured
                   in conjunction with the -n option. This file will be created
                   as a sparse file, if it is on a file system supporting sparse
                   files, such as APFS.  The shadow file does not capture file
                   contents. However be aware the shadow file includes details
                   about all current and some past files. Extreme care should be
                   taken before sharing the shadow file with others.
