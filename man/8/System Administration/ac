NAME
     ac â€“ display connect-time accounting

SYNOPSIS
     ac [-d] [-p] [-w file] [users ...]

DESCRIPTION
     A record of individual login and logout times are written to the system log
     by login(8) and launchd(8), respectively.  The program ac examines these
     records and writes the accumulated connect time (in decimal hours) for all
     logins to the standard output.

     Options available:

     -d      Display the connect times in 24 hour chunks.

     -p      Display individual user totals.

     -w file
             Read raw connect time data from file, instead of the system log.

     users ...
             Display totals for the given individuals only.

     If no arguments are given, ac displays the total amount of login time for
     all active accounts on the system.
