AC(8)                        System Manager's Manual                       AC(8)

NAME
     ac â€“ connect time accounting

SYNOPSIS
     ac [-dp] [-t tty] [-w wtmp] [users ...]

DESCRIPTION
     By default, a record of individual login and logout times are recorded by
     login(1) and init(8), respectively to syslogd(8).  The ac utility examines
     these records and writes the accumulated connect time (in hours) for all
     logins to the standard output.

     The options are as follows:

     -d         Display the connect times in 24 hour chunks.

     -p         Print individual users' totals.

     -t tty     Only do accounting logins on certain ttys.  The tty
                specification can start with '!' to indicate not this tty and
                end with '*' to indicate all similarly named ttys.  Multiple -t
                flags may be specified.

     -w wtmp    Read connect time data from wtmp instead of the default, reading
                from the log(1).

     users ...  Display totals for the given individuals only.

     If no arguments are given, ac displays the total connect time for all
     accounts with login sessions recorded in log(1).

FILES
     /var/run/utmpx    connect time accounting file

EXIT STATUS
     The ac utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Allow times recorded in modems to be charged out at a different rate than
     other:

           ac -p -t "ttyd*" > modems
           ac -p -t "!ttyd*" > other

     An ac command appeared in Version 5 AT&T UNIX.  This version of ac was
     written for NetBSD 0.9A from the specification provided by various systems'
     manual pages.
