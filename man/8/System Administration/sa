NAME
     sa – print system accounting statistics

SYNOPSIS
     sa [-abcdDfijkKlmnqrstu] [-P file] [-U file] [-v cutoff] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The sa utility reports on, cleans up, and generally maintains system
     accounting files.

     The sa utility is able to condense the information in /var/account/acct
     into the summary files /var/account/savacct and /var/account/usracct, which
     contain system statistics according to command name and login id,
     respectively.  This condensation is desirable because on a large system,
     /var/account/acct can grow by hundreds of blocks per day.  The summary
     files are normally read before the accounting file, so that reports include
     all available information.

     If file names are supplied, they are read instead of /var/account/acct.
     After each file is read, if the summary files are being updated, an updated
     summary will be saved to disk.  Only one report is printed, after the last
     file is processed.

     The labels used in the output indicate the following, except where
     otherwise specified by individual options:

     avio   Average number of I/O operations per execution

     cp     Sum of user and system time, in minutes

     cpu    Same as cp

     k      CPU-time averaged core usage, in 1k units

     k*sec  CPU storage integral, in 1k-core seconds

     re     Real time, in minutes

     s      System time, in minutes

     tio    Total number of I/O operations

     u      User time, in minutes

     The options to sa are:

     -a      List all command names, including those containing unprintable
             characters and those used only once.  By default, sa places all
             names containing unprintable characters and those used only once
             under the name ``***other''.

     -b      If printing command statistics, sort output by the sum of user and
             system time divided by number of calls.

     -c      In addition to the number of calls and the user, system and real
             times for each command, print their percentage of the total over
             all commands.

     -d      If printing command statistics, sort by the average number of disk
             I/O operations.  If printing user statistics, print the average
             number of disk I/O operations per user.

     -D      If printing command statistics, sort and print by the total number
             of disk I/O operations.

     -f      Force no interactive threshold comparison with the -v option.

     -i      Do not read in the summary files.

     -j      Instead of the total minutes per category, give seconds per call.

     -k      If printing command statistics, sort by the cpu-time average memory
             usage.  If printing user statistics, print the cpu-time average
             memory usage.

     -K      If printing command statistics, print and sort by the cpu-storage
             integral.

     -l      Separate system and user time; normally they are combined.

     -m      Print per-user statistics rather than per-command statistics.

     -n      Sort by number of calls.

     -P file
             Use the specified file for accessing the per-command accounting
             summary database, instead of the default /var/account/savacct.

     -q      Create no output other than error messages.

     -r      Reverse order of sort.

     -s      Truncate the accounting files when done and merge their data into
             the summary files.

     -t      For each command, report the ratio of real time to the sum of user
             and system cpu times.  If the cpu time is too small to report,
             ``*ignore*'' appears in this field.

     -U file
             Use the specified file for accessing the per-user accounting
             summary database, instead of the default /var/account/usracct.

     -u      Superseding all other flags, for each entry in the accounting file,
             print the user ID, total seconds of cpu usage, total memory usage,
             number of I/O operations performed, and command name.

     -v cutoff
             For each command used cutoff times or fewer, print the command name
             and await a reply from the terminal.  If the reply begins with
             ``y'', add the command to the category ``**junk**''.  This flag is
             used to strip garbage from the report.

     By default, per-command statistics will be printed.  The number of calls,
     the total elapsed time in minutes, total cpu and user time in minutes,
     average number of I/O operations, and CPU-time averaged core usage will be
     printed.  If the -m option is specified, per-user statistics will be
     printed, including the user name, the number of commands invoked, total cpu
     time used (in minutes), total number of I/O operations, and CPU storage
     integral for each user.  If the -u option is specified, the uid, user and
     system time (in seconds), CPU storage integral, I/O usage, and command name
     will be printed for each entry in the accounting data file.

     If the -u flag is specified, all flags other than -q are ignored.  If the
     -m flag is specified, only the -b, -d, -i, -k, -q, and -s flags are
     honored.

FILES

     /var/account/usracct  per-user accounting summary database

EXIT STATUS
     The sa utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

CAVEATS
     While the behavior of the options in this version of sa was modeled after
     the original version, there are some intentional differences and
     undoubtedly some unintentional ones as well.  In particular, the -q option
     has been added, and the -m option now understands more options than it used
     to.

     The formats of the summary files created by this version of sa are very
     different from the those used by the original version.  This is not
     considered a problem, however, because the accounting record format has
     changed as well (since user ids are now 32 bits).

BUGS
     The number of options to this program is absurd, especially considering
     that there is not much logic behind their lettering.

     The field labels should be more consistent.

     The VM system does not record the CPU storage integral.
