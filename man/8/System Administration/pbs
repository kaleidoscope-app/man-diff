NAME
     pbs â€“ general helper tool

SYNOPSIS
     pbs [-debug] [-dump] [-read_bundle PATH] [-flush] [-update] language1
         language2 ...

DESCRIPTION
     pbs is an agent for the Services menu.  It scans for and vends available
     Services, to populate the Services menu.

     pbs is NOT related to the pasteboard.  The pasteboard is managed by the
     pboard agent.

     pbs normally runs the first time Services are needed in any login session.
     You may run it manually for debugging Services. If run without any options,
     pbs will scan for changed Services, cache them along with their English
     localization, and immediately update the Services menu in all running apps.
     It will also log about any invalid Services declarations in Info.plist.
     This is useful when developing or testing Services, because it immediately
     applies any changes.

     ServicesMenu.strings files for a localization are loaded only when an app
     running under that localization shows the Services menu.  You may pass pbs
     language codes (e.g. "fr") to cause it to load that localization
     immediately.

     pbs has additional options that are useful for debugging, in particular the
     -dump and -read_bundle options. The complete list of options is:

     -debug
         Output debugging information regarding what pbs is doing.

     -dump
         Prints the userdef cache of Services information.  pbs caches Services
         information in its userdefs to avoid scanning the entire system every
         boot.  Changed apps are still detected via FSEvents, so there is no
         need to flush the userdef cache when installing a new Service.

     -read_bundle PATH
         Prints the Services information for the given application or service
         bundle. Does not update the cache.

     -flush
         Erases the userdef cache, entirely resetting pbs. The next time
         Services information is needed, pbs will do a complete rescan for apps
         vending Services, and read their plist.  Note: this rescan may be very
         expensive!

     -update
         Updates the userdef cache. pbs will do a complete rescan for apps
         vending Services, and read their plist.

HISTORY
     First appeared in NextStep.  pbs has historically had responsibilities that
     ranged from pasteboard management to Unicode glyph generation, but now it
     only does Services.
