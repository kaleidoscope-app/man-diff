SNTPD(8)                     System Manager's Manual                    SNTPD(8)

NAME
     sntpd â€“ very Simple Network Time Protocol server daemon

SYNOPSIS
     launchctl enable system/com.apple.sntpd

     sntpd [-L] [-z state_file]

DESCRIPTION
     sntpd is an SNTP server daemon, which can provide time synchronization
     services to clients such as timed(8).

     The following options are available:

     -L      Overwrite any existing state with a header describing a stratum 1
             uncalibrated local clock.  This is useful for starting a root
             (primary) server that doesn't use sntp(1) to synchronize with a
             higher stratum server.

     -z state_file
             Specify where to get the header data from.

             When unspecified, the default location is state.bin in the current
             working directory.  When managed by launchd, the default system
             location is /var/sntpd/state.bin.

             If the file does not exist, it will be created and populated with a
             template indicating that the server is unsynchronized.
