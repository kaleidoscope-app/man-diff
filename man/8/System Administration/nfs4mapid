NFS4MAPID(8)                 System Manager's Manual                NFS4MAPID(8)

NAME
     nfs4mapid – shows NFSv4 mappings from uids or gids to over the wire string
     names and string names to uids or gids.

SYNOPSIS
     nfs4mapid [-G] string name
     nfs4mapid [-G] GUID
     nfs4mapid -u uid
     nfs4mapid -g gid

DESCRIPTION
     In the first form, nfs4mapid shows translations from NFSv4 string
     representations of users, and with the -G option, groups, to the
     corresponding local uids and gids.  In the second form shows the
     translations from opendirectoy GUIDS to NFSv4 strings. The well known
     strings names (which are distinguished by a trailing ‘@’ ), such as
     "OWNER@" and "GROUP@" are represented locally by GUIDs and may not map to
     uids or gids. To map those GUIDS to NFSv4 strings use this form. The first
     form can be used to map the well known ids to GUIDs.  nfs4mapid does this
     by looking at the trailing ‘@’ sign. Note that NFSv4 well known names are
     always groups and are used in ACEs.  In the third form, it shows the
     mapping from uids to the NFSv4 user@domain form.  Similarly, in the last
     form it shows the mapping from gids to the NFSv4 group@domain.  nfs4mapid
     will also show the intermediate GUID translation if used. The NFSv4 domain
     name should be set with dscl(1).  See opendirectory(8) for instructions.

     -G      Map an NFSv4 string to a gid.

     -u      Map a uid to an NFSv4 user@domain string.

     -g      Map a gid to an NFSv4 group@domain string.

NOTES
     nfs4mapid uses a privileged nfs client system call to pass the translation
     request down to the kernel, so results will be the same as a request coming
     from an NFSv4 server. Because of this, nfs4mapid must be run with root
     privileges.
