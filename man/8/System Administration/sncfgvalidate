SNCFGVALIDATE(8)             System Manager's Manual            SNCFGVALIDATE(8)



NAME
       sncfgvalidate - Validate a Xsan Volume configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       sncfgvalidate -n VolName [-f config_file] [-M msg_format]

       sncfgvalidate -h

DESCRIPTION
       The sncfgvalidate program will validate a Xsan file system configuration
       file.

       If only an VolName is specified, sncfgvalidate looks for an already
       installed configuration file for the named file system, and validates its
       syntax if it exists.

       If an VolName and a config_file are specified, the specified config
       file's internal syntax is validated, and it is compared against the
       currently installed configuration file for the named file system (if it
       exists).

OPTIONS
       -h     Display usage.

       -n VolName
              Required. The name of the file system whose config is to be
              validated.

       -f config_file
              Specify the config file to validate.

       -M msg_format
              Specify XML if you want messages to come back in XML format.  This
              defaults to ASCII.

EXIT VALUES
       sncfgvalidate will return 0 on success and non-zero on failure.

EXAMPLES
       List usage:

          # sncfgvalidate -h
          Usage: sncfgvalidate -n <fs_name> [-f <config_path>] [-M <fmt>]
            -f            Path to file to validate
            -n            Name of file system to validate
            -M            Message format: ASCII, XML (default ASCII)
            -h            This usage

       validate an installed config:

          # sncfgvalidate -n snfs1
          'snfs1' validated

       validate a new config

          # sncfgvalidate -n snfs2 -f /tmp/mysnfs2
          'snfs' validated

       validate a modified config against the installed config (with an invalid
       change)

          # sncfgvalidate -n snfs1 -f /tmp/mysnfs1
          warning: Journal Size of 16M is less than recommended minimum value; It must be at least 32M for mkfs to succeed with an fs blocksize of 32K
          warning: new fsBlockSize (32768) does not match existing fsBlockSize (16384), file system must be remade
