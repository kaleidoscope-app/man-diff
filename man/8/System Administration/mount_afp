MOUNT_AFP(8)                 System Manager's Manual                MOUNT_AFP(8)

NAME
     mount_afp â€“ mount an afp (AppleShare) filesystem

SYNOPSIS
     mount_afp [-i] [-s] [-k] [-o options] afp_url node

DESCRIPTION
     The mount_afp command mounts the AFP volume denoted by the afp_url
     afp://[user[;AUTH=uamname][:password]@]host[:port]/volumename at the mount
     point indicated by node.

     This command is normally executed by mount(8) when the -t afp option is
     used. If the -i option is not used, all the required information to
     establish a login to the remote server must be available in the afp URL,
     including username & password if needed.

     The arguments and options are:

     -i      Interactive mode, you are prompted for the password if you did not
             supply one in the url.

     -s      Soft mount (default).  Network errors, e.g. timeouts, will be
             retried for a much shorter amount of time.  If the network errors
             persist, then the mount will be force unmounted.

     -k      Hard mount.  Network errors, e.g. timeouts, will be retried for an
             extended amount of time.  If the network errors persist, then the
             mount will be force unmounted.

     -o      Options passed to mount(2) are specified with the -o option
             followed by a comma separated string of options. See the mount(8)
             man page for possible options and their meanings. Additional
             options supported by the AFP Client are as follows:

             nobrowse
                     Indicate to the Carbon subsystem that this volume is not to
                     be displayed to the user.

             automounted
                     Set flags on the mountpoint to indicate that the volume has
                     been mounted by the automounter.

     afp_url
             There are two forms of afp URL, one for TCP/IP and one for
             AppleTalk:

             afp://[user[;AUTH=uamname][:password]@]host[:port]/volume

             afp:/at/[user[;AUTH=uamname][:password]@]servername[:zonename]/volume

             Denotes the afp server and sharepoint to mount. It may also contain
             the username & password required to log into the server. uamname is
             the protocol name of the authentication method.  If port is not
             specified, then port 548 is used.

     node    Path to mount point, which must be a directory that the user has
             write permissions for.

EXAMPLES
     The following example illustrates how to mount the afp volume
     server.company.com/volumename/ at the mount point /Volumes/mntpnt:

           mkdir /Volumes/mntpnt
           mount_afp afp://username:userpass@server.company.com/volumename/ /Volumes/mntpnt

     This example shows the proper url to use to mount the volume guestVolume
     from the afp server myserver as guest (if no uam and no username, then use
     guest uam):

           mkdir /Volumes/guest
           mount_afp "afp://myserver/guestVolume" /Volumes/guest

     This example shows the proper url to use to mount the volume myVolume from
     the afp server myserver using Kerberos authentication:

           mkdir /Volumes/myVolume
           mount_afp "afp://;AUTH=Client%20Krb%20v2@myserver/myVolume" /Volumes/myVolume

HISTORY
     The mount_afp command first appeared Mac OS X version 10.0. Kerberos
     authentication was added in Mac OS X version 10.2

RETURN VALUES
     0                  mount_afp successfully mounted the volume directory.

     [ENODEV (19)]      The server volume could not be mounted by mount_afp
                        because the server was not found or because the
                        sharepoint does not exist, or because node does not have
                        proper access.

     [EACCES (13)]      The volume could not be mounted by mount_afp because the
                        user did not provide proper authentication credentials.

     [ENOTDIR (20)]     The volume could not be mounted by mount_afp because the
                        mountpoint was not a directory.
