SNQBMD(8)                    System Manager's Manual                   SNQBMD(8)



NAME
       snqbmd - Xsan QBM Client Daemon

SYNOPSIS
       snqbmd

DESCRIPTION
       The snqbmd is the server daemon that collects I/O bandwidth statistics
       and forwards the information to the MDC.  The daemon monitors stornext
       mount points.  When a mount point is determined to have QoS bandwidth
       management active on the MDC, this daemon will send updates to the fsm
       via the <mountpt>/.__snfsqos directory.

       snqbmd logs to /Library/Logs/Xsan/debug/snqbmd.log for debugging
       purposes.

       The file /Library/Logs/Xsan/debug/snqbmd.verbose can be used to increase
       logging for snqbmd.  Place a numerical value between 0 and 4 in the file
       to change the debug verbosity.  The default value is 1.  The snqbmd
       daemon must be restarted to make the change effective.  This can be done
       using the cvadmin restartd command.

OPTIONS
       This process runs in the background and is started at boot time as part
       of the stornext startup process.
