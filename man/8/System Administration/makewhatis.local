MAKEWHATIS.LOCAL(8)          System Manager's Manual         MAKEWHATIS.LOCAL(8)

NAME
     makewhatis.local â€“ start makewhatis for local file systems

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/libexec/makewhatis.local [options] directories ...

DESCRIPTION
     The makewhatis.local utility starts makewhatis(8) only for file systems
     physically mounted on the system where the makewhatis.local is being
     executed.  Running makewhatis by periodic weekly for rw nfs-mounted /usr
     may kill your NFS server -- all NFS clients start makewhatis at the same
     time!  So use this wrapper for cron(8) instead of calling makewhatis
     directly.

FILES
     /etc/periodic/weekly/320.whatis      run makewhatis.local every week

SEE ALSO
     find(1), makewhatis(8), cron(8), periodic(8)

HISTORY
     The makewhatis.local utility appeared in FreeBSD 2.2.
