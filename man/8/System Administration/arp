ARP(8)                       System Manager's Manual                      ARP(8)

NAME
     arp – address resolution display and control

SYNOPSIS
     arp [-n] [-i interface] hostname
     arp [-n] [-i interface] [-l] -a
     arp -d hostname [pub] [ifscope interface]
     arp -d [-i interface] -a
     arp -s hostname ether_addr [temp] [reject] [blackhole] [pub [only]]
         [ifscope interface]
     arp -S hostname ether_addr [temp] [reject] [blackhole] [pub [only]]
         [ifscope interface]
     arp -f filename

DESCRIPTION
     The arp utility displays and modifies the Internet-to-Ethernet address
     translation tables used by the address resolution protocol (arp(4)).  With
     no flags, the program displays the current ARP entry for hostname.  The
     host may be specified by name or by number, using Internet dot notation.

     Available options:

     -a      The program displays or deletes all of the current ARP entries.

     -d      A super-user may delete an entry for the host called hostname with
             the -d flag.  If the pub keyword is specified, only the “published”
             ARP entry for this host will be deleted.  If the ifscope keyword is
             specified, the entry specific to the interface will be deleted.

             Alternatively, the -d flag may be combined with the -a flag to
             delete all entries.

     -i interface
             Limit the operation scope to the ARP entries on interface.
             Applicable only to the following operations: display one, display
             all, delete all.

     -l      Show link-layer reachability information.

     -n      Show network addresses as numbers (normally arp attempts to display
             addresses symbolically).

     -s hostname ether_addr
             Create an ARP entry for the host called hostname with the Ethernet
             address ether_addr.  The Ethernet address is given as six hex bytes
             separated by colons.  The entry will be permanent unless the word
             temp is given in the command.  If the word pub is given, the entry
             will be “published”; i.e., this system will act as an ARP server,
             responding to requests for hostname even though the host address is
             not its own.  In this case the ether_addr can be given as auto in
             which case the interfaces on this host will be examined, and if one
             of them is found to occupy the same subnet, its Ethernet address
             will be used.  If the only keyword is also specified, this will
             create a “published (proxy only)” entry.  This type of entry is
             created automatically if arp detects that a routing table entry for
             hostname already exists.

             If the reject keyword is specified the entry will be marked so that
             traffic to the host will be discarded and the sender will be
             notified the host is unreachable.  The blackhole keyword is similar
             in that traffic is discarded but the sender is not notified.  These
             can be used to block external traffic to a host without using a
             firewall.

             If the ifscope keyword is specified, the entry will set with an
             additional property that strictly associate the entry to the
             interface. This allows for the presence of multiple entries with
             the same destination on different interfaces.

     -S hostname ether_addr
             Is just like -s except any existing ARP entry for this host will be
             deleted first.

     -f filename
             Cause the file filename to be read and multiple entries to be set
             in the ARP tables.  Entries in the file should be of the form

                   hostname ether_addr [temp] [pub [only]] [ifscope interface]

             with argument meanings as given above.  Leading whitespace and
             empty lines are ignored.  A ‘#’ character will mark the rest of the
             line as a comment.

     -x      Show extended link-layer reachability information in addition to
             that shown by the -l flag.
