NAME
     mount_tmpfs â€“ mount a tmpfs volume

SYNOPSIS
     mount_tmpfs [-o options] [-i | -e] [-n max_nodes] [-s max_mem_size]
                 directory

DESCRIPTION
     The mount_tmpfs command creates a new tmpfs (in-memory file system) volume
     and attaches it to the global file system namespace at the location
     indicated by directory.

     The options are as follows:

     -o options        Options passed to mount(2) are specified with the -o
                       option followed by a comma separated string of options.
                       See the mount(8) man page for possible options and their
                       meanings.

     -i                Make the volume case-insensitive (default).

     -e                Make the volume case-sensitive.

     -n max_nodes      Set the maximum number of nodes available to the file
                       system to max_nodes.

     -s max_mem_size   Set the maximum total file system size to max_mem_size
                       bytes, unless suffixed with one of k, m, g, or t, which
                       denote kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte and terabyte
                       respectively.
