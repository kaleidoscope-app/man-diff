NAME
     KernelEventAgent â€“ utility to provide user interface on behalf of the
     kernel

SYNOPSIS
     KernelEventAgent [-dv] [-f fsname] [-t timeout]

DESCRIPTION
     The KernelEventAgent utility is responsible for displaying disk full and
     unresponsive file server messages.  It is not intended to be run directly,
     but rather started by the system.  The few options it has are intended as
     debugging aids.  Typically, allowing the system to start KernelEventAgent
     by itself, without any additional options, is the ideal configuration.

     The options are as follows:

     -d    Debug mode.  Do not fork into a detached process, and write messages
           to stderr as well as the system log.

     -v    Verbose mode.  System messages of LOG_INFO level and LOG_DEBUG level
           are raised to the LOG_NOTICE level.

     -f fsname
           The file system identified by fsname is also passed the timeout value
           via the VFS_CTL_TIMEO sysctl.

     -t timeout
           The timeout value, specified in seconds, is the amount of time to
           wait before the user is notified again after dismissing notice of an
           unresponsive network mount point.
