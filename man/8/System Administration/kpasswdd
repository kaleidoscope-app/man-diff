KPASSWDD(8)                  System Manager's Manual                 KPASSWDD(8)

NAME
     kpasswdd â€“ Kerberos 5 password changing server

SYNOPSIS
     kpasswdd [--addresses=address] [--check-library=library]
              [--check-function=function] [-k kspec | --keytab=kspec]
              [-r realm | --realm=realm] [-p string | --port=string] [--version]
              [--help]

DESCRIPTION
     kpasswdd serves request for password changes. It listens on UDP port 464
     (service kpasswd) and processes requests when they arrive. It changes the
     database directly and should thus only run on the master KDC.

     Supported options:

     --addresses=address
             For each till the argument is given, add the address to what
             kpasswdd should listen too.

     --check-library=library
             If your system has support for dynamic loading of shared libraries,
             you can use an external function to check password quality. This
             option specifies which library to load.

     --check-function=function
             This is the function to call in the loaded library. The function
             should look like this:

             const char * passwd_check(krb5_context context, krb5_principal
             principal, krb5_data *password)

             context is an initialized context; principal is the one who tries
             to change passwords, and password is the new password. Note that
             the password (in password->data) is not zero terminated.

     -k kspec, --keytab=kspec
             Keytab to get authentication key from.

     -r realm, --realm=realm
             Default realm.

     -p string, --port=string
             Port to listen on (default service kpasswd - 464).

DIAGNOSTICS
     If an error occurs, the error message is returned to the user and/or logged
     to syslog.

BUGS
     The default password quality checks are too basic.
