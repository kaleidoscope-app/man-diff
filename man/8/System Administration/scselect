SCSELECT(8)                  System Manager's Manual                 SCSELECT(8)

NAME
     scselect â€“ Select system configuration "location"

SYNOPSIS
     scselect [-n] [new-location-name]

DESCRIPTION
     scselect provides access to the system configuration sets, commonly
     referred to as "locations".  When invoked with no arguments, scselect
     displays the names and associated identifiers for each defined "location"
     and indicates which is currently active.  scselect also allows the user to
     select or change the active "location" by specifying its name or
     identifier.  Changing the "location" causes an immediate system re-
     configuration, unless the -n option is supplied.

     At present, the majority of preferences associated with a "location" relate
     to the system's network configuration.

     The command line options are as follows:

     -n  Delay changing the system's "location" until the next system boot (or
         the next time that the system configuration preferences are changed).

     new-location-name
         If not specified, a list of the available "location" names and
         associated identifiers will be reported on standard output.  If
         specified, this argument is matched with the "location" names and
         identifiers and the matching set is activated.
